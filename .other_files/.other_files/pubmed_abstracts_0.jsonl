{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "diabetes", "text": "BACKGROUND: The growth of premature infants is expected to be equivalent to \nhealthy fetal growth, but this is rarely achieved in practice. It is predicted \nthat many premature infants, especially severe premature infants, will be \ndischarged with growth restriction. Extrauterine growth retardation (EUGR) is \ndefined as growth below the 10th percentile of the growth curve at discharge at \ncorrected 36th/40th week of gestation, or a difference between birth and \ndischarge z-score\u2009>\u20091 SD. The aim of our study is to determine the differences \nbetween the INTERGROWTH-21ST and the Fenton chart in the assessment of \nextrauterine growth.\nMETHODS: Infants\u2009<\u20091500\u00a0g born or transferred in the first 24\u00a0h at Ankara \nUniversity NICU between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 were included. \nInfants with major congenital anomalies, unknown gestational age, chromosomal \nanomalies, hydrops fetalis, TORCH infection, infants born to substance abusing \nmothers, and infants who died during hospitalization were excluded.\nRESULTS: According to the Fenton, the rate of EUGR at discharge was 66.3%. There \nwas no significant difference between the groups EUGR and non-EUGR in gender, \ngestational diabetes, maternal smoking during pregnancy, placental abruption, \nmagnesium sulphate prophylaxis, development of respiratory distress, and need \nfor intubation in the first 3 days after birth. When patients were grouped \naccording to birth weight, the highest rate of EUGR according to the Fenton was \nfound in the group with a birth weight\u2009\u2264\u20091000\u00a0g (78.8%) (p\u2009=\u20090.036). The \nproportion of patients defined as SGA by INTERGROWTH-21ST was significantly \nhigher than by Fenton (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Comparing the mean z scores for body weight, \nheight and head circumference at birth and discharge calculated from the Fenton \nand INTERGROWTH-21 charts, the z scores for body weight and height at birth and \ndischarge were significantly lower in the INTERGROWTH-21 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Head \ncircumference z-scores at birth and discharge were found to be higher in the \nFenton chart than in the INTERGROWTH-21ST (p\u2009<\u20090.001). When EUGR rates were \nevaluated by body weight in Fenton and INTERGROWTH-21ST, the EUGR rate was found \nto be higher in Fenton (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results show that when INTERGROWTH-21ST and Fenton are \ncompared, INTERGROWTH-21ST is more sensitive in defining the SGA rate. The \nFenton is more sensitive in defining EUGR at discharge. These differences \nbetween the charts make it difficult to monitor the growth of premature infants \nand to follow comorbidities. Therefore, the establishment of ideal growth curves \nis of great importance both during hospitalization and after discharge of \npremature infants."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "diabetes", "text": "BACKGROUND: We study the classical problem of inferring ancestral genomes from a \nset of extant genomes under a given phylogeny, known as the Small Parsimony \nProblem (SPP). Genomes are represented as sequences of oriented markers, \norganized in one or more linear or circular chromosomes. Any marker may appear \nin several copies, without restriction on orientation or genomic location, known \nas the natural genomes model. Evolutionary events along the branches of the \nphylogeny encompass large scale rearrangements, including segmental inversions, \ntranslocations, gain and loss (DCJ-indel model). Even under simpler \nrearrangement models, such as the classical breakpoint model without duplicates, \nthe SPP is computationally intractable. Nevertheless, the SPP for natural \ngenomes under the DCJ-indel model has been studied recently, with limited \nsuccess.\nMETHODS: Building on prior work, we present a highly optimized ILP that is able \nto solve the SPP for sufficiently small phylogenies and gene families. A notable \nimprovement w.r.t. the previous result is an optimized way of handling both \ncircular and linear chromosomes. This is especially relevant to the SPP, since \nthe chromosomal structure of ancestral genomes is unknown and the solution space \nfor this chromosomal structure is typically large.\nRESULTS: We benchmark our method on simulated and real data. On simulated \nphylogenies we observe a considerable performance improvement on problems that \ninclude linear chromosomes. And even when the ground truth contains only one \ncircular chromosome per genome, our method outperforms its predecessor due to \nits optimized handling of the solution space. The practical advantage becomes \nalso visible in an analysis of seven Anopheles taxa."}

This study aimed to delineate the \nsubgroup-specific relationships between the two by exploring cumulative and \nthreshold effects.\nMETHODS: 3,040 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline evidence of DKD \nwere included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to \ninvestigate the potential relationship between HDL-C level and DKD risk. To \naddress subgroup heterogeneity, sex-stratified restricted cubic splines (RCS) \nwere employed to model nonlinear relationships. The optimal threshold was \nidentified through the maximum selected statistics and validated via 1,000 \nbootstrap iterations. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, diabetes duration, \nand metabolic status were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Survival analysis \nusing Kaplan-Meier curves further validated these threshold effects.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.13 years, 665 subjects (21.9%) \nprogressed to DKD. Overall, each 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level independently \nreduced DKD risk by 43%. RCS analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation \nbetween HDL-C and DKD risk (P\u2009for overall\u2009=\u20090.025, P\u2009for nonlinear\u2009=\u20090.317), \nwith increased risk reduction at lower concentrations, plateauing at higher \nlevels. A robust threshold of 0.93 mmol/L was identified, showing significantly \nstronger protection against DKD progression (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.69, \nP\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to the traditional cutoff (HR\u2009=\u20090.86, P\u2009=\u20090.109). Females \nshowed continuous protection (HR\u2009=\u20090.41, P\u2009=\u20090.009) without threshold \ndependency. The male and diabetes duration\u2009<\u200910 years subgroups exhibited \nthreshold effects at >\u20090.93 mmol/L without continuous protection. The \nmetabolically unstable (hypertension, poorly controlled glycemia, body mass \nindex (BMI)\u2009>\u200928\u00a0kg/m2) and BMI\u2009<\u200924\u00a0kg/m\u00b2 subgroups displayed dual effects \n(P\u2009<\u20090.05).

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "diabetes", "text": "Endothelial cell dysfunction is a fundamental injury of atherosclerosis \ncardiovascular disease (ASCVD), closely linked to ferroptosis, which is a novel \ntype of cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Several \nclinical trials have suggested that empagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of \nsodium glucose co-transporter 2, reduces the risk of hospitalization for heart \nfailure and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, \nlittle is known about the mechanism of EMPA in endothelial cell ferroptosis in \nASCVD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential mechanism of \nEMPA against ferroptosis induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) in endothelial \ncells.EA.hy926 human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in vitro and \nwere divided into four groups: The Control, RSL3, RSL3\u2009+\u2009low-concentration EMPA \nintervention and RSL3\u2009+\u2009high-concentration EMPA intervention groups. \nIron-dependent lipid peroxidation was assessed by detecting the fluorescence \nintensity of ferrous ion (Fe2+), lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and content \nof malondialdehyde (MDA). The expression of ferroptosis-related genes was \nassessed by RT-qPCR and western blotting. siRNA nuclear factor erythroid \n2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was transfected into EA.hy926 cells to measure the \nexpression of target genes.It was demonstrated that the level of MDA, Fe2+ and \nlipid ROS was higher in the RSL3-treated group compared with the EMPA \nintervention group, while EMPA markedly mitigated that effect. In addition, EMPA \ncan reverse the RSL3-induced low expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) \nand high expression of ACSL4 in endothelial cells, as evidenced by the \nupregulation of nuclear factor transcription factor nuclear factor, erythroid 2 \n(NFE2)-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression, while siNRF2 \ntransfection impaired the antiferroptosis effect of EMPA. The present study \nindicated that EMPA may inhibit RSL3-induced ferroptosis in endothelial cells by \nactivating the NRF2/heme oxygenase 1 gene pathway."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "diabetes", "text": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) poses a \nsignificant global health challenge, disproportionately affecting women. \nDiabetic women with HFpEF represent a high-risk subgroup, particularly after \nexperiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), exhibiting \nincreased mortality compared to men. While prolonged door-to-balloon (DTB) \ntimes, reflecting delayed reperfusion, are a critical factor in STEMI outcomes, \nthey alone do not fully capture the observed outcome variability in diabetic \nwomen. Using an integrated clinical and pre-clinical approach this study aimed \nto investigate the relative contributions of metabolic dysfunction and coronary \nartery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) to STEMI outcomes in women, beyond \nthe impact of DTB time.\nMETHODS: A retrospective case-control study analysed female STEMI patients \nundergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI, n\u2009=\u200940 T2D, n\u2009=\u200940 \nnon-diabetic controls), comparing clinical characteristics, treatment \nstrategies, and early outcomes. A preclinical model (female db/db mice) assessed \ncardiac function via echocardiography, Langendorff perfusions, and \nischemia-reperfusion protocols. Metabolome of heart, liver, and skeletal muscle \nwas assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: Our study reveals significantly higher mortality, impaired left \nventricular function post-pPCI, and increased implantable \ncardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation rates in diabetic STEMI patients, \nirrespective of DTB time, when compared to non-diabetic controls. Elevated \ninflammatory markers, acute hyperglycaemia and evidence of cardio-hepatic damage \nwere identified in T2D patients. db/db mice exhibited analogous T2D-associated \npathophysiology, including increased ischemia-reperfusion injury exacerbated by \nmetabolic disturbances in the myocardium, liver, and skeletal muscle versus \nnon-diabetic controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: In diabetic women, multiple factors beyond reperfusion delays \nexacerbate acute myocardial injury. This necessitates the development of \nsex-specific strategies to manage the cardiovascular complications of diabetic \nHFpEF. The db/db mouse model provides a relevant preclinical tool for future \nresearch as it mimics human T2D-associated HFpEF and STEMI outcome."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "asthma", "text": "BACKGROUND: Globally, climate change is causing frequent and severe extreme heat \nevents (EHEs). A large body of literature links EHEs to multiple health \nendpoints. While children's physiology and activity patterns differ from those \nof adults in ways that are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to such \nendpoints, research gaps remain regarding the specific impacts of EHEs on child \nhealth. This study evaluated pediatric emergency healthcare utilizations \nassociated with EHEs in Ontario.\nMETHODS: Applying a space-time stratified case-crossover design, associations \nbetween EHEs (same-day or lagged exposure to 2 consecutive days of daily maximum \ntemperatures above percentile thresholds) and 15 causes of pediatric emergency \nhealthcare use in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2015 were analysed using \nconditional quasi-Poisson regression. In primary analyses, EHEs were defined as \ntwo or more consecutive days with temperatures above the 99th percentile of \ntemperature within each respective forward sortation area (FSA). Emergency \nhealthcare use was measured using hospital admissions as an indicator of severe \noutcomes, and emergency department (ED) visits as a sensitive measure of \noutcomes.\nRESULTS: Relative to non-EHE days, EHEs increased the rates of pediatric \nhospital admissions for respiratory illnesses by 26% (95% CI: 14-40%), asthma by \n29% (16-44%); infectious and parasitic diseases by 36% (24-50%), lower \nrespiratory infections by 50% (36-67%), and enteritis by 19% (7-32%). EHEs also \nincreased the rates of ED visits for lower respiratory infections by 10% \n(0-21%), asthma by 18% (7-29%), heat-related illnesses by 211% (193-230%), \nheatstroke by 590% (550-622%), and dehydration by 35% (25-46%), but not for \nother causes. Admissions and ED visits due to injuries and transportation \nrelated injuries were negatively associated with EHEs. Neither all-cause \nhospital admissions nor ED visits were associated with EHEs.\nCONCLUSIONS: In Ontario, EHEs decreased the rates of pediatric emergency \nhealthcare utilization for injuries and increased the rates of respiratory \nillnesses, asthma, heat-related illnesses, heatstroke, dehydration, infectious \nand parasitic diseases, lower respiratory infections, and enteritis. Tailored \npolicies and programs that reflect the specific heat-related vulnerabilities of \nchildren to respiratory and infectious illnesses are warranted in the face of a \nrapidly warming climate."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "asthma", "text": "Allergic asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder driven by a T helper type 2 \n(Th2)-mediated immune response that involves eosinophils and mast cell \nrecruitment to affected tissues, eliciting inflammatory cytokines and IgE \nproduction.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "asthma", "text": "BACKGROUND: No biological treatment has been approved for pediatric eosinophilic \nesophagitis (EoE) in France. For patients refractory to conventional treatments, \nalthough compassionate use of monoclonal antibodies has developed, experience \nremains limited.\nMETHODS: We conducted a national multicenter study across French pediatric \ntertiary care centers where children (younger than 18 years) who presented with \nEoE were treated with biological therapies between January 2015 and December \n2023. The main objective was to characterize this patient population, and the \nindications for prescribing biologics. The secondary goals were to assess these \npatients' clinical, endoscopic, and histologic finding, as well as patient \ntolerance, and to compare our cohort at baseline with pediatric patients from \ntwo European registers of EoE treated with conventional therapies.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six patients were prescribed 37 biologics (omalizumab, n\u2009=\u20091; \nmepolizumab, n\u2009=\u20096; dupilumab, n\u2009=\u200930). At diagnosis, the mean patient age was \n7.4 (\u00b14.4) years, and most patients had at least one atopic comorbidity (91.7%, \nn\u2009=\u200933). Failure of first-line treatments was the main reason for starting \nbiological therapy (75.7%, n\u2009=\u200928), prescribed as compassionate use (54.1%, \nn\u2009=\u200920). Dupilumab showed significant clinical (48%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and histological \n(82.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) improvement. Compared with children treated with conventional \ntherapies, patients in our cohort at baseline presented significantly more \nasthma, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis, as well as more fibrostenotic \nphenotype and digestive symptoms. No severe side effect was reported within a \n6-12-month follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Dupilumab is the most frequently prescribed, and appears to be the \nmost effective biotherapy, regarding clinical and histologic remission. All \nbiologics were well-tolerated.\nIMPACT: Pending marketing authorization, biological therapies for pediatric \neosinophilic esophagitis are mainly prescribed after failure of first-line \ntreatments and on a compassionate basis in France. Dupilumab is the biotherapy \nmost frequently used, is associated with clinical and histological efficacy and \nis well-tolerated. Children and adolescents requiring biologics appear to be \nyounger and more severe at diagnosis than naive pediatric patients in Europeans \nregistries."}

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between \nCOVID-19 vaccination and COPD.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cohort study using COVID-19 immunization registry data. \nThe exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status, and the outcome was first \nhealthcare utilization for COPD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to \nassess the risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD.\nRESULTS: Of the 27,595,469 individuals, 93.9\u00a0% had received COVID-19 \nvaccination. The risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD was significantly \nlower in vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants (hazard ratio \n[HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.46, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.46-0.47).

In the subgroup analysis, the decreased risk \nof first healthcare utilization for COPD was less significant in participants \nwith frequent healthcare utilization, including the elderly, women, medical aid \nrecipients, and those with comorbidities, than their counterparts. Of these, the \nsmaller magnitude of the inverse association was observed in the pulmonary \ntuberculosis and asthma group. Regarding vaccination subtypes, the reduction was \nmore prominent among those with a single vaccination (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.27, 95\u00a0% \nCI\u00a0=\u00a00.26-0.29) and mRNA recipients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.35-0.36).\nCONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a decreased risk of first \nhealthcare utilization for COPD, particularly concerning mRNA vaccine and \nemergency room visits or hospitalizations. Among frequent healthcare utilizers, \nthe effect of vaccination is more pronounced in individuals with pulmonary \ntuberculosis or asthma than in those without pulmonary tuberculosis or asthma."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "hypertension", "text": "BACKGROUND: The role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in diabetic \nkidney disease (DKD) remains controversial. This study aimed to delineate the \nsubgroup-specific relationships between the two by exploring cumulative and \nthreshold effects.\nMETHODS: 3,040 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline evidence of DKD \nwere included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to \ninvestigate the potential relationship between HDL-C level and DKD risk. To \naddress subgroup heterogeneity, sex-stratified restricted cubic splines (RCS) \nwere employed to model nonlinear relationships. The optimal threshold was \nidentified through the maximum selected statistics and validated via 1,000 \nbootstrap iterations. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, diabetes duration, \nand metabolic status were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Survival analysis \nusing Kaplan-Meier curves further validated these threshold effects.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.13 years, 665 subjects (21.9%) \nprogressed to DKD. Overall, each 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level independently \nreduced DKD risk by 43%. RCS analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation \nbetween HDL-C and DKD risk (P\u2009for overall\u2009=\u20090.025, P\u2009for nonlinear\u2009=\u20090.317), \nwith increased risk reduction at lower concentrations, plateauing at higher \nlevels. A robust threshold of 0.93 mmol/L was identified, showing significantly \nstronger protection against DKD progression (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.69, \nP\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to the traditional cutoff (HR\u2009=\u20090.86, P\u2009=\u20090.109). Females \nshowed continuous protection (HR\u2009=\u20090.41, P\u2009=\u20090.009) without threshold \ndependency. The male and diabetes duration\u2009<\u200910 years subgroups exhibited \nthreshold effects at >\u20090.93 mmol/L without continuous protection. The \nmetabolically unstable (hypertension, poorly controlled glycemia, body mass \nindex (BMI)\u2009>\u200928\u00a0kg/m2) and BMI\u2009<\u200924\u00a0kg/m\u00b2 subgroups displayed dual effects \n(P\u2009<\u20090.05). Survival analysis confirmed lower cumulative DKD incidence with \nHDL-C\u2009>\u20090.93 mmol/L (P\u2009=\u20090.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals sex- and metabolic context-dependent \nheterogeneity in HDL-C-DKD associations: males and short-duration diabetes \nexhibited threshold effects (0.93 mmol/L), females showed continuous protection, \nand subgroups with hypertension, poorly controlled glycemia, or obesity \n(BMI\u2009>\u200928\u00a0kg/m\u00b2) exhibited both continuous protection and threshold effects. \nThese findings may inform individualized risk stratification in specific \npopulations."}

Research on the impact of HDP subtypes-preeclampsia/eclampsia (PE/E) \nand superimposed preeclampsia (SP)-on comprehensive outcomes for hospitalized \nneonates is relatively limited. Additionally, PE/E and SP often result in \nshorter gestational age (GA), and the role of GA in the preterm birth-related \ncomplications of these HDP subtypes remains unclear.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study identified a total of 989 cases \n(exposed group), including 845 cases of PE/E and 144 cases of SP . We randomly \nselected 989 normotensive pregnant women from the same period as controls \n(control group). Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for neonatal \noutcomes were calculated using logistic regression. Mediation analysis was \nconducted to investigate the role of GA in the relationship between HDP subtypes \nand preterm birth-related complications.\nRESULTS: Both PE/E and SP increased the risk of adverse birth outcomes, \nincluding preterm birth, small for gestational age, low birth weight, and \nasphyxia, as well as hematological complications such as neutropenia, \npolycythemia, and thrombocytopenia. PE/E and SP also increased the risk of \nhypoglycemia while decreasing the risk of pathologic jaundice, with no impact on \ninfection complications. Mediation analysis revealed that PE/E increased the \nrisk of intraventricular hemorrhage while reducing the risk of patent ductus \narteriosus and retinopathy of prematurity, both through direct effects (the \ndisease of PE/E itself) and indirect effects (via GA). SP increased the risk of \nneonatal respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular hemorrhage through \nindirect effects (via GA).\nCONCLUSION: PE/E and SP are key maternal diseases influencing the outcomes of \nhospitalized neonates, with GA playing an important mediating role in preterm \nbirth-related complications. Early monitoring and management of those mothers \nand infants are crucial to improving prognosis."}

Compared to women in the lowest tertile of total \nphysical activity/day, those in the highest tertile had lower odds of GDM (OR \n0.19; 95% CI: 0.38-0.93) and potentially lower odds of any APO (OR 0.69; 95% CI: \n0.43-1.11). Women with higher levels of total daily physical activity and higher \nlevels of MVPA had lower odds for the composite outcome HDP, GDM, and/or SGA (OR \n0.49; 95% CI: 0.28-0.87, highest tertile compared to lowest tertile and OR 0.53; \n95% CI: 0.28-1.01, >\u20091000 MET minutes/week compared to <\u2009500 MET minutes/week).\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased prepregnancy physical activity, including total daily \nactivity, may reduce the risk APOs. Promoting preconceptional everyday activity \ncould be key to improving pregnancy health. Larger studies are needed to confirm \nthese findings."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "hypertension", "text": "PURPOSE: Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related multisystem syndrome, \ncharacterized by the sudden onset of hypertension after 20\u00a0weeks' gestation. \nAlthough previous studies and meta-analyses found an association between \npre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease later in \nlife, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal. Furthermore, \nresearch conducted to date has not consistently excluded women with chronic \nhypertension and/or kidney disease prior to pregnancy, indicating a possible \nselection bias. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of the updated \nliterature on renal outcomes in women who were healthy prior to pregnancy and \nexperienced pre-eclampsia.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase for eligible studies. We included \nretrospective and prospective studies involving healthy women with pre-eclampsia \nand reporting kidney outcomes. Of the 2,796 titles originally screened, 9 \nstudies met our inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analytic model was \nused for statistical analysis.\nRESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the risk of developing chronic \nkidney disease and end-stage kidney disease later in life following \npre-eclampsia was found (meta-analytic risk ratios [95% confidence interval]: \n1.83 [1.16-2.89] and 8.96 [4.94-16.23], respectively), with high statistical \nheterogeneity. However, the only prospective study did not find a significant \nassociation between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although a significant association was identified, its clinical \nrelevance and causality remain unclear. Postpartum medical investigation in \nwomen affected by pre-eclampsia is essential, but long-term follow-up may not be \nindicated in the absence of underlying conditions. Only prospective studies \ncould clarify the relationship between pre-eclampsia and kidney disease in women \nwho were healthy before pregnancy."}

Traditional pressure- and \nvolume-centric methods of RV evaluation, including echocardiography and right \nheart catheterization, often fail to provide comprehensive, load-independent \nmeasures of RV function. The integration of these measures for pressure-volume \n(PV) loop analysis has emerged as a valuable tool, offering insights into RV \ncontractility, compliance, and ventriculoarterial coupling.

These approaches enable detailed \nassessment of RV function, enhancing prognostic capabilities in such conditions \nas PH, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and postsurgical \ninterventions like left ventricular assist device implantation and valve \nreplacement. Despite the potential of RV PV loop analysis, its clinical adoption \nhas been limited by technical complexities, cost, and the need for specialized \nexpertise. This underscores the importance of standardizing PV loop acquisition \ntechniques and validating surrogate markers, such as tricuspid annular plane \nsystolic excursion/pulmonary artery systolic pressure ratio, to improve \naccessibility and utility.

However, the relationship between the extent of DVT and outcomes \nafter thrombectomy has not been explored. The objective of this study was to \ncompare rates of post-thrombectomy DVT recurrence between patients with isolated \niliofemoral DVT and patients with iliofemoral DVT and extension more \nperipherally.\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of all patients \nwho underwent thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT from 2014-2023. Patients were \nstratified into two cohorts: (1) iliofemoral DVT without popliteal/tibial \nextension or (2) iliofemoral DVT with popliteal/tibial extension. The primary \noutcome was acute DVT recurrence and multivariable analysis was performed to \nidentify risk factors for recurrence. Chi-squared and t-tests were calculated \nfor categorical and continuous data, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was \nused to compare rates of acute DVT and chronic venous changes postoperatively. A \nP-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS: 222 patients were identified during the study period (76 isolated \niliofemoral DVT vs. 146 iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension) with a median \nfollow-up of 19 months. Patients who presented with iliofemoral DVT with \nperipheral extension were more likely to be older (57 vs. 50 years, p=0.004), \nhave hypertension (64% vs. 41%, p=0.001) or hyperlipidemia (58% vs. 40%, \np=0.01), and to have had surgery within the prior 6-months (29% vs. 17%, \np=0.04). Amongst female patients, those on hormone therapy were more likely to \nhave isolated iliofemoral DVT (17% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Patients with iliofemoral \nDVT with peripheral extension had a greater chance of developing recurrent acute \nDVT (48% vs. 20%, p<0.001) and chronic venous changes (51% vs. 30%, p=0.004) \nduring follow-up. Multivariable analysis showed a significant correlation \nbetween iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension (Odds ratio 3.8 [95% \nconfidence interval 1.7-8.7], p=0.001) and acute DVT recurrence. There were no \ndifferences in the rates of reintervention or death.\nCONCLUSION: More extensive peripheral thrombus burden was associated with higher \nrates of follow-up DVT recurrence in patients undergoing thrombectomy for \niliofemoral DVT. These findings suggest that such patients may require closer \nfollow-up and more aggressive anticoagulation therapy postoperatively. Moreover, \nour results provide a framework for further studies to specifically study the \nrole peripheral thrombus may play in venous hemodynamics and the development of \nrecurrent DVT and, ultimately, PTS."}

Understanding the role of these \ntherapeutic approaches is essential for optimizing patient outcomes in this \nchallenging clinical scenario.\nMETHODS: This case report details the rehabilitation of a 29-year-old female \nwith a history of pulmonary tuberculosis who developed post-tuberculosis pleural \neffusion. A structured physiotherapy protocol was implemented over four weeks, \ncomprising diaphragmatic stretching, aerobic conditioning, and resistance \ntraining. Outcomes were measured through objective assessments of respiratory \nperformance, including chest expansion and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).\nRESULTS: The patient exhibited marked improvements in respiratory parameters \nfollowing the intervention, with a notable increase in chest expansion and PEFR. \nThese enhancements suggest a positive impact of targeted physiotherapy on lung \nmechanics and overall respiratory efficiency.\nCONCLUSION: This case underscores the potential benefits of incorporating \ndiaphragmatic stretching and complementary physiotherapy techniques into the \nmanagement of post-tuberculosis pleural effusion. By addressing residual \npulmonary deficits, these interventions can significantly improve respiratory \nfunction and patient outcomes. Future studies should explore the broader \napplicability and long-term effects of such rehabilitation strategies in larger \ncohorts."}

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between \nCOVID-19 vaccination and COPD.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cohort study using COVID-19 immunization registry data. \nThe exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status, and the outcome was first \nhealthcare utilization for COPD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to \nassess the risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD.\nRESULTS: Of the 27,595,469 individuals, 93.9\u00a0% had received COVID-19 \nvaccination. The risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD was significantly \nlower in vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants (hazard ratio \n[HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.46, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.46-0.47). The decreased risk was \nmore evident for first emergency room visits or hospitalizations for COPD \n(HR\u00a0=\u00a00.24, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.24-0.25). In the subgroup analysis, the decreased risk \nof first healthcare utilization for COPD was less significant in participants \nwith frequent healthcare utilization, including the elderly, women, medical aid \nrecipients, and those with comorbidities, than their counterparts. Of these, the \nsmaller magnitude of the inverse association was observed in the pulmonary \ntuberculosis and asthma group. Regarding vaccination subtypes, the reduction was \nmore prominent among those with a single vaccination (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.27, 95\u00a0% \nCI\u00a0=\u00a00.26-0.29) and mRNA recipients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.35-0.36).\nCONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a decreased risk of first \nhealthcare utilization for COPD, particularly concerning mRNA vaccine and \nemergency room visits or hospitalizations. Among frequent healthcare utilizers, \nthe effect of vaccination is more pronounced in individuals with pulmonary \ntuberculosis or asthma than in those without pulmonary tuberculosis or asthma."}

This study systematically evaluated its \nanti-TB efficacy in vitro and in vivo.\nMETHODS: In vitro analyses encompassed antimicrobial susceptibility testing to \ndetermine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Mycobacterium \ntuberculosis H37Rv, 10 drug-susceptible clinical isolates, and 30 \nmultidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, alongside evaluations of minimal bactericidal \nconcentrations (MBCs) using H37Rv and seven clinical isolates. Additionally, \nintracellular anti-mycobacterial activity was assessed in H37Rv-infected \nmacrophages, and cytotoxicity was profiled through MTT assays on Vero cells. In \nvivo studies utilized acute and chronic murine tuberculosis infection models to \ninvestigate the dose-dependent efficacy of NTB-3119M (50 and 100\u00a0mg/kg) against \nH37Rv, with concurrent comparative histopathological analysis of lung and spleen \ntissues.\nRESULTS: NTB-3119M demonstrated superior in vitro potency against both \ndrug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains compared to first-line \nagents, Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RIF), Moxifloxacin (MOFX), Levofloxacin \n(LVFX), and Streptomycin (SM), exhibiting comparable activity to PBTZ169. \nTime-kill curves for NTB-3119M indicate its potent bactericidal activity. \nMeanwhile, No cytotoxicity was observed on Vero cells. Spontaneous resistant \nmutants of NTB-3119M appears at a frequency of 6.44\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-7 to 3.65\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6. Most \nimportantly, NTB-3119M demonstrates comparable activity of PBTZ169 and better \nbactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis than INH and RIF in the 50- and \n100- mg/kg groups in acute and chronic murine models.\nCONCLUSION: Our research provided comprehensive evidence that NTB-3119M with \nincreased water solubility and bioavailability based on previous research \nperformed excellent anti-tuberculosis activity and less cytotoxicity, which \neffectively tackled the undesirable drug properties associated with previous \nbenzothiopyrone derivatives. It is warranted that NTB-3119M, as a highly \npromising candidate anti tuberculosis drug, deserves further research and \nclinical trial."}

Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with the highest burden \nof TB and TB/HIV co-infection. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB \npresent significant challenges to TB care and control efforts, particularly \nmulti-drug-resistant TB, which poses a serious public health issue in low-income \ncountries such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of \ndrug-resistant TB and its associated factors among TB patients in Dilla \nUniversity Referral Hospital (DURH).\nMETHOD: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from March-2024 to \nMay-2024 among 216 pulmonary TB patients attending DURH. Gene Xpert MTB/RIF \nUltra and Xpert MTB/XDR assay was used to assess the pattern of drug resistance \nin TB. The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay was used to detect rifampicin resistance, \nwhile the Xpert MTB/XDR assay was employed to identify isoniazid resistance and \nresistance to second-line anti-TB drugs when rifampicin resistance was detected. \nData were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) \nversion 25.\nRESULT: In this study, out of 216 confirmed MTB cases, 5 (2.3%) were identified \nas drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), with mono-resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid \nat 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed a significant \ndifference in DR-TB prevalence between those with and without a history of \nanti-TB treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Notably, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was more \nprevalent among individuals with diabetes mellitus and those with a history of \nprevious treatment, showing p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Among the 216 confirmed TB cases, 5 cases of DR-TB were identified, \naccounting for 2.3%. DR-TB was more prevalent in patients with a history of \nanti-TB treatment, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced early detection and \nimproved treatment monitoring. Additionally, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was \nnotably prevalent in individuals with diabetes mellitus and prior treatment \nhistory, with p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively.

The worst scenario is that mask ventilation also failed, severe hypoxia \ndeveloped followed by cardiac arrest.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old child with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis \ndiagnosed with intestinal obstruction scheduled for emergency surgery. Due to \nhigh risk of aspiration, rapid sequence induction was applied. Although the \npreoperative airway assessment was normal, unexpectedly difficult airway was \nencountered. There was a failure of vocal cord exposure under video \nlaryngoscope. A crisis happened when mask ventilation failed.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "lung cancer", "text": "Plain Language Summary: This study describes treatment patterns in patients with \na type of lung cancer that is caused by a mutation in a gene called the \nepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Many kinds of EGFR mutations have been \nidentified and are grouped as \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cuncommon\u201d mutations. Patients with \nEGFR mutation-positive cancer are usually treated with tablets called EGFR \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which are very effective at silencing \nabnormal forms of EGFR that drive tumor growth. Unfortunately, tumors may \neventually become resistant to EGFR TKIs and alternative treatments are required \n(named \u201csecond-line treatments\u201d). There are several types of EGFR TKI available: \nfirst-generation (e.g. gefitinib, erlotinib); second-generation (e.g. afatinib, \ndacomitinib) and third-generation (osimertinib) TKIs. A few unanswered questions \nremain regarding the optimal use of EGFR TKIs. Firstly, which EGFR TKI is most \neffective against uncommon EGFR mutations and, secondly, what is the most \neffective second-line treatment after first-line treatment with an EGFR TKI? In \nthis study, we reviewed treatment patterns in 805 patients with lung cancer in \nJapan who received afatinib. We found that half of patients remained on \ntreatment for at least 13\u2009months, providing further evidence that afatinib is an \neffective therapy. Afatinib was effective in patients with uncommon and common \nEGFR mutations. The most common second-line treatment after afatinib was \nchemotherapy. Approximately a third of patients received another EGFR TKI after \nafatinib, most commonly osimertinib, which was the most effective second-line \ntreatment. Sequential afatinib and osimertinib treatment should be considered."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "lung cancer", "text": "BACKGROUND: Consolidative PD-L1 inhibitors after concurrent chemoradiotherapy \n(cCRT) have become standard care in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer \n(LA-NSCLC). However, the correlation between immune-related adverse event (irAE) \ncharacteristics and patient outcomes remains unclear.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study enrolled LA-NSCLC patients who received \nconsolidative PD-L1 inhibitors after CRT at four cancer centers. Patients who \nreceived CRT alone were also included for comparison. Associations between irAE \ncharacteristics, frequency, timing, affected systems, and severity, and \nprogression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Tumor \nimmune microenvironment (TIME) features were analyzed to identify subpopulations \nat higher risk of severe irAEs.\nRESULTS: Among 107 patients, 59 (55.1%) developed irAEs; 89.8% were grade 1-2 \nand 10.2% grade 3-4. Patients with irAEs had significantly longer PFS than those \nwithout. Late-onset, single-system, endocrine, and mild irAEs predicted better \nPFS. In contrast, patients with severe irAEs had worse survival than those \nwithout ICI consolidation. TIME analysis revealed that severe irAEs were \nassociated with higher CD103+CD8+ T cells infiltration. A\u2009>\u20091.545% cutoff for \nCD103+CD8+ T cells may help identify patients less likely to benefit from PD-L1 \ninhibitor consolidation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of irAEs, particularly late-onset, single-system, or \ngrade 1-2 correlated with greater benefit from consolidative PD-L1 inhibitors in \nLA-NSCLC. Conversely, severe irAEs predict poorer survival, even compared to no \nICI consolidation. Elevated CD103+CD8+ T cell infiltration may serve as a \nbiomarker to identify patients at risk of severe irAEs who may not benefit from \nimmunoconsolidation therapy."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "lung cancer", "text": "OBJECTIVES: Accurately predicting the pathological response of lymph nodes to \nneoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a \nchallenge. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of [18F]FDG PET/CT \nimaging in predicting lymph node response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in \nresectable NSCLC. We investigated the predictive value of dynamic changes in \nimaging features of both primary tumors and lymph nodes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 86 patients with stage IIB-IIIB NSCLC were \nenrolled. [18F]FDG PET/CT scans were conducted at baseline and after neoadjuvant \nchemoimmunotherapy, but before surgery. SUVmax and size of primary tumors and \nlymph nodes were measured, and their dynamic changes were analyzed to correlate \nwith nodal response. The predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under \nthe receiver operating characteristic curve. Event-free survival (EFS) was \nevaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nRESULTS: The metabolism composite index, which combines changes in SUVmax of the \nprimary tumor and post-treatment SUVmax of lymph nodes, significantly improved \nlymph node response prediction, with an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI: 0.772, 0.932), \nsensitivity of 0.783, and specificity of 0.811. Patients without a pathological \ncomplete response (pCR) had shorter\u00a0median EFS in the non-pCR/PET (N+) group \ncompared to the non-pCR/PET (N-) group (17 months vs 42 months, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: Integrating dynamic metabolic changes in the primary tumor with \npost-treatment lymph node metabolic status is highly effective in predicting \nlymph node response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. This method also helps \nidentify patients with less favorable prognoses within the non-pCR group.\nKEY POINTS: Question How effective is [18F]FDG PET/CT in predicting lymph node \nresponse to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in resectable NSCLC through dynamic \nchanges in metabolic features? Findings The integration of SUVmax changes in the \nprimary tumor with post-treatment SUVmax of lymph nodes achieved a predictive \naccuracy characterized by an AUC of 0.852. Clinical relevance The use of dynamic \nmetabolic changes from [18F]FDG PET/CT enhances the prediction of lymph node \nresponse and helps identify NSCLC patients with poor prognosis, allowing for \nimproved risk stratification and targeted postoperative interventions."}

The tumor in our study presented diagnostic challenges as an \natypical APH due to its substantial size (12\u00a0mm), the presence of indistinct \nborders in certain regions, an extensive growth pattern, the hobnail appearance \nof endothelial cells, and the mitotic count.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we present this case to help with proper diagnosis \nand treatment of the tumor, to emphasize additional characteristics of APH, to \nsummarize the clinicopathological features of this tumor as documented in the \nliterature, and to enhance the understanding of this tumor type, particularly \nthe differentiation between APH and low-grade angiosarcoma.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "breast cancer", "text": "BACKGROUND: Near Antwerp a 3M factory has been active since 1971 emitting PFAS, \nmainly PFOS, in the local environment. Production of C8 compounds was stopped in \n2002, production of other PFAS continued until 2024. This study aimed to examine \nthe association between internal PFAS concentrations and thyroid hormones, \nsexual hormones, and pubertal development in adolescents living in the \nneighborhood of the factory.\nMETHODS: We measured PFAS in serum of 146 female and 139 male adolescents. For \nmales sex hormones (LH, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin B, FSH) \nand SHBG were measured in serum. For males and females we assessed serum thyroid \nhormone levels (TSH, T3, T4 and T3/T4) and pubertal development parameters \nself-assessed through a standardized questionnaire. Associations between PFAS \nconcentrations and effect biomarkers/health effects were assessed through \nGeneralized Estimating Equations (GEE), using linear models for continuous \noutcomes, logistic models for binary outcomes, and proportional odds models for \nordinal outcomes.\nRESULTS: For males LH, total and bioavailable testosterone showed significant \nnegative associations with PFHxS and PFOA. LH and bioavailable testosterone also \nshowed significant negative associations with other PFAS compounds. SHBG showed \nsignificant positive associations with PFDA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFOS and the sum of \nthe linear forms of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS. Males' length and growth spurt \nshowed significant negative associations with PFOS, PFOA and PFAS sum parameters \nand length and growth spurt separately also with other PFAS compounds. For \nfemales growth spurt showed significant negative association with PFOA and a \nsignificant positive association with PFOS(branched). For both males and\u00a0females \nbody hair development showed significant negative associations with PFHxS, and, \nfor males and females separately also with other PFAS compounds. For females, \nbreast development showed significant negative associations with PFOA, pubertal \ndevelopment scale showed significant negative associations with PFOA, PFHxS, \nPFOS(linear) and the sum of 4 PFAS. For males, TSH showed a significant negative \nassociation with PFDA and FT3 showed significant positive associations with \nPFOA, PFOA and PFNA. For females, FT3 showed a significant negative association \nwith PFOS(branched).\nCONCLUSION: We observed significant, consistent and biologically relevant \nassociations of PFAS serum concentrations with sex hormone and SHBG levels in \nmale adolescents. Moreover, a significant delay in physiological processes \noccurring in puberty was observed in females and males. Associations with \nthyroid hormones differed significantly by sex."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "breast cancer", "text": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Telephone cancer information and support services \n(CISS) deliver essential evidence-based resources for people living with cancer. \nThis research aimed to describe how attributes and levels were developed for a \nfuture discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for operational \ncharacteristics of a CISS, focusing on Cancer Council Victoria's service.\nMETHODS: Using a mixed-methods approach guided by the ISPOR checklist for \nconjoint analysis in healthcare, initial attributes were developed using an \nartificial intelligence framework to analyse CISS calls (January 2018-December \n2021), focus groups with people with cancer and carers using the CISS \n(July-August 2022), and a systematic literature review of qualitative studies. A \nfour-stage descriptive process guided attribute and level development. An expert \npanel of researchers (n\u2009=\u200910), a CISS staff member, a person with lived \nexperience of cancer and a consumer-only panel (n\u2009=\u20097) met monthly to \nprioritise, refine and finalise attributes by consensus.\nRESULTS: Call data analysis (people with cancer n\u2009=\u20097701; carers n\u2009=\u20095500), six \nfocus groups (people with cancer n\u2009=\u200910; carers n\u2009=\u200911) and a systematic \nliterature review of qualitative studies generated 14 candidate attributes. The \nexpert panels selected seven final attributes, each with three levels: follow-up \ncall, operating hours, additional technology, operator type, operator \nconsistency, call length and service fee.\nCONCLUSIONS: Transparent reporting of the discrete choice experiment design \nprocess is essential for credible interpretation. The four-stage approach \nenhanced the comprehensibility of the experiment, as multi-modal data ensured \nthe selected attributes and levels accurately reflect CISS caller priorities, \nwhich may be applicable to other choice-based studies."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "breast cancer", "text": "OBJECTIVE: Early surgical menopause is associated with a higher risk of mild \ncognitive impairment among women in the general population; this association has \nnot been studied among women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. This study aimed to \ndescribe the impact of clinical and host factors including bilateral \noophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA \nmutation carriers.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study extends from a longitudinal observational \nstudy of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that has been ongoing since 1995. \nThe Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among \n752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability \nof amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test \ncompletion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, \nand was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host \nfactors were collected from biennial research questionnaires.\nRESULTS: There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild \ncognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a \nhigh probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 \nvs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer \nprevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low \nprobability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women \nwith a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those \nwith a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04).\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy \non the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation \ncarriers. A higher probability was predominantly attributed to older age at \ncognitive assessment. It is prudent to continue to monitor this population for \npotential long-term adverse effects following preventive surgery or cancer \ntreatment."}

The \nmedian age was 57.9 years, and 69.8% were postmenopausal women at diagnosis. \nMost tumors (88.1%) had ductal histology and were estrogen receptor-positive \n(81.7%). The median tumor size was 12 mm (Interquartile [IQR] 9.0-15.0). \nBreast-conserving surgery was performed in 77.8%, and radiotherapy was \nadministered in 76.1% of patients. Median follow-up was 5.8 years (IQR 5.0-6.8). \nIn total, 13 events were observed: 4 locoregional, 2 distant (1 bone and 1 \nvisceral) and 7 second nonbreast primary malignancies. The 5-year rwDFS rate was \n95.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 92.7-98.1), and rwOS was 97.9% (95% CI \n96.2-99.7).\nCONCLUSION: Our RW data supports the effectiveness of the APT regimen, showing \nexcellent 5-year survival outcomes in selected patients with low-risk HER2+ eBC."}

Managing treatment side effects and improving quality of life are \nimportant. While in-person dance programs have shown benefits, research on \nhome-based, theory-driven dance programs is limited. This study evaluated a \nhome-based, remote dance program using the biopsychosocial model to improve the \nquality of life in breast cancer patients and support its use in cancer care.\nMETHODS: The study was conducted from July 2023 to May 2024, carrying out online \nin each participant's home concurrently in Taiwan. A total of 66 breast cancer \npatients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n\u00a0=\u00a033) or a control \ngroup (n\u00a0=\u00a033). The experimental group participated in a weekly 60-min \nhome-based dance program, guided by the biopsychosocial model, for 12 weeks via \nonline software. The control group received standard care during this period. \nThe evaluation metrics included European Organization of Research and Treatment \nCancer-Quality of Life C30 and Breast Cancer 23 Questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30 \nand EORTC-QLQ-BR23) in the pre-and -post time during the intervention.\nRESULTS: Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed \nsignificant improvement in EORTC QLQ-C30 summary score (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03), symptoms \nsummary (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04), fatigue (p\u00a0=\u00a0.004), and EORTC QLQ-BR23 symptoms scales \n(p\u00a0=\u00a0.05) and breast symptoms scales (p\u00a0=\u00a0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study introduced a pioneering home-based remote dance program \nfor breast cancer patients, guided by the biopsychosocial model. The results \nshowed partial symptom relief and improved quality of life. It is recommended to \nincorporate this program, led by a professional instructor, into future breast \ncancer treatment plans."}

Due to its rarity, rectal malignant melanoma is \noften not considered in the initial differential diagnosis. In such clinical \nscenarios, avoiding misdiagnosis, achieving early detection, and providing \nappropriate treatment remain major challenges and require particular attention. \nThis case report presents a detailed account of the diagnostic and therapeutic \nprocess in a patient with primary rectal malignant melanoma. By sharing this \ncase, we aim to provide clinicians with practical experience and valuable \ninsights, thereby enhancing awareness and understanding of this rare condition \nwithin the medical community.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old female presented to the hospital with a 10-day \nhistory of a perianal mass and hematochezia. Physical examination revealed a \nsoft, flat abdomen with no palpable masses and normal bowel sounds. Imaging \nfindings showed localized thickening of the distal rectum, diffuse mild \nthickening of the mid-to-upper rectal wall, and multiple small lymph nodes in \nthe sigmoid mesocolon.Postoperative histopathological analysis, supported by \nimmunohistochemical staining, confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The \npatient underwent laparoscopic Miles surgery, followed by adjuvant \nabdominopelvic radiotherapy (GTVtb 50\u00a0Gy, CTV45 Gy) and targeted therapy with \ntislelizumab. She had an uneventful recovery and remained free of disease \nprogression during 48 months of follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case of rectal malignant melanoma, incidentally diagnosed \nduring hemorrhoidectomy, was successfully treated with laparoscopic Miles' \nprocedure and targeted immunotherapy, resulting in long-term disease-free \nsurvival, thereby raising clinical awareness and providing valuable insights for \nmanaging similar cases."}

The present \nstudy identified crotonylation as a therapeutic target in patients with p53 \ndeficiency or mutation in colorectal cancer. Crotonylome analysis revealed that \np53 deficiency upregulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) \nand HNRNPCK189Cr, promoting colorectal cancer cell proliferation by stabilizing \nCCND1 and MCM3 mRNAs through the MDM2/HDAC3 axis. Functional studies using \nHNRNPCK189Q (activating mutation) and HNRNPCK189R (inactivating mutation) \nconfirmed the role of HNRNPCK189Cr in tumor growth. HDAC3 was identified as a \nspecific decrotonylase of HNRNPCK189Cr. Sodium phytate, an HDAC3 agonist, \neffectively decrotonylated HNRNPCK189Cr and, in combination with HNRNPC siRNA, \nsignificantly inhibited the in vitro and in vivo growth of HCT116 p53-/- cells. \nAn AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer model in K14-cre; p53fl/fl mice validated \nthe role of the p53/MDM2/HDAC3/HNRNPCK189Cr axis in tumor progression. \nAdditionally, the findings in the oral cancer cells WSU-HN6 and non-small lung \ncancer cells H1299 were in line with those in the HCT116 cells, suggesting that \nthe p53/MDM2/HDAC3/HNRNPCK189Cr regulatory mechanism plays a key role in a \nconserved manner. These findings revealed a novel mechanism by which p53 \ndeficiency or mutation drives tumor progression via HNRNPCK189Cr through \nMDM2/HDAC3 axis-mediated CCND1 and MCM3 mRNA stability. Targeting HNRNPC and its \ncrotonylation with sodium phytate and HNRNPC siRNA offers a promising \ntherapeutic strategy, potentially converting p53 from an \"undruggable\" target to \na \"druggable\" target."}

Food-derived bioactive peptides \n(FDBPs) are natural, non-toxic, and cost-effective compounds that exhibit \nsignificant potential in combating CRC. However, a comprehensive review \nsummarizing FDBPs sources, peptide sequences, their anti-CRC effects, and \nunderlying mechanisms is still lacking. Consequently, the present study \ndiscussed the CRC inhibitory effects and action mechanisms of FDBPs from \ndifferent protein sources. We found that plant proteins, animal proteins, milk \nproteins, and microbial proteins are all ideal sources for producing peptides \nwith high anti-CRC activity. Several peptides isolated from these proteins can \npromote apoptosis, inhibit metastasis, reduce invasion of CRC, and finally \nsuppress tumor growth. Notably, low-molecular-weight FDBPs, particularly those \nbelow 1kDa and rich in Asp, Gln, Lys, Gly, and Ser, exhibit better stability and \nstronger anti-CRC efficacy. The anti-CRC activity of FDBPs is associated with \nbalancing the gut microbiota, activating the p38 MAPK pathway, and inhibiting \nthe PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; however, the upstream and downstream regulatory \nmechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, we discovered that nanoparticle and \nglycopeptide modifications can enhance the activity and stability of anti-CRC \npeptides, enabling more precise delivery to cancer sites. Our review will be of \ninterest for the design of natural anti-CRC drugs."}

This cross-sectional study assessed the \nutility of multiple plasma biomarkers for diagnosing and staging AD in a \nJapanese cohort.\nMETHODS: The assessed plasma biomarkers included A\u03b242/40, phosphorylated tau \n(p-tau181 and p-tau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and \nneurofilament light chain (NfL), individually and in combination. A\u03b242/40 was \nmeasured using the HISCL\u00ae platform, while all other biomarkers were measured \nusing the Simoa\u00ae platform. Participants were classified based on A\u03b2 PET imaging \nand neuropsychological testing into healthy controls (HC), AD continuum \n(preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment [AD-MCI], and mild dementia [AD-D]), \nand non-AD cognitive impairment (CI) groups. Receiver operating characteristic \nanalyses were performed to predict the A\u03b2 PET status, correlation with Centiloid \n(CL) values and cognitive scores, and biomarker comparisons across AD stages.\nRESULTS: Sixty-nine HC, 13 preclinical AD, 38 AD-MCI, 44 AD-D, and 79 non-AD CI \nparticipants were included. The area under the curves (AUCs) for predicting A\u03b2 \nPET status were 0.937 (A\u03b242/40), 0.926 (p-tau217), and 0.946 (p-tau217/A\u03b242); \nresults of pair-wise DeLong tests revealed no significant differences among \nthese three metrics (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). In the cognitively normal group, the AUCs \nwere 0.968 (A\u03b242/40), 0.958 (p-tau217), and 0.979 (p-tau217/A\u03b242), while in the \ncognitively impaired group, they were 0.919 (A\u03b242/40), 0.893 (p-tau217), and \n0.923 (p-tau217/A\u03b242). Among HC and AD continuum participants, CL correlations \nwere -\u20090.74 (A\u03b242/40), 0.81 (p-tau217), and 0.83 (p-tau217/A\u03b242). In the HC and \nAD continuum, A\u03b242/40 levels showed a bimodal distribution (cutoff\u2009=\u20090.096), \nwith a shift from high to low occurring at 19.3 CL, compared to the PET \npositivity threshold of 32.9 CL. P-tau217 exhibited a linear increase with \ndisease progression. All biomarkers correlated strongly with logical memory \nscores.\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarkers, A\u03b242/40 and p-tau217, and particularly their \nratio (p-tau217/A\u03b242), show strong potential as A\u03b2 PET alternatives for AD \ndiagnosis.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "alzheimer", "text": "BACKGROUND: Excessive daytime napping has been associated with neurodegeneration \nin older adults, but prior research has focused on nap duration and frequency. \nEmerging frameworks emphasize the multidimensionality of sleep, but it remains \nunknown whether other dimensions of napping (e.g., timing, variability) are \nlinked to neurodegeneration. To address this gap, we investigated the \nassociations of daytime nap timing and intraindividual variability of nap \nduration with incident Alzheimer's dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from 936 older adults (age range: 56-99; 77% female) \nin the Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine incident Alzheimer's dementia \nand from 320 deceased participants (age range at death: 71-105; 70% female) to \nexamine Alzheimer's pathology. The proportions of morning (9-11am) and early \nafternoon naps (1-3\u2009pm) and the intraindividual variability of nap duration were \nassessed using actigraphy. Participants completed neurological assessments at \nbaseline and annually for up to 17 years. In deceased participants, amyloid \u03b2 \nand neurofibrillary tangles were examined.\nRESULTS: Here we show that more morning naps are linked to a higher risk of \nAlzheimer's dementia, whereas more early afternoon naps are linked to reduced \namyloid \u03b2 levels. Higher intraindividual variability of nap duration is shown to \nbe associated with increased amyloid \u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that specific timing patterns and \nirregularities in daytime napping are linked to Alzheimer's disease risk and \npathology. Multi-dimensional assessments of nap behaviors may aid in risk \nstratification for neurocognitive impairment and offer a potential target for \ninterventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging."}

However, how the timing \nand regularity of daytime naps link to cognitive health remain unclear.

Disease-modifying treatments that can slow \ndisease progression are now becoming available for patients with early-stage \nAlzheimer's disease, including those with mild cognitive impairment. However, \nchallenges in diagnosis and assessment for these patients remain.\nOBJECTIVES: This study characterized the care pathway for mild cognitive \nimpairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia, including barriers to care, and \nconsidered the future treatment landscape, with the aim of making \nrecommendations for optimizing the care pathway in readiness for the \navailability of new disease-modifying treatments.\nDESIGN: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews.\nSETTING: Interviews were conducted with physicians in general/tertiary hospitals \nin Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nTaiwan, and Thailand. Physicians from mainland China and Japan were not \nincluded.\nPARTICIPANTS: Physicians managing patients with mild cognitive impairment.\nMEASUREMENTS: Number and/or proportion of participants providing a given \nresponse, and numerical estimates provided by interview participants.\nRESULTS: Forty-four physicians, primarily neurologists (n = 31; 70.5 %), were \ninterviewed. Participants managed a median of 67.5 patients with mild cognitive \nimpairment per month, of whom 24.0-87.5 % had mild cognitive impairment due to \nAlzheimer's disease. Clinical investigations routinely comprised brief \nneuropsychological assessments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (n = \n41), as well as neurological tests (n = 39) and magnetic resonance imaging (n = \n40). Except in Korea, comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries and \namyloid positron emission tomography were seldom conducted in Asia. Most \npatients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease were treated \nwith nootropics and/or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Korea, 96 %; all other \nregions, 69 %), and almost all were recommended a non-pharmacological treatment \n(Korea, 93 %; all other regions, 100 %). Detection of mild cognitive impairment \ndue to Alzheimer's disease was considered prompt in Korea but suboptimal in \nother regions (n = 16) owing to low disease awareness among patients. Barriers \nto assessment and diagnosis included delayed healthcare visits for initial \nassessment (n = 7), neuroimaging backlogs (n = 6), and insufficient \nneuropsychology resources (n = 13). Access to amyloid biomarker tests, including \namyloid positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and blood \ntests, was limited in regions other than Korea.\nCONCLUSIONS: The survey findings showed that screening and diagnostic processes \nfor mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia require further \noptimization. Efforts should also be made to educate patients and caregivers, \nimprove the diagnostic capabilities of primary and secondary healthcare \nproviders, and reinforce cognitive screening services. The provision and \nreimbursement of confirmatory tests of amyloid burden should be expanded across \nthe region to facilitate access to innovative disease-modifying therapies."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "alzheimer", "text": "BACKGROUND: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCRS) is a predementia syndrome, \nand its prevention is valuable for reducing the incidence of dementia. However, \nfew studies have focused on the association between indoor air pollution caused \nby household cooking fuel use and MCRS. This study aimed to investigate whether \nclean cooking fuel use is associated with reduced MCRS risk and whether the \ntiming of clean fuel adoption across the life span is associated with MCRS \nprevalence.\nMETHODS: We used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. A \nprospective cohort analysis (n = 4251) examined baseline fuel use (2011) and \nincident MCRS over four years. A cross-sectional life course analysis (n = 6964) \nlinked retrospective fuel use histories (2014 life history survey) to MCRS \nstatus in 2015. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks \n(RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for covariates.\nRESULTS: In the cohort study, clean fuel use at baseline was associated with a \nreduced risk of MCRS (RR = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.61-0.96). Lower risks were also \nobserved among participants who transitioned from solid to clean fuels and those \nwho consistently used clean fuels. In the life course analysis, clean fuel \nadoption in early or middle adulthood was linked to lower MCRS prevalence.\nCONCLUSION: Clean fuel use for cooking and transitioning from solid to clean \nfuels decreases MCRS risk among older adults. Moreover, earlier adoption of \nclean cooking fuels is associated with a lower prevalence of MCRS in later life."}

Initially identified in the 1980\u202fs, \nexosomes are formed within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through the invagination \nof the endosomal membrane, leading to the creation of intraluminal vesicles \n(ILVs). These ILVs can either be degraded by lysosomes or released into the \nextracellular space as exosomes, facilitating intercellular communication.

This study presents a novel protocol for \nthe isolation and proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from the substantia \nnigra (SN) of rat brains. By employing a combination of differential \ncentrifugation and immunocapture techniques, we achieved a purer exosome \nfraction and higher exosome yield compared to traditional ultracentrifugation \nmethods. Our proteomics analysis identified 51, 48, and 70 proteins from three \ndistinct exosome samples (SN-EV-1, SN-EV-2, and SN-EV-4), with Gene Ontology \nannotation revealing their involvement in diverse biological functions. This \nresearch not only establishes a reliable method for isolating brain-derived \nexosomes but also sets the stage for comparative studies between healthy and \nneurodegenerative conditions.

However, the potential mechanism remains \nunclear. Neuroimaging studies have found that tPBM-induced physiological changes \nexist in both targeted and non-targeted brain areas, suggesting the necessity of \nunderstanding the modulation mechanism from the perspective of the whole brain \nlevel.\nOBJECTIVE: This randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled crossover study aimed \nto investigate the hypothesis that tPBM improved working memory in healthy older \nadults through the mechanism of optimizing the properties of the resting-state \nfunctional brain networks.\nMETHODS: A total of 55 right-handed healthy older adults were randomly assigned \nto sham tPBM session group or active tPBM session group. After a washout \ninterval, they were assigned to the opposite intervention session. Each session \nincluded the following: active or sham tPBM application with a 1064-nm laser to \nthe left forehead; before and after, resting-state functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements; and the digital n-back task. Differences in \naccuracy and reaction time of the n-back task, and changes in functional \nconnectivity and graph metrics of the brain networks were investigated and \ncompared between the active and sham tPBM sessions. In addition, correlations \nbetween tPBM-induced changes in functional brain networks, and the n-back task \nwere examined.\nRESULTS: The results showed that compared with the sham tPBM session, the \naccuracy and reaction time during 3-back task significantly improved in the \nactive tPBM session. In addition, the global efficiency, local efficiency, nodal \nefficiency, and functional connectivity significantly increased in the active \ntPBM session, particularly in the frontoparietal areas. Importantly, the altered \n3-back accuracy was positively correlated with the changes of functional \nconnectivity and nodal efficiency mainly in left prefrontal cortex in those who \nhad increased 3-back accuracy in the active tPBM session.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that tPBM may serve as an effective tool to \nimprove working memory in older adults through the modulation of resting-state \nfunctional brain network properties. Investigations in large-scale samples are \nneeded to further validate the findings of this study."}

The variation in sample size (range: 398,775-414,232) reflects \ndifferences across specific domain-level data completeness. Seven biomarkers \nreflecting functional ability across the five IC domains were used to compute a \ncomposite IC score ranging from 0 (optimal IC) to +4 (most impaired IC). The \nassociations between IC scores and incident depressive disorders were also \nassessed.\nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 10.6\u202fyears (cutoff date: December 31, \n2022), 42,537 new cases of psychiatric disorders were recorded, of which 13,464 \n(31\u202f%) were attributed primarily to depression. A progressive increase in the \nprevalence of individual IC impairments was observed along with the rising \nincidence of depression. In multivariable models, higher IC scores were \nsignificantly associated with an increased risk of depression: hazard ratio (HR) \n[95\u202f% confidence interval (CI)] of 3.91 (3.44-4.45) in men (C-index\u202f=\u202f0.66) and \n3.94 (3.57-4.35) in women (C-index\u202f=\u202f0.66). These associations were confirmed \nusing sensitivity analysis. As this was an observational study, reverse \ncausality cannot be ruled out.\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher IC impairment scores are associated with an elevated risk of \ndeveloping depressive disorders. While causality cannot be inferred, the measure \nof IC may be used to identify individuals who are at higher risk, and to guide \nearly, targeted preventive strategies."}

Clinical \ntrials published before April 2024 that reported the effect of chronic exercise \non EF in individuals with PD were included.\nRESULTS: Of 608 identified studies, 18 studies met eligibility criteria. The \noverall effect size (ES) of exercise on EF was small but positive and \nsignificant (ES= 0.21, p <.001). Among EF subdomains, cognitive flexibility \nshowed significant improvement. Regarding exercise prescription, larger ES were \nobserved for high (\u22652 per week) frequency, moderate to vigorous intensity, \nmind-body exercise, and 45-60minutes for each session. Sample characteristics \nsuch as older age, high levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) (\u2265600mg/day), \nand baseline cognitive impairment were found to attenuate the effect of exercise \non EF.\nCONCLUSION: Exercise is a promising non-pharmacological intervention for \nenhancing EF in PD, particularly improving cognitive flexibility. Mind-body \nexercises appear particularly effective. Recommended programs should be moderate \nto vigorous in intensity, lasting 45-60minutes, and conducted at least twice \nweekly for 13-16 weeks. The benefits of exercise diminish with age and with LEDD \nexceeding 600mg/day. Additionally, PD patients with cognitive impairments may \nexperience reduced benefits. Early exercise engagement is recommended, while \ndisease severity and duration have minimal impact."}

The severity of COVID-19 varies, ranging from \nasymptomatic cases to mild symptoms, acute respiratory failure and death. \nGenetic factors are believed to influence individual responses to the virus. \nThis study investigates the association between two common single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNPs) in Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-TLR2 rs3804099 (+597 C/T) and \nTLR4 rs4986790 (+896 A/G)-and disease severity and inflammatory markers in \nMoroccan COVID-19 patients.

Complete blood count samples, along with levels of C-reactive protein \n(CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin and D-dimer, were assessed using automated \nmethods. No significant associations were observed between either SNP in TLR2 \nand TLR4 and disease severity under various genetic models.

Apart from liver disease arising from hepatitis C viral infection, \nmost chronic liver diseases currently have no cure. Several therapeutic \nalternatives, including some natural products, have been proposed to treat liver \ndiseases. The natural product Jatropha dioica has been reported to possess \nantioxidant activity and, by extension, could have hepatoprotective activity. \nAccordingly, our aim was to test the hypothesis that an extract of J. dioica is \nprotective against liver damage induced by valproic acid (VPA).\nMETHODS: Twelve male and twelve female Wistar rats were sorted into four groups: \ncontrol, non-toxicity, valproic acid control (VPA-C), and J. dioica + VPA \n(JdVPA). J. dioica (300 mg/kg, given orally) was used as treatment, followed by \na concomitant injection of VPA (500 mg/kg, i.p.) for the first 4 days to induce \nliver injury. To evaluate the severity of the injury, liver function tests were \nperformed. In addition, oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified, as well as \nmeasures of the expression of the genes Actb, Il6, and Nfkb1.\nRESULTS: The VPA-C group showed a significant increase in alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malondialdehyde \n(MDA), a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a reduction in glutathione \n(GSH) vs the control group. The JdVPA group showed a significant decrease in \nALT, AST, and MDA and an increase in GSH and SOD vs the VPA-C group. Gene \nexpression of Il6 and Nfkb1 did not show any statistically significant \ndifferences between study groups. Histologically, VPA presented an inflammatory \ninfiltrate, which decreased in the JdVPA group.\nCONCLUSION: The extract of J. dioica at the administered dose did not display \ntoxicity and was capable of ameliorating the liver injury generated by VPA in \nbiochemical and oxidative stress biomarkers, which suggests its potential \nhepatoprotective activity."}

Patients were divided into 3 groups, based on RC tertiles \n(Q1-3), and 4 multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify \nthe associations between RC levels and ACLF prognoses; these analyses excluded \ndifferent confounding factors, based on the Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Stratified analysis was \nconducted to investigate the association between RC and ACLF risk among \ndifferent subgroups, based on age, sex as well as complications and artificial \nliver treatment. RC accuracy versus that of other lipid indicators to predict \n28- and 90-day ACLF survival was evaluated by restricted cubic spline and \nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, while Kaplan-Meier \ncurves measured cumulative 28- and 90-day mortality risks.\nRESULTS: For all 4 regression models, higher RC were associated with worse liver \nfunction, coagulation, and HBV-ACLF prognoses. Restricted cubic spline analysis \nidentified a non-linear relationship between RC and HBV-ACLF prognoses, in which \nthe Q3 RC tertile had the lowest 28-day and 90-day HBV-ACLF survival rates; this \nwas further confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, subgroup analysis \nfound that higher RC correlated to worse ACLF prognoses among hypoproteinemia \npatients. Moreover, RC, compared to total cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and \nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as non-high density lipoprotein, \nwas the most accurate in predicting poor 28- and 90-day ACLF prognoses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated RC was significantly associated with poorer 28- and 90-day \nHBV-ACLF prognoses, even after accounting for all other traditional risk \nfactors. Therefore, monitoring RC, along with interventions to reduce their \nlevels, could aid in improving ACLF patient outcomes."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "hepatitis", "text": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of hepatitis B virus carriers combined \nwith gestational diabetes mellitus (HBVC & GDM) on pregnancy outcomes in a \ncohort of pregnant women from Hangzhou, China.\nMETHODS: We set-up a retrospective cohort study to analyze data from 12,815 \npregnant women who delivered in three Hangzhou tertiary hospitals between 2015 \nand 2022. Four groups were created according to the presence of HBV and/or GDM \nas follows: a non-HBVC & GDM group (n\u2009=\u20095,323), a HBVC group (n\u2009=\u20095,508), a GDM \ngroup (n\u2009=\u2009919) and a HBVC & GDM group (n\u2009=\u20091,065). Univariate analysis was \ncarried out with the Mann-Whitney U test or the chi-squared test; P\u2009<\u20090.05 was \nused as the screening criterion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was \nthen performed to investigate the effects of each of the relevant confounders on \nHBVC, GDM and HBVC & GDM. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, \nthe results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals \n(95% CIs), with P\u2009<\u20090.05 considered as statistically significant.\nRESULTS: The incidence of HBVC & GDM among pregnant women in Hangzhou, China was \n0.96% (95% CI: 0.90-1.02%). The median maternal age of the pregnant women in the \nHBVC & GDM group was significantly higher than that in the HBVC, GDM and control \ngroups (31.00 vs. 30.00, 30.00, 29.00, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The proportions of low birth \nweight (4.0% vs. 3.8%, 3.4%, 3.4%) and macrosomia (6.8% vs. 5.4%, 3.7%, 4.3%) in \nthe HBVC & GDM group were significantly higher than in the other three groups, \nwith significant differences between groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Multivariate logistic \nanalysis revealed a progressive increase in risk values with increasing maternal \nage in the HBVC & GDM group (OR\u2265\u200925&<30=1.632, OR\u2265\u200930&<35=3.257, and \nOR\u2265\u200935=5.611). In addition, the carriage risk of pregnant women over 35 years \nwas approximately two-fold higher than that in the HBVC and GDM groups \n(5.611/2.251 and 5.611/3.130), respectively. The risk value increased \nprogressively with increasing gravidity (OR2\u2009=\u20091.364 and OR\u2265\u20093=1.765). The risk \nof a floating population was as follows: Zhejiang-registered but non-Hangzhou \n(OR\u2009=\u20092.246)\u2009>\u2009outside Zhejiang Province (OR\u2009=\u20091.953)\u2009>\u2009Hangzhou-local (OR\u2009=\u20091). \nHBVC & GDM also increased the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy \n(ICP) (OR\u2009=\u20093.143, 95% CI: 2.223-4.445), pre-eclampsia (PE) (OR\u2009=\u20092.017, 95%CI: \n1.315-3.095), macrosomia (OR\u2009=\u20091.548, 95% CI: 1.161-2.064), assisted vaginal \ndelivery (OR\u2009=\u20091.501, 95% CI: 1.185-1.901) and Caesarean section (OR\u2009=\u20091.258, \n95% CI: 1.035-1.528). HBVC & GDM also reduced the chance of delayed labor \n(gestational age\u2009>\u200941 week, OR\u2009=\u20090.217, 95% CI: 0.126-0.374).\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of HBVC and GDM among pregnant women in \nHangzhou City are relatively high. When HBVC & GDM co-existed, the risks of ICP, \nPE and macrosomia increased significantly. The risk of HBVC & GDM tended to \nincrease progressively with increasing maternal age and increasing gravidity. \nFor pregnant women of advanced age, those with increasing gravidity or those in \na floating population, it is important to enhance educational awareness related \nto HBV, GDM, and especially HBVC & GDM in order to provide personalized \nantenatal medical care and reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "hepatitis", "text": "BACKGROUND: Acanthamoeba is one of the most common environmental protozoans with \na global distribution. Acanthamoeba parasites can be isolated from contact \nlenses, cleaning solutions, ventilation systems, dental treatment units, \ndialysis units, and emergency showers. Since the genus Acanthamoeba can lead to \ndangerous infectious diseases in immunocompromised patients, monitoring medical \ncenters and hospitals admitting these patients, who are more susceptible to \nthese infections, is of great importance. This study aimed to isolate, analyze, \nand characterize Acanthamoeba strains obtained from high-risk medical centers in \nKhorramabad city, western Iran, using parasitological (culture and microscopic \nexamination) and molecular (LAMP, PCR, and sequencing) methods.\nMETHODS: In this study, 53 dust samples were collected from four high-risk \nhealthcare facilities in Khorramabad City, Western Iran. After being transferred \nto the laboratory, the samples were cultured in a non-nutritive agar culture \nmedium, and samples with positive cultures were selected for molecular analysis. \nPCR and LAMP molecular methods targeting 18srRNA gene-specific primers were used \nto analyze the samples. For molecular confirmation and determination of \nAcanthamoeba genotypes, 4 randomly selected samples of PCR products were \nsequenced. The data was analyzed by SPSS-21 software.\nRESULTS: The culture and microscopic examination showed that 31 out of 53 \nsamples (58.5%) collected from high-risk healthcare facilities were positive for \nthe Acanthamoeba parasite. All the positive samples by the culture method were \nalso positive in the PCR assay. Out of 53 examined samples, 26 were positive by \nthe LAMP technique regarding the presence of the Acanthamoeba parasite. \nSequencing results of 4 sequenced samples showed T4 genotypes, Acanthamoeba sp., \nand Acanthamoeba culbertsoni.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the environment of high-risk \nhealthcare facilities in Khorramabad city is contaminated with Acanthamoeba, and \nthe pathogenic T4 genotype is present among the positive samples. Given the \nsevere health implications of Acanthamoeba infections, educating \nimmunocompromised patients about transmission routes and effective preventive \nmeasures is crucial. This would help raise awareness and promote safety \nprotocols in healthcare facilities to avoid contamination."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "arthritis", "text": "OBJECTIVES: The genetic basis of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease \nis unknown. This limits the development of therapeutic strategies. We aimed to \nanalyse a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a large administrative \ndatabase to identify new candidate causal genes for CPPD disease.\nMETHODS: We used publicly available GWAS summary statistics for Phecode-defined \nchondrocalcinosis and crystal arthropathy from the Veterans Affairs Million \nVeteran Program in people of African (AFR) and European (EUR) ancestry. Included \nwere 3004 (536 AFR and 2468 EUR) cases for chondrocalcinosis and 3766 (700 AFR \nand 3066 EUR) cases for crystal arthropathy (operationally interpreted as \ncalcium crystal arthropathy). Our primary analysis was in chondrocalcinosis, \nwith secondary analysis in crystal arthropathy. We tested for colocalisation of \nchondrocalcinosis genetic association signals with genetic control of gene \nexpression.\nRESULTS: There were 2 genome-wide significant loci for chondrocalcinosis in both \nAFR and EUR cases, both on chromosome 6 (signals within the ENPP1 and RNF144B \ngenes). Findings were supported by analysis of the crystal arthropathy cohort. \nColocalisation analysis of chondrocalcinosis genetic association signals with \ngenetic control of gene expression and alternative splicing further supported \nENPP1 and RNF144B as candidate casual genes. At ENPP1, the allele that increases \nthe risk for chondrocalcinosis was associated with increased ENPP1 expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: ENPP1 encodes ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase \nfamily member 1 (NPP1) that produces adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inorganic \npyrophosphate which, together with calcium ions, leads to the formation of \ncalcium pyrophosphate crystals. Selective NPP1 inhibitors developed for \ninfectious disease and cancer could be tested as treatment for CPPD disease."}

Although \ntextured insoles appear promising as an intervention for balance enhancement, \nresearch has yet to fully explore their long-term effectiveness in this specific \npatient population.\nMETHOD: Twenty-two participants (11 with knee OA, 11 healthy controls) underwent \nbalance assessment using the NeuroCom system. Measurements included Limits of \nStability test parameters and Tandem Walk parameters evaluated at baseline, \nimmediately after textured insole insertion, and following three months of \ncontinuous use.\nRESULTS: At baseline, the knee OA group showed significantly poorer performance \nin reaction time (p\u00a0=\u00a0.022), step width (p\u00a0=\u00a0.032), and movement speed \n(p\u00a0=\u00a0.003) compared to controls. With immediate application of textured insoles, \nthe knee OA group demonstrated significant improvements in reaction time \n(p\u00a0=\u00a0.029) compared to baseline, while the control group showed no significant \nimmediate changes.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "arthritis", "text": "INTRODUCTION: The Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a frequent cause of hand \nsymptoms and activity limitations, which is associated with various personal \nrisk factors. However, the association between these risk factors and CTS under \nconditions of cumulative exposure to the risk factors remains unclear.\nMETHOD: In this study, we utilized a cumulative risk score to assess the \nprevalence level of CTS , and further evaluated the interactions between \ndifferent risk factors and their cumulative association with CTS. Specifically, \nwe first conducted a univariate regression analysis to evaluate the independent \nassociation of risk factors with CTS. Then we ran the multivariate regression \nmodel to filter out significant risk factors from risk factors associated with \nCTS. Next, we constructed the risk score to represent the cumulative association \nof significant risk factors with CTS, and we analyzed the relationship between \nthe risk score and the prevalence level of CTS.\nRESULTS: The experiment results demonstrated that among the various personal \nfactors, sex, age, BMI, sleep disorder, smoking frequency, restlessness, \ndiabetes, kidney failure, arthritis, and joint pain were the most significant \nfactors related to CTS. There existed the cumulative association of risk factors \nwith CTS, and the cumulative association of risk factors was positively related \nwith an increased prevalence level of CTS. Moreover, there existed a critical \nthreshold (risk score = 3) for the increase in the prevalence level of CTS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the significant risk factors among personal \nfactors related with CTS, and presents the cumulative association of these risk \nfactors with CTS. Moreover, we offer the actionable suggestions for CTS \nprevention based on the experiment results.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The occurrence of CTS is associated with various risk \nfactors. Identifying the independent and cumulative association of different \nrisk factors is essential for designing effective preventive measures and \ninterventions for CTS. Therefore, this study could be important for health \nmanagement in CTS and other similar diseases."}

Recently, hemoglobin and anemia have \nreceived more attention as predictors of maternal obesity. No such study exists \nin Rwanda. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the \nfactors associated with obesity, including hemoglobin and anemia, among pregnant \nwomen in Kigali, Rwanda.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals in Kigali, \nRwanda, from June to August 2024. A questionnaire was used to collect \nsociodemographic data. Weight, height, and hemoglobin were measured using \nstandard procedures. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: A total of 445 pregnant women were recruited. The median (interquartile \nrange [IQR]) age and parity were 30.0 (26.0\u201235.0) years and 1 (0\u20123), \nrespectively. Of the 445 women, 143 (32.1%), 249 (56.0%), and 53 (11.9%) were of \nnormal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. One hundred and seven \n(24.0%) pregnant women had anemia. In multivariate multinomial regression, no \nsignificant association was found between age, parity, residency, education, \nmaternal occupation, hemoglobin level, anemia, and overweight status. Being from \nrural areas (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u2009=\u20092.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] \n1.16\u20125.56) and being a housewife (AOR\u2009=\u20094.34, 95% 1.42\u201213.26) were significantly \nassociated with obesity. While an increase in hemoglobin level was associated \nwith obesity (AOR\u2009=\u20091.28, 95% CI 1.02\u20121.60), anemia was inversely negatively \nassociated with obesity (AOR\u2009=\u20090.33, 95% CI 0.12\u20120.93).\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that 12% of the pregnant women in Rwanda were \nobese. Hemoglobin and anemia are associated with maternal obesity in Rwanda. \nThere is a need for more efforts in nutritional programs targeting pregnant \nwomen to combat maternal obesity in Rwanda.

All included studies were assessed for quality using the \nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scale. Data were analyzed using Stata 15 software.\nRESULTS: A total of 18 articles (n\u2009=\u2009424,158) were included, meta-analysis \nresults suggest that increased intraoperative bleeding [OR\u2009=\u20091.13, 95%CI (1.02, \n1.24)], increased postoperative drainage [OR\u2009=\u20092.24, 95%CI (1.24, 4.83)], body \nmass index\u2009\u2264\u200918.5 [OR\u2009=\u20091.10, 95%CI (1.02, 1.20)], preoperative anemia \n[OR\u2009=\u20091.82, 95%CI (1.62, 2.03)], age\u2009\u2265\u200980 [OR\u2009=\u20091.49 95%CI(1.21, 1.83)], female \n[OR\u2009=\u20091.92, 95%CI (1.71, 2.15)], ASA class\u2009\u2265\u20093 [OR\u2009=\u20092.06, 95%CI (1.63, 2.61)] \nin patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) increases the incidence of \nperioperative blood transfusion.\nCONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that increased \nintraoperative bleeding, increased postoperative drainage, low body mass index \n(\u2264\u200918.5), preoperative anemia, advanced age (\u2265\u200980\u00a0years), female gender, and \nhigh ASA classification (\u2265\u20093) were significantly associated with the likelihood \nof needing blood transfusion.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "anemia", "text": "BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a well-established treatment for \nchronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF). While studies have demonstrated \nbenefits for mortality, hospitalization rates, and health related quality of \nlife (HRQL), evidence is particularly sparse regarding HRQL determinants in the \nolder population.\nMETHODS: In a prospective, monocentric observational study, HRQL was assessed \nusing the established Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI). The \nstudy was prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on 17 \nJune 2015 under the registration number DRKS00008759. Patients were categorized \ninto two age-based groups: older patients (\u2265\u200965 years) and younger patients \n(<\u200965 years). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze factors \non HRQL, including SRI scores, anemia, autonomy impairment, exacerbation history \nand other factors.\nRESULTS: 237 Patients with COPD with CHRF receiving NIV therapy were included. \nThe mean SRI summary score was 49.9\u2009\u00b1\u200916.8. with 23.2% (N\u2009=\u200955) suffering from \nanemia and 36.7% (N\u2009=\u200987) experiencing\u2009\u2265\u20092 exacerbations annually. Autonomy \nimpairment was observed in 49.4% (N\u2009=\u2009117) of patients. The updated Charlson \nComorbidity Index (uCCI) was 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.86. No significant differences were found \nin SRI Summary Scale scores between age groups (p\u2009=\u20090.581), but notable \ndisparities were present in the uCCI (p\u2009=\u20090.014). Multiple regression analysis \nrevealed a negative association of exacerbation history (Young group: -9.2; 95% \nCI = -14.8/ -3.55 vs. Older group: -6.17; 95% CI = -11.91/ -0.43) and level of \nautonomy impairment (e.g. Level of Care 2 Young group: -13.91; 95% CI = -21.4/ \n-6.43 vs. Older group: -14.94; 95% CI = -22.64/ -7.24) on SRI scores with \nage-related differences. Anemia only had a negative association on the SRI \nscores in younger patients with COPD (Young group: -7.9; 95% CI = -14.0/ -1.75 \nvs. Older group: -1.78; 95% CI = -9.21/ 5.65).\nDISCUSSION: Frequent exacerbations and a higher level of autonomy impairment had \na negative association on HRQL across all ages. However only higher levels of \nimpairment (\u2265\u20092) have a detrimental impact on older patients. Anemia was a \nnegative HRQL factor in younger patients, where it was more prevalent. Overall, \nHRQL was found to be comparably favorable in both older and younger patients, \ndespite age-specific differences in influencing factors.\nREGISTRATION OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL: The study from which the data were analyzed \nwas prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register \n(DRKS00008759) on June 17, 2015."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "anemia", "text": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a lifelong immune-mediated systemic disease \nthat develops in genetically predisposed subjects who show intolerance to gluten \nproteins. Intestinal wall inflammation with villi atrophy results in \nmalabsorption of nutrients and leads to several gastrointestinal and systemic \nsymptoms. High serum levels of anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase \nautoantibodies can be revealed in patients with CD. The aim of the study was to \nevaluate the presence of IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 complement deposits in the oral \nmucosa and its condition in CD patients.\nMETHODS: Thirty CD patients underwent complete clinical examination followed by \nmycologic evaluation, of whom 10 additionally had oral mucosa biopsy. Direct \nimmunofluorescence (DIF) was performed on the oral mucosa specimens using \npolyclonal rabbit IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 antibodies. The results were \nstatistically analyzed.\nRESULTS: The most common complaints included pain due to oral ulcers, \nxerostomia, and gingival bleeding. Frequently observed comorbidities were \nanemia, allergy, and thyroid disorders. Common oral mucosal findings included \nwhite-coated tongue, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis. Candidiasis was \nrevealed in 13 subjects (43.3%). IgA, IgG, IgM, or C3 deposits in the oral \nmucosa specimens were shown in none of the patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease may increase the frequency of white-coated tongue, \nlinea alba, and atrophic glossitis and may promote the development of oral \ncandidiasis. However, there are no evident markers in the CD patients' \nimmunopathologic examination of the oral mucosa specimens."}

Lurbinectedin has been \napproved for the post-platinum setting, but there is a lack of real-world \nevidence and information related to its optimal sequencing and effectiveness \nacross different lines of therapy. This study aimed to analyze line-dependent \noutcomes and response patterns of lurbinectedin in SCLC patients.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective multi-center study analysis, we enrolled SCLC \npatients treated with lurbinectedin between January 2020 and December 2024. \nPatient demographics, treatment histories, and outcomes were collected from \nelectronic medical records. Response assessment was performed using RECIST v1.1 \ncriteria. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment duration \nwere analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology, with specific attention to \noutcomes across different lines of therapy.\nRESULTS: A total of 64 patients were enrolled, with 59 evaluable for analysis \n(36 males [56.3\u00a0%], median age 65\u00a0years [range 37-81]). Lurbinectedin was given \nas second-line therapy in 39 patients (66.1\u00a0%) and as third-line or beyond in 20 \npatients (33.9\u00a0%). The overall response rate (ORR) was 37.3\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a022), \nincluding 1 complete response (1.7\u00a0%) and 21 partial responses (35.6\u00a0%). By line \nof therapy, the ORR was 38.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a015) in second-line and 35.0\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a07) in \nthird-line or later. The median overall survival (mOS) for all evaluable \npatients was 7.7\u00a0months, and the median duration of treatment (mDoT) was \n4.3\u00a0months. At data cutoff, 13 patients (22\u00a0%) were alive and censored in the OS \nanalysis, with a median follow-up of 8.5\u00a0months among survivors. Prior immune \ncheckpoint inhibitor (IO) exposure was documented in 71.9\u00a0% of patients \n(n\u00a0=\u00a046); although those with prior IO had numerically longer mOS (8.8 vs. \n6.0\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) and mDoT (4.6 vs. 2.3\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.14), neither \ndifference reached statistical significance. This survival analysis included 43 \npatients in the prior-IO group (3 patients with prior IO were excluded due to \nincomplete follow-up) and 16 patients in the no-IO group. The presence of \nbaseline brain metastases (47\u00a0%) did not preclude clinical benefit. Treatment \nwas generally well tolerated: the most common hematologic toxicities observed \nwere anemia (44.1\u00a0%), thrombocytopenia (37.3\u00a0%), and neutropenia (15.3\u00a0%), \npredominantly grade 1-2, and no grade 4 adverse events were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lurbinectedin demonstrated meaningful clinical activity in \nsecond-line therapy for SCLC, while also showing durable responses in heavily \npretreated cases. These findings support the consideration of lurbinectedin also \nbeyond second-line therapy in selected SCLC patients, though larger prospective \nstudies are needed to validate these response patterns."}

Patients with other complications such as \ninfections or acute chest syndrome were excluded. Data on patient demographics, \nED visit frequency, length of stay, and medications administered were collected.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the duration and frequency of \nED visits and the types and frequency of analgesics administered.\nSAMPLE SIZE: The study included 421 patients accounting for 20 508 ED visits.\nRESULTS: The average length of stay per ED visit was 4.7 hours. Morphine was the \nmost frequently used opioid, administered to 86% of patients, while paracetamol \nwas the most commonly used analgesic overall (93%). Regional differences were \nobserved, with less opioid use in the Eastern region, where the disease is less \nsevere due to haplotype variations. Ketamine was used in 13% of cases, \npredominantly in the Western region.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study highlights a diverse approach to AVOC management across \nSaudi Arabia, with variations influenced by regional differences and physician \npractices. Paracetamol and morphine were the primary analgesics, though \ndisparities in opioid use suggest the need for standardized pain management \nprotocols.\nLIMITATIONS: This study was limited to centers under one organization and \nexcluded patients with coexisting conditions, which may limit generalizability."}

Cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are essential for steroidogenesis in \nadrenals and gonads, have heme in their active center. CPOX encodes an enzyme \ncoproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) that is involved in the synthesis of heme.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to report the identification of biallelic \ninactivating CPOX variants in three unrelated patients with PAI and their \nclinical characteristics.\nMETHODS: We reported three patients with childhood-onset PAI, including two \npatients with 46,XY DSD. All three had adrenal hypoplasia. Additionally, they \ncommonly had severe neonatal jaundice; two of them developed skin blisters in \nthe areas exposed to phototherapy, and two showed severe neonatal anemia \nrequiring transfusions. Exome sequencing was performed to explore the genetic \nbasis of the patients. The pathogenicity of the identified variants was \nconfirmed with targeted mRNA and proteomic analyses of the patient-derived \nperipheral blood cells.\nRESULTS: We identified biallelic rare CPOX variants in each patient, including \nc.2T>G, p.Arg426*, c.1277G>A and p.Tyr429Cysfs33*. The three patients commonly \nhad the start codon-altering c.2T>G variant. Analysis of the mRNA and proteome \nof peripheral blood cells from one patient (c.2T>G and p.Arg426*) showed that \nCPOX mRNA expression was comparable to controls, however CPOX protein expression \nwas significantly decreased to 1%.\nCONCLUSION: We provided genetic evidence linking CPOX deficiency and PAI with \n46,XY DSD, suggesting that the heme synthesis pathway plays an important role in \nhuman steroidogenesis."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "myocardial infarction", "text": "BACKGROUND: Acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are associated with increased \nmorbidity and earlier mortality for people living with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). \nThe most common causes of PEx in CF are by bacterial infection and concomitant \ninflammation leading to progressive airway damage. To draw attention to the \nseriousness of PEx they have been labelled as 'lung attacks', much like a 'heart \nattack' for acute myocardial infarction. Treatment typically starts when a pwCF \npresents with worsening respiratory symptoms. Hence, there is a pressing need to \nidentify indicative biomarkers of PEx onset to allow more timely intervention. \nSet within an ecological framework, we investigated temporal microbiota dynamics \nto connect changes in the lung microbiota of pwCF to changes in disease states \nacross a PEx event.\nRESULTS: Species-time relationships (STR) describe how the richness of a \ncommunity changes with time, here STRs were used to assess temporal turnover (w) \nwithin the lung microbiota of each pwCF (n\u2009=\u200912, mean sample duration \n315.9\u2009\u00b1\u200942.7\u00a0days). STRs were characterised by high interpatient variability, \nindicating that turnover and hence temporal organization are a personalized \nfeature of the CF lung microbiota. Greater turnover was found to be \nsignificantly associated with greater change in lung function with time. When \nmicrobiota turnover was examined at a finer scale across each pwCF time series, \nw-values could clearly be observed to increase in the exacerbation period, then \npeaking within the treatment period, demonstrating that increases in turnover \nwere not solely a result of perturbations caused by PEx antibiotic \ninterventions. STR w-values have been found to have a remarkable degree of \nsimilarity for different organisms, in a variety of habitats and ecosystems, and \ntime lengths (typically not exceeding w\u2009=\u20090.5). Here, we found w-values soon \nincreased beyond that. It was therefore possible to use the departure from that \nexpected norm up to start of treatment to approximate onset of PEx in days \n(21.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u00a0days across the study participants).\nCONCLUSIONS: Here, we illustrate that changes in turnover of the lung microbiota \nof pwCF can be indicative of PEx onset in considerable advance of when treatment \nwould normally be initiated. This offers translational potential to enable early \ndetection of PEx and consequent timely intervention. Video Abstract."}

While prolonged door-to-balloon (DTB) \ntimes, reflecting delayed reperfusion, are a critical factor in STEMI outcomes, \nthey alone do not fully capture the observed outcome variability in diabetic \nwomen. Using an integrated clinical and pre-clinical approach this study aimed \nto investigate the relative contributions of metabolic dysfunction and coronary \nartery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) to STEMI outcomes in women, beyond \nthe impact of DTB time.\nMETHODS: A retrospective case-control study analysed female STEMI patients \nundergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI, n\u2009=\u200940 T2D, n\u2009=\u200940 \nnon-diabetic controls), comparing clinical characteristics, treatment \nstrategies, and early outcomes. A preclinical model (female db/db mice) assessed \ncardiac function via echocardiography, Langendorff perfusions, and \nischemia-reperfusion protocols. Metabolome of heart, liver, and skeletal muscle \nwas assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: Our study reveals significantly higher mortality, impaired left \nventricular function post-pPCI, and increased implantable \ncardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation rates in diabetic STEMI patients, \nirrespective of DTB time, when compared to non-diabetic controls. Elevated \ninflammatory markers, acute hyperglycaemia and evidence of cardio-hepatic damage \nwere identified in T2D patients. db/db mice exhibited analogous T2D-associated \npathophysiology, including increased ischemia-reperfusion injury exacerbated by \nmetabolic disturbances in the myocardium, liver, and skeletal muscle versus \nnon-diabetic controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: In diabetic women, multiple factors beyond reperfusion delays \nexacerbate acute myocardial injury. This necessitates the development of \nsex-specific strategies to manage the cardiovascular complications of diabetic \nHFpEF. The db/db mouse model provides a relevant preclinical tool for future \nresearch as it mimics human T2D-associated HFpEF and STEMI outcome."}

Participants who underwent \nfollow-up health examinations between 2011 and 2014 (N=2,728,675) were \nadditionally categorized by the combination of baseline and follow-up CVH \nscores.\nOUTCOME: A composite of a cardiovascular or kidney event. Cardiovascular events \nincluded myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and death from \nCVD.

Multivariable-adjusted risk of the \nevent decreased stepwise with higher CVH scores (for a CVH score of 6 vs. 0: HR \n0.32 [95% CI, 0.30-0.34]). An increase in CVH score from baseline (2009-2010) to \nfollow-up (2011-2014) examination was associated with lower risk of an event (HR \n0.86 [95% CI, 0.86-0.87] per +1 CVH score change).

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "myocardial infarction", "text": "The protein IkappaB-Zeta (I\u03baB\u03b6), which is a member of the IkappaB (I\u03baB) family, \nhas been implicated in the onset and progression of immune-mediated inflammation \nand cancer. However, its role in cardiovascular disease remains totally \nunexplored. We employed advanced molecular techniques to investigate the \nupregulation of I\u03baB\u03b6 protein in mouse models of acute myocardial infarction \n(AMI) and cellular oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), with a focus on nuclear \nlocalization. Our results indicate that inhibiting I\u03baB\u03b6 protein expression both \nin vivo and in vitro can reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and alleviate cardiac \nhypoxic injury. Mechanistically, I\u03baB\u03b6 influences cardiomyocyte apoptosis by \nbinding to and regulating the activity of the intracellular signal transduction \nfactor and transcriptional activator (STAT3). Upon AMI occurrence, the janus \nkinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) \nsignaling pathway is activated, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and its \nsubsequent translocation into the nucleus. It interacts with activated I\u03baB\u03b6 in \nthe nucleus, resulting in decreased STAT3 activity and exacerbating \ncardiomyocyte apoptosis. Treatment with a STAT3-specific agonist mitigated the \npro-apoptotic effects caused by I\u03baB\u03b6 overexpression. In conclusion, our study \ndescribes for the first time the molecular link in I\u03baB\u03b6 and STAT3 and reveals \nthat pro-apoptotic I\u03baB\u03b6 plays a crucial role in AMI pathogenesis by \ndownregulating STAT3 activity. These findings suggest that targeting I\u03baB\u03b6 may \nprovide a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the \nprevention and treatment of myocardial infarction."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "myocardial infarction", "text": "Directional Coronary Atherectomy (DCA) is a potential treatment option for left \nmain (LM) bifurcation lesions, as it may prevent side branch occlusion and \nreduce the need for complex stenting. Recent studies have suggested that \ncombining drug-coated balloon (DCB) with DCA can lead to favorable \ncardiovascular outcomes. However, the comparative efficacy of DCB and current \ndrug-eluting stents (DES) following DCA for LM bifurcation lesions remains \nunclear. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DCB and DES \nfollowing DCA for LM bifurcation lesions. A retrospective analysis was conducted \non 109 patients treated with DCA for LM bifurcation lesions from 2016 to 2024. \nPatients were divided into groups of DCA+DCB (n=58) and DCA+DES (n=51). The \nprimary endpoint was ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR), \nand the secondary endpoint was target lesion-related myocardial infarction \n(TLMI). Lesion characteristics were evaluated using quantitative coronary \nangiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Kaplan-Meier analysis \nrevealed higher ID-TLR occurrence at 5 years in the DCA+DCB group than the \nDCA+DES group (16.4% vs. 2.3%, P=0.027). In contrast, TLMI occurrence was \nsimilar (4.7% vs. 2.3%, P=0.667). The DCA+DCB group exhibited greater residual \ndiameter stenosis (24.4% vs. 16.3%, P<0.001) on QCA and smaller minimum lumen \narea (7.33 mm\u00b2 vs. 8.42 mm\u00b2, P<0.001) and greater residual plaque area (48.9% \nvs. 45.3%, P=0.027) on IVUS compared to the DCA+DES group. In conclusion, the \nDCA+DCB strategy was associated with a higher ID-TLR incidence and a smaller \nluminal gain than DCA+DES.

MFS and BH segmentation and radiomics feature extraction and \nselection were performed on VMIs images, and four machine learning classifiers \nwere constructed using selected strongest features. Subsequently, an independent \nvalidation was conducted, and a subjective diagnosis of the validation set was \nprovided by an radiologist. The AUC was used to assess the performance of the \nradiomics models.\nRESULT: The training set included 57 patients from center 1 (mean age, 54\u202fyears \n+/- 9, 55 men), and the external validation set included 10 patients from center \n2 (mean age, 59\u202fyears +/- 10, 9 men). The radiomics models exhibited the highest \nAUC value of 0.937 (expressed at 130\u202fkeV VMIs), while the radiologist \ndemonstrated the highest AUC value of 0.734 (expressed at 40\u202fkeV VMIs).\nCONCLUSION: The integration of radiomic features derived from VMIs of DECCTA \nwith machine learning algorithms has the potential to improve the efficiency of \ndistinguishing MFS from BH."}

We screened a 12-month period of our local thrombectomy database as \na preliminary investigation into additional signs that can be gleaned to aid M2 \nocclusion diagnosis when imaged using this technique.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the CTA and digital subtraction angiographic (DSA) imaging \nin 10 consecutive patients with M2 MCA occlusions who subsequently underwent \nthrombectomy.\nRESULTS: All patients showed the presence of hyperattenuating M3 and M4 vessels \ndistal to the occlusion on delayed-phase but not early-phase CTA (despite venous \nopacification evident on the latter). Compared to the contralateral side, \nattenuation values were significantly elevated in these vessels (202.3 [23.9] \nvs. 108.5 [16.4] Hounsfield units [HU]; 95% confidence interval [CI] of \ndifference: 69.7-117.9, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Eight of 10 patients also showed associated \nipsilateral hyperattenuating cortical veins; the attenuation difference compared \nto contralateral cortical veins was 263.5 (58.3) vs. 151 (16.7) HU, 95% CI: \n69.0-156.0, p = 0.0005. Collateral appearance and washout were much brisker on \nDSA suggesting that the signs on delayed-phase CTA represent the retrograde \naccumulation of contrast material distal to the occlusion after multiple \ncontrast passes with slowed resultant venous flow accounting for an accumulation \non the venous side.\nCONCLUSION: An additional phase at 40-s displays hyperattenuating distal \narteries and cortical veins that could aid in occlusion detection."}

Descriptive statistics summarized \ndemographics, AI tool usage, access, and integration. Two-proportion Z-tests \nassessed differences across institutional types.\nRESULTS: Most respondents (97.9%) reported AI tool use, primarily Viz AI and \nRapid AI, but only 62.1% consistently used them for triage prior to radiologist \ninterpretation. Just 37.5% reported formal protocol integration, and 43.6% had \ndesignated personnel for AI alert response.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine \nthe extent to which EIHS increased proteolysis and altered calcium homeostasis \nin the left (LV) and right ventricles (RV).

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "stroke", "text": "BACKGROUND: Proprioceptive impairments of the upper limb are common after \nstroke. These impairments are not typically addressed during assessment or \nrehabilitation. Currently, most robotic paradigms for training of the upper limb \nhave focused solely on improving motor function or have targeted proprioception \nin individuals with combined use of visual feedback. Our goal was to design a \ntraining paradigm that directly targets proprioception of the upper limb, while \nminimizing reliance on other sensory information to improve sensorimotor \nfunction after stroke.\nMETHODS: In this pilot study, 5 individuals with stroke and 5 age-matched \ncontrols were tested on a single-day proprioceptive training paradigm. Here, \nparticipants used a joystick with their less-affected arm to send commands to a \nKINARM exoskeleton that would passively move their more-affected arm. To \ncomplete the passive reaching task, participants relied only on proprioceptive \nfeedback from the more-affected arm and were only given knowledge of results \ninformation after each trial. Sensorimotor function of the upper limb was \nmeasured pre- and post-training via robotic measures of motor function [Visually \nGuided Reaching (VGR)] and position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)]. \nSensorimotor function was quantified as a Task Score, which incorporated \nmultiple task-relevant parameters for both VGR and APM. Changes in sensorimotor \nperformance due to training were calculated as the pre- to post-training \ndifference for VGR and APM within the control and stroke groups.\nRESULTS: We found significant improvements from pre-training to post-training \nfor VGR in individuals with stroke (p\u2009<\u20090.001, CLES\u2009=\u2009100) that were not \nobserved in control participants (p\u2009=\u20090.87, CLES\u2009=\u200980). We observed significant \nchanges from pre- to post-training in both VGR (Posture Speed, Reaction Time, \nInitial Direction Angle, Min-Max Speed Difference, and Movement Time) and APM \n(Contraction/Expansion Ratiox and Shifty) parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel proprioceptive training paradigm is one of the first to \nimplement a self-guided sensory training protocol. We observed improvements in \nmotor function and proprioception for individuals with stroke. This pilot study \ndemonstrates the feasibility of self-guided proprioceptive training to improve \nmotor and sensory function in individuals with stroke. Future studies aim to \nexamine multi-day training to examine longer-term impacts on upper limb \nsensorimotor function."}

A preclinical model (female db/db mice) assessed \ncardiac function via echocardiography, Langendorff perfusions, and \nischemia-reperfusion protocols. Metabolome of heart, liver, and skeletal muscle \nwas assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: Our study reveals significantly higher mortality, impaired left \nventricular function post-pPCI, and increased implantable \ncardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation rates in diabetic STEMI patients, \nirrespective of DTB time, when compared to non-diabetic controls. Elevated \ninflammatory markers, acute hyperglycaemia and evidence of cardio-hepatic damage \nwere identified in T2D patients. db/db mice exhibited analogous T2D-associated \npathophysiology, including increased ischemia-reperfusion injury exacerbated by \nmetabolic disturbances in the myocardium, liver, and skeletal muscle versus \nnon-diabetic controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: In diabetic women, multiple factors beyond reperfusion delays \nexacerbate acute myocardial injury. This necessitates the development of \nsex-specific strategies to manage the cardiovascular complications of diabetic \nHFpEF. The db/db mouse model provides a relevant preclinical tool for future \nresearch as it mimics human T2D-associated HFpEF and STEMI outcome."}

Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left \natrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains \nduring the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we \ninvestigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN \ngroup were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the \nfirst occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive \nheart failure, or cardiac death.\nRESULTS: (1) Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant \ndifferences in echocardiographic data for left ventricular size or function \nacross groups. (2) Correlation analysis after multivariable adjustment revealed \nthat the LA minimal volume index (LAVImin) increased with the progression of DN, \nwhile the absolute value of the LA strain index(reservoir and conduit period) \ndecreased as renal damage worsened, exhibiting a highly significant correlation \nwith the GFR (P\u2009<\u20090.01). (3) Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses \nrevealed that: LAVmin, LASr, GFR, and HbA1c were associated with MACEs in \npatients with DN. Incorporating LAVmin and LASr into the basic model \nsignificantly enhanced the predictive value for MACEs in DN patients (with an \narea under the curve (AUC) of 0.818, sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of \n85.4%).\nCONCLUSION: The increase in LA volume and weakened reservoir and conduit \nfunction in T2DM patients dynamically reflect the severity of renal damage. \nLAVImin and LASr are associated with the occurrence of MACEs in asymptomatic \ntype 2 diabetes patients with early renal damage.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."}

The objective of this research was to explore the \nroles and underlying mechanisms of the circDnajc1/miR-27a-5p/C1qc signaling \npathway in the development of ischemia stroke. For in vitro experiments, an \noxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model was established \nfollowing neuron-microglia co-culture. circDnajc1 siRNA and pcDNA3.1-circDnajc1 \noverexpression vectors were constructed and transfected into primary microglia. \nFor in vivo experiments, an MCAO/R rat model was established. The molecular \nmechanisms were investigated using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, \nRNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro \nexperiments showed that circDnajc1-induced cellular activation following \nmicroglia OGD/R injury, promoted the release of inflammatory factors, \ndownregulated miR-27a-5p, upregulated C1qc, C3, and C5ar, and promotes neuronal \napoptosis after microglia OGD/R injury. Interference with circDnajc1 reversed \nthese effects. In vivo experiments, circDnajc1 knockdown exerted a protective \neffect on neurons in MCAO/R rats and inhibited microglial activation and the \nrelease of inflammatory factors. Consistent with the in vitro experiments, \ncircDnajc1 regulated on the expression of downstream target genes of miR-27a-5p, \nC1qc, C3, and C5ar. CircDnajc1 plays a critical role in ischemia stroke and may \ninfluence nervous system homeostasis by regulating the \ncircDnajc1/miR-27a-5p/C1qc signaling axis, which promotes microglia activation \nand regulates inflammatory factor release and neuronal apoptosis."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "stroke", "text": "BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor, is widely used for \nstroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of \ndeep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Compared with warfarin, edoxaban \noffers non-inferior thromboembolic protection with a lower risk of major \nbleeding. However, with the increasing clinical use of edoxaban, reports of \nserious adverse events (AEs) have emerged, necessitating a comprehensive safety \nassessment.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of 6 databases was \nconducted until December 2024. Case reports of serious AEs were included. Data \nextraction was performed using a structured Excel-based data collection form. \nDescriptive statistical analyses were performed to summarize the characteristics \nof the cases.\nRESULTS: 41 cases of serious AEs met the inclusion criteria. 26 involved severe \nbleeding events, whereas 2 cases involved thrombotic events. 7 patients had \nmedication errors. P-glycoprotein inhibitors were co-administered in 9 cases, \ncontributing to increased bleeding risk, while P-gp inducers were used in 2 \ncases, potentially reducing edoxaban efficacy. The median time to AE onset was \nwithin one month in 18 cases, but 1 case occurred after four years of therapy. 6 \npatients died, of whom 4 deaths were attributed to AEs.\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the clinical risks associated with edoxaban, \nparticularly in elderly patients, those with impaired renal function, and those \nreceiving concomitant P-gp inhibitors. In addition to confirming previously \nknown risk factors, this study provides practical prescribing insights by \nsynthesizing real-world evidence on medication errors, inappropriate \nco-administration, and off-label use. These findings are of direct relevance to \nprescribers and underscore the importance of individualized risk assessment and \ncontinuous pharmacovigilance."}

Retention, responder (\u2265\u200950% \nseizure reduction) rates, seizure-free rates and adverse events (AEs) were \nanalyzed. Sub-analyses examined early (\u2264\u20091 previous ASM) vs. late (>\u20092 previous \nASMs) add-on groups.\nRESULTS: The sample included 485 patients with focal and generalized epilepsy: \n354 with\u2009<\u20095 seizures/month, 79 with 5-20, and 52 with\u2009>\u200920 seizures/month. \nRetention rates at 12\u00a0months were 75.1%, 68%, and 58.1.7%, respectively. \nPerampanel significantly reduced seizure frequency in all groups, with responder \nrates of 71.2%, 61.8%, and 63.2% at the 12-month follow-up. Patients with more \nfrequent seizures (>\u200920 and 5-20 seizures/month) had lower seizure-free rates \n(15.8% and 23.5%) compared to those with\u2009<\u20095 seizures/month (49.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). \nAEs, mainly dizziness and irritability occurred in 30% of patients, without \nsignificant differences between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.092).\nCONCLUSIONS: PER, as the sole adjunctive therapy, demonstrated good \neffectiveness and tolerability in a real-world setting, even for patients with \nhighly active epilepsy.

Drugs were administered orally for 90\u202fdays. Mating was \nsynchronized with estrous cycles, and implantation sites were assessed \nhistologically using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry was \nperformed to evaluate expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), \nE-cadherin, and transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), quantified by \nH-score analysis.\nKEY FINDINGS: Expression levels of LIF, E-cadherin, and FOXO1 were significantly \nlower in all treatment groups compared to controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Tukey's post hoc \nanalysis revealed significant differences in LIF and E-cadherin among most \ngroups (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). No significant differences in FOXO1 expression were observed \nbetween ZNS vs. CLB (p\u202f=\u202f0.152) or ZNS vs. LCM (p\u202f=\u202f0.070), while all other \ncomparisons were significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The most pronounced reduction in \nimplantation markers was found in the LCM group.\nSIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that long-term administration of ZNS, OXC, \nCLB, and LCM may impair implantation by altering key molecular markers. The \nfindings highlight potential reproductive risks associated with chronic \nantiepileptic drug exposure during adolescence."}

Studies on comprehensive endocrinological evaluation of adrenocortical \nfunction following low-dose ACTH therapy without tapering are limited.\nMETHODS: We collected the data of patients who were diagnosed with IESS and \nreceived ACTH therapy using synthetic ACTH at 0.005-0.0125\u00a0mg/kg/day (equivalent \nto natural ACTH at 0.2-0.5\u00a0IU/kg/day) for 14\u00a0days without tapering, and \nunderwent an ACTH stimulation test following ACTH therapy completion for \nadrenocortical function evaluation. Moreover, body weight, blood pressure, and \nelectrolytes were measured before and after treatment.\nRESULTS: A total of 11 patients, aged between 3\u00a0months and 1\u00a0year and 6\u00a0months, \nwere enrolled. ACTH therapy was effective in all 11 patients. During the \nobservation period, 3 patients developed seizure recurrence; however, none of \nthe patients exhibited symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. The ACTH stimulation \ntest confirmed normal adrenocortical function in all cases, with peak cortisol \nlevels exceeding 20\u00a0\u03bcg/dL. After treatment, a significant increase in body \nweight and blood pressure were observed.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose ACTH therapy without tapering can be endocrinologically \nsafe. The result provides useful information for reducing hospitalization \nduration and minimizing side effects. To validate these findings, further \nstudies with larger cohorts are needed."}

We present a multimodal approach \nintegrating intraoperative thalamic and sub-scalp electroencephalogram \nrecordings with post-implant reconstructions to define neural targets affected \nby centromedian nucleus stimulation. We find that stimulating low-activity \nregions near the centromedian nucleus, particularly the white matter of internal \nmedullary lamina, induces significant cortical delta power increases greater \nthan stimulation within high-activity areas inside the nucleus. Implantation in \nthese low-activity targets results in greater than 50% seizure reduction in all \nthree subjects.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "glaucoma", "text": "The desire for permanent cosmetic change of eye color has driven the development \nof various surgical techniques aimed at achieving this transformation, pursuing \nmore enduring solutions. This demand has led to the emergence of three primary \nsurgical approaches: cosmetic iris implants, laser iris depigmentation, and \ncosmetic keratopigmentation (KTP). Each technique presents distinct advantages, \nyet also entails specific limitations and potential risks. Cosmetic iris \nimplants, originally designed for congenital or traumatic iris defects, have \nbeen repurposed for aesthetic use. However, they come with severe risks, \nincluding glaucoma, corneal endothelial cell loss, and even permanent vision \nimpairment. As a result of these complications, they are not approved by major \nregulatory bodies and are widely considered unsafe. Laser iris depigmentation \noffers a less invasive approach, using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser to remove \nmelanin from the anterior iris stroma. While it provides a natural-looking \nresult, it lacks customization and has potential complications like patchy \npigmentation, photophobia, and temporary intraocular pressure spikes. \nAdditionally, there is limited long-term data on its safety. Cosmetic KTP, an \nadvanced version of corneal tattooing, has emerged as the safest and most \neffective option. It involves embedding micronized mineral pigments into the \ncornea, allowing for precise, customizable, and long-lasting results. Studies \nshow high patient satisfaction and minimal risks when properly performed. Among \nthese techniques, KTP appears to be the best choice owing to its safety and \naesthetic flexibility, while cosmetic iris implants should be avoided because of \ntheir high risk of complications, and laser iris depigmentation deals with \nlimitations in color selection and long-term reliability. While KTP currently \nseems the safest option for cosmetic eye color change, this is largely based on \nlimited single-center data and should be confirmed by larger studies in the \nfuture."}

The primary risk factor for POAG is elevated intraocular \npressure (IOP), which is primarily driven by increased resistance to aqueous \nhumor outflow through the conventional outflow pathway. Despite its prevalence, \nthe precise biomechanical mechanisms underlying this resistance remain unclear. \nIn this study, we utilized 3D in situ traction force microscopy to investigate \nthe effects of the rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 and the YAP/TAZ inhibitor \nVerteporfin treatments on the trabecular meshwork (TM) and juxtacanalicular \ntissue (JCT) cellular contractility and their extracellular matrix (ECM) \nreorganization in both normal and glaucomatous human donor eyes. Our analysis \nrevealed dysregulated traction forces within glaucomatous tissues, leading to \nsignificant ECM reorganization that may contribute to disrupting the homeostasis \nof the aqueous outflow pathway. Treatments appear to help restore normal ECM \nstructure by adjusting cellular forces. The effect on contractile forces \ndiffered between genders, suggesting the significance of gender in treatment \nresponse. Our results suggest that targeting these biomechanical pathways may \noffer new therapeutic strategies to reduce outflow resistance, laying the \ngroundwork for future therapies aimed at preserving vision by restoring ECM \nbiomechanics and improving outflow."}

The diagnosis and management of POAG \ninvolves tests such as static perimetry, tonometry and optical coherence \ntomography (OCT) to track progressive structural and functional changes. All \nthese methods have limitations. Advancements in the discovery of metabolomic \nplasma-derived biomarkers may improve clinical outcomes, through identifying \nsusceptible individuals, predicting disease progression, and assessing treatment \nefficacy in POAG.\nAREAS COVERED: We reviewed the current state of POAG management, identified \nlimitations and need for biomarkers that could potentially fill the gap and \ncurrent landscape of POAG plasma metabolomics, providing an overview of future \npotential biomarkers.\nEXPERT OPINION: Advances in the identification of metabolomic biomarkers can \nimprove current clinical practices. These biomarkers can complement existing \ndiagnostic tools, allowing for earlier detection and personalized treatment \nstrategies. However, challenges remain, including a lack of standardization in \nmetabolomics protocols, variability in disease progression and finally, \nrecording treatment non-response currently also suffers from a lack of \nstandardization toward depicting treatment outcomes. Future research should \nfocus on standardizing procedures, increasing diversity in study populations, \nand conducting longitudinal studies to validate biomarkers in clinical settings."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "glaucoma", "text": "BACKGROUND: Glaucoma, an optic neuropathy, is the second leading cause of \nirreversible blindness worldwide. Wound healing efficiency and anti-oxidant \npotential of the small extracellular vesicles (sEV) isolated from the adult \ntissue-resident stem cells of the trabecular meshwork (TMSC) compared to \ntrabecular meshwork (TM) cells have been demonstrated. This study aimed to \ncompare the protein profile of extracellular vesicles derived from TMSCs and TM \ncells for a better understanding of their potential as a cell-free therapeutic \nagent for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Proteins were isolated from TM and TMSC sEV samples (n\u2009=\u20093 \neach) and proteomic profiling was carried out by mass spectrometry. Mass \nspectrometry analysis identified 2802 proteins in TMSC sEV and 2848 in TM sEV. \nDifferential expression analysis identified distinct protein profiles between \nTMSC and TM sEV. Notably, sEV from TMSCs were enriched with proteins associated \nwith wound healing, cell proliferation, migration, anti-oxidant, and \nanti-apoptotic activities, consistent with the findings in other mesenchymal \nstem cells. Pathway analysis highlighted the enrichment of proteins associated \nwith PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Further validation by western \nblotting confirmed that TMSC sEV effectively modulated these pathways in TM \ncells, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival under oxidative \nstress.\nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive protein profiling \nof TMSC-derived sEV, demonstrating the presence of functional proteins and their \ncapacity to regulate the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways in the recipient \nTM cells. This highlights the potential of TMSC sEV in advancing cell-free \ntherapeutic strategies for POAG in future."}

This study aimed to \ninvestigate conjunctival wound healing and its impact on scar formation and \ninflammatory responses in glaucoma patients after surgery.\nMETHODS: This study included 130 primary glaucoma patients who underwent \ntrabeculectomy from January 2022 to January 2024. After 4\u2009months of follow-up \n(with initial assessment at 14\u2009days), patients were categorized into a scarring \ngroup (n\u2009=\u200938) and a nonscarring group (n\u2009=\u200992). Scar markers, inflammatory \nfactors, and clinical data were analyzed. Pearson correlation and logistic \nregression analyses were conducted to explore the factors influencing scarring.\nRESULTS: Patients in the scarring group had greater preoperative intraocular \npressure, lens thickness, and postoperative bleb leakage (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The levels \nof TGF-\u03b2, PDGF, CTGF, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b1 were significantly greater in the \nscarring group (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Mean age at implantation was 34.13 \u00b1 9.51 years, with \npredominantly Asian ethnicity (53%) and male gender (60%).\nMETHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, \npre-explantation parameters, complications, management, and outcomes. \nBest-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), endothelial \ncell count (ECC), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were analyzed before and \nafter explantation. Secondary interventions were documented, and statistical \nanalyses were performed using paired t-tests and Pearson correlation \ncoefficients.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BCVA, IOP, ECC, CCT, presence of uveitis, glaucoma, \ncorneal decompensation, cataract formation, and need for secondary surgical \ninterventions.\nRESULTS: Median time to explantation was 45.5 months (range: 6.0-140.1 months). \nThe most common complications included uveitis (60%), elevated IOP requiring \nglaucoma surgery (33.3%), corneal decompensation requiring Descemet's Membrane \nEndothelial Keratoplasty (20%), and cataract formation requiring \nphacoemulsification (13.3%). A statistically significant positive correlation \nwas found between time to explantation and corneal decompensation (r\u202f=\u202f0.392, \np\u202f=\u202f0.048).

Aging also impacted \nbasement membrane (BM) and tight junction (TJ) morphology. The impact of OHT was \nmuch more evident in old mice; RGC loss was exacerbated, retinal vascular \nphenotypes were magnified across all three RCPs, and BM and TJ phenotypes were \nmuch more severe. However, the impact of OHT on retinal function was unchanged \nin old mice. Interestingly, the nature of these phenotypes was not equivalent \namong all RCPs, suggesting regional shared and distinct susceptibilities to \naging and OHT. Taken together, aging causes multiple neurovascular phenotypes in \nmouse retinas, and OHT causes more severe effects in old mice. This suggests an \ninteraction between aging and OHT that may help explain the increased prevalence \nof glaucoma in older humans."}

Frequently observed comorbidities were \nanemia, allergy, and thyroid disorders. Common oral mucosal findings included \nwhite-coated tongue, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis. Candidiasis was \nrevealed in 13 subjects (43.3%). IgA, IgG, IgM, or C3 deposits in the oral \nmucosa specimens were shown in none of the patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease may increase the frequency of white-coated tongue, \nlinea alba, and atrophic glossitis and may promote the development of oral \ncandidiasis. However, there are no evident markers in the CD patients' \nimmunopathologic examination of the oral mucosa specimens."}

The study also sought to provide new epidemiological evidence for \nthe association between endemic cretinism and lipid metabolism disorders, \nparticularly hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: All surviving endemic cretinism patients (n\u2009=\u200931) and \nmatched controls (n\u2009=\u200997) were investigated in December 2020. iodine \nconcentration in urinary and serum, thyroid function parameters, lipid profile \n[total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TRIG), low-density lipoprotein \ncholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)], fasting \nblood glucose (FBG), and blood pressure measurements [systolic blood pressure \n(SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] were assessed. Endemic cretinism patients \nexhibited significantly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and a \nhigher prevalence of hypothyroidism compared to controls. Serum TC and TRIG \nconcentrations were markedly higher in endemic cretinism patients than in \ncontrols (5.27 mmol/L vs. 4.73 mmol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.009; and 1.65 mmol/L vs. 1.04 \nmmol/L, P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and \nhypertriglyceridemia was significantly higher in endemic cretinism patients \n(P\u2009=\u20090.001 and P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that \nendemic cretinism was an independent risk factor for both hypercholesterolemia \n[adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\u2009=\u20092.870, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.129-7.298] \nand hypertriglyceridemia (AOR\u2009=\u20095.912, 95% CI: 2.261-15.455).\nCONCLUSION: Adult endemic cretinism patients demonstrate significantly elevated \nserum lipid levels and are more susceptible to hypercholesterolemia and \nhypertriglyceridemia, conditions closely associated with their underlying \nhypothyroidism. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring and \nmanaging metabolic parameters in adult endemic cretinism patients."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "thyroid disorder", "text": "BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder affecting \n1-2% of the population in iodine sufficient areas. While levothyroxine is \nstandard treatment, a substantial number of patients report persistent symptoms \ndespite adequate treatment. The use of liothyronine as an adjunct to \nlevothyroxine therapy has increased. The psychiatric characteristics of patients \nreceiving liothyronine remain largely unknown. This study examines the \nassociation between preexisting psychiatric morbidity and subsequent \nliothyronine use in autoimmune hypothyroidism.\nMETHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study includes all adults in \nSweden with autoimmune hypothyroidism and initiated on treatment with thyroid \nhormones between 2006 and 2020. Data were obtained from the National Patient \nRegister and the National Prescribed Drug Register. Psychiatric morbidity prior \nto diagnosis was identified using ICD-10 codes and ATC-codes for psychiatric \nmedications. Logistic models estimated associations, adjusting for sex, age, and \nregion.\nRESULTS: Among 353,708 patients, 44.8% had a history of psychiatric morbidity. \nThese patients were more likely to receive liothyronine (adjusted odds ratio \n(aOR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.83-1.97, p<0.001) compared to \nthose without a psychiatric history. This was most evident among individuals \nwith affective or anxiety morbidity (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.84-1.98, p<0.001). No \nassociation was found for psychotic morbidity (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98-1.19, \np=0.11).\nCONCLUSION: Patients with a psychiatric history before autoimmune hypothyroidism \nwere more likely to receive liothyronine, especially among those with affective \nor anxiety morbidity. This may reflect persistent symptoms and affect subsequent \ndecisions in the treatment of hypothyroidism."}

The purpose of this study was to investigate circulating \nleptin levels in thyroid dysfunction (TD) patients and the role of TH levels.\nMETHODS: The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of \nScience were independently searched by two researchers, from inception until \nFebruary 3, 2024, and updated on February 15, 2025. Pooled standardized mean \ndifference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by the \nrandom effects model.\nRESULTS: Thirty-eight studies reported circulating leptin levels in TD and \ncontrol with euthyroidism, 4295 subjects were included in total, of which 1277 \nwere hypothyroidism, 540 were hyperthyroidism, and 2478 were control. Compared \nto euthyroidism, leptin levels were significantly higher in hypothyroidism, and \nnot significantly altered in hyperthyroidism (SMD [95%CI]\u2009=\u20090.71 [0.38, 1.04] \nand -0.03 [-0.57, 0.51], respectively). The subgroup analysis indicated that, \ncompared to euthyroidism, leptin levels were significantly higher in subjects \nregardless of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism (SMD [95%CI]\u2009=\u20090.76 [0.25, \n1.26] and 0.41 [0.11, 0.70], respectively), and not significantly different in \novert hyperthyroidism (SMD [95%CI]\u2009=\u2009-0.14 [-0.74, 0.45]). Furthermore, when \ncompared to age-, gender-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched euthyroidism, \nleptin levels were significantly higher in hypothyroidism and had no significant \ndifference in hyperthyroidism (SMD [95%CI]\u2009=\u20090.66 [0.24, 1.07] and -0.43 [-1.13, \n0.27], respectively). A total of 16 studies analyzed the correlations between \nleptin levels and TH levels in TD, 488 were hypothyroidism and 206 were \nhyperthyroidism. Following correlation analysis, leptin levels displayed a \npositive correlation with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (r\u2009=\u20090.19) \nand a negative correlation with triiodothyronine (T3) levels (r\u2009=\u2009-0.40) in TD.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to euthyroidism, circulating leptin levels were \nsignificantly higher in hypothyroidism, and not significantly altered in \nhyperthyroidism. Besides, leptin levels in TD may be directly regulated by TSH \nand T3 levels, independent of BMI.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: CRD42024561055."}

We conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) and \ncolocalization analysis to determine plasma proteins causally associated with \nAITD. Proteome-wide summary-level genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were \ncollected from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) and deCODE \ngenetics, encompassing 2922 and 4719 plasma proteins, respectively.

MR analysis, including summary-data-based Mendelian \nrandomization (SMR), Wald Ratio, and IVW methods, was employed to estimate the \ncausal effects between plasma proteins and AITD. Colocalization analysis was \nused to assess whether identified proteins and AITD shared the common causal \nvariants.

Here we estimate the prevalence of \ntreated hyper- and hypo-thyroidism and assess the potential sociodemographic and \ngeographic disparities in France in 2020 given the country's poor \nepidemiological knowledge of these conditions. Methods We used the French \nnational health data system, which covers nearly the entire population residing \nin France (over 67 million inhabitants in metropolitan and overseas \ndepartments). Prevalent cases were identified based on patients' long-term \ndisease status, hospitalisation for hyper- and hypothyroidism and reimbursements \nfor thyroid hormones, antithyroid drugs, iodine-131 and thyroid surgery. Thyroid \nstimulating hormone, antithyroid antibodies and previous therapy for thyroid \ncancer and hyperthyroidism were considered to characterise the origin and \nsurveillance of hypothyroidism. Results In 2020, we identified 112,992 and \n2,986,333 cases of treated hyper- and hypothyroidism, respectively, with an \noverall prevalence of 0.17 and 4.45 per 100 inhabitants. Marked differences were \nobserved in terms of sex, age group and geographic area (department) for both \nconditions and deprivation level of the place of residence for hyperthyroidism \nonly. The proportion of hypothyroidism following previous therapy for thyroid \ncancer or hyperthyroidism was less than 10%. Adequate monitoring (thyroid \nstimulating hormone checked in the past year) occurred in 73.7% of hypothyroid \nsubjects, with large variations across departments. Conclusions This study \nprovides prevalence estimates of treated hyper- and hypothyroidism at the \nnational and departmental levels in France and improves epidemiological \nknowledge of both conditions. It also supports using health claims data for \ntheir epidemiological surveillance."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "gingivitis", "text": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a lifelong immune-mediated systemic disease \nthat develops in genetically predisposed subjects who show intolerance to gluten \nproteins. Intestinal wall inflammation with villi atrophy results in \nmalabsorption of nutrients and leads to several gastrointestinal and systemic \nsymptoms. High serum levels of anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase \nautoantibodies can be revealed in patients with CD. The aim of the study was to \nevaluate the presence of IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 complement deposits in the oral \nmucosa and its condition in CD patients.\nMETHODS: Thirty CD patients underwent complete clinical examination followed by \nmycologic evaluation, of whom 10 additionally had oral mucosa biopsy. Direct \nimmunofluorescence (DIF) was performed on the oral mucosa specimens using \npolyclonal rabbit IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 antibodies. The results were \nstatistically analyzed.\nRESULTS: The most common complaints included pain due to oral ulcers, \nxerostomia, and gingival bleeding. Frequently observed comorbidities were \nanemia, allergy, and thyroid disorders. Common oral mucosal findings included \nwhite-coated tongue, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis. Candidiasis was \nrevealed in 13 subjects (43.3%). IgA, IgG, IgM, or C3 deposits in the oral \nmucosa specimens were shown in none of the patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease may increase the frequency of white-coated tongue, \nlinea alba, and atrophic glossitis and may promote the development of oral \ncandidiasis. However, there are no evident markers in the CD patients' \nimmunopathologic examination of the oral mucosa specimens."}

Group ALF \nreceived long implants following alveolar ridge augmentation to support fixed \nrestorations. Group SF received short implants to support fixed restorations. \nGroup OVD received two long implants to support a removable partial denture. The \nplaque index (MPI), gingival index (MGI), Pocket depth (PD), implant stability \n(IS), and crestal bone loss (CBL) were assessed: immediately after the \nprosthesis insertion (T0), six months (T6), and twelve months (T12) later. All \ngroups were assessed for patient satisfaction after 12 months using a visual \nanalogue scale (VAS) survey.\nRESULTS: Implant survival rates were 89.7%, 91.7%, and 85% in the ALF, SF, and \nOVD groups (Chi-square\u2009=\u20090.972, log-rank test, p\u2009=.673). The ALF and SF groups \nhad significantly greater plaque and gingival scores (P\u2009<.05) than the OVD group \nAt T6 and T12. The ALF group exhibited significantly higher PD and IS values (P \n\u02c2 0.05) compared to the OVD group At T6 and T12. The OVD group had the greatest \nsignificant CBL values (P\u2009<.05) at T6 and T12, whereas the SF group presented \nthe lowest significant values. The ALF and SF groups showed the highest \nsignificant satisfaction levels (P\u2009<.05) regarding appearance, esthetics, \nretention, stability, chewing, bolus quality, and occlusion. On the other hand, \nthe OVD group expressed the highest significant satisfaction (P\u2009<.05) with \nsurgery, healing, and cleaning.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fixed restorations supported by either short implants or long \nimplants inserted in augmented bone are equally successful in the rehabilitation \nof the atrophic posterior mandible, with improved patient satisfaction than \nimplant-assisted partial dentures. Nevertheless, the SF group had favorable \nperi-implant soft tissue health and decreased marginal bone loss compared to the \nALF group. Conversely, implant-assisted partial overdentures demonstrated \nfavorable peri-implant soft tissue health and increased patient satisfaction \nregarding surgery and healing compared to fixed restoration.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Trial NCT05978115 (28/07/2023) \"Retrospectively \nregistered\"."}

Approximately \n200 eligible participants brushed for 2weeks with a fluoride acclimatization \ntoothpaste before randomization to brushing 2/daily with a sodium bicarbonate \n(test) or fluoride (control) toothpaste. No pre-prophylaxis was conducted prior \nto study start. Modified gingival index (MGI), bleeding index (BI) and Turesky \nplaque index (TPI), were measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12weeks. Participants \ncompleted a diary for compliance monitoring.\nRESULTS: 190 participants were randomised, 188 completed the study. The test \ngroup demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in number of bleeding \nsites from baseline to 12-weeks (p=0.0032), 6-weeks (p=0.0031) and 3-weeks \n(p=0.0091), and compared to control group from baseline to 12-weeks (p=0.0013). \nThe test group showed significantly (all p<0.0001) decreased mean MGI score from \nbaseline to 3-weeks, 6-weeks, and 12-weeks compared to control group; \nsignificantly decreased mean overall TPI score from baseline to 3-weeks \n(p=0.0012), 6-weeks (p=0.0058), and 12-weeks (p<0.0001) compared to control; and \nsignificantly reduced mean interproximal TPI scores compared to control group \nfrom baseline to 3-weeks (p=0.0022), 6-weeks (p=0.0099) and 12-weeks (p<0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Twice daily toothbrushing with a sodium bicarbonate toothpaste \nsignificantly improved oral health reducing localised gingivitis compared to \nbrushing with a conventional fluoride toothpaste, measured by BI, MGI and TPI \nover 12 weeks.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Localised, gingivitis can be resolved or prevented with \nexcellent home-use oral hygiene measures, but this is rarely achieved with \nmechanical brushing alone.

A literature search \nwas conducted in August 2024 in two electronic databases (Web of Science, \nPubMed), and EBSCO, and Google Scholar for articles written in English reporting \nperiodontal diseases in pregnant adolescents (15-19 years) and young adults \n(20-24 years) in Nigeria following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). This review excluded \nabstracts, literature reviews, conference proceedings, letters to the editor, \nand editorials. Information extracted from the publications that met the \ninclusion criteria were the study design, study location, sample size, gestation \nstage, prevalence of periodontal diseases, and identified risk factors for \nperiodontal diseases. A descriptive analysis of the extracted data was \nconducted.\nRESULTS: Among the 768 articles screened, no study met the eligibility criteria. \nHowever, four studies reported on risk factors for periodontal diseases in a \nsample of 1066 pregnant women age\u2009<\u200920 years to >\u200940 years that included 202 \n(18.9%) pregnant adolescents and young adults. The prevalence of periodontal \ndiseases ranged from 45.8 to 100%. One study reported that the highest score of \nhealthy gingivae was among the 20-24 age group; one study reported that \nprevalence of gingivitis increased with increasing trimester; another reported \nthe highest prevalence of gingival bleeding and the lowest prevalence of \ncalculus in the first trimester, while one study could not establish a \nstatistically significant relationship between periodontal diseases and \ngestational age. The four studies were conducted in two of Nigeria's six \ngeopolitical zones, and all were hospital-based.\nCONCLUSION: The lack of generalizable studies on risk factors for periodontal \ndiseases among pregnant adolescents and young adults in Nigeria limits access to \nevidence for policy and program design.

Consequently, revealing the pathogenesis of OLP is a primary concern \nin oral medicine research. Elevated levels of circulating antibodies against \nDesmoglein 3 have been discovered in the serum of OLP patients. The aim of the \npresent study was to evaluate the level of Desmoglein 3 autoantibodies in tissue \nbiopsies of atrophic/bullous erosive OLP and to correlate it with the disease \nseverity, in attempt to reveal if it has a role in the pathogenesis of the \ndisease.\nMETHODS: This is a case-control study, tissue biopsies were obtained from \nclinically and histopathologically diagnosed atrophic/bullous-erosive oral \nlichen planus (OLP) lesions (n\u2009=\u200910). The oral lichen planus biopsies were \ncompared with healthy uninflamed gingival tissues excised during periodontal \nsurgeries (n\u2009=\u200910). The tissue biopsies were tested for quantitative levels of \ndesmoglein 3 autoantibodies using ELISA test. The clinical severity of oral \nlichen planus lesions was evaluated by Elsabagh scoring system. The levels of \ndesmoglein 3 autoantibodies were correlated with the disease severity.\nRESULTS: The concentration of desmoglein 3 autoantibodies level in tissues of \npatients with atrophic/erosive OLP [3395.4 (\u00b1\u2009526.9) Pg/g] was significantly \nhigher (p\u2009<\u20090.001) than in tissues of healthy controls [2329.7 (\u00b1\u2009307.6) Pg/g]. \nThe student's t-test was used to compare between the two groups. Moreover, the \nconcentration of desmoglein 3 autoantibodies showed a statistically significant \npositive correlation (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.801) with OLP clinical severity scores (p\u2009=\u20090.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: Desmoglein 3 autoantibodies were detected in higher concentrations \nin oral lichen planus tissues compared to healthy controls. Increased \nconcentration of desmoglein 3 autoantibodies is correlated with an increase in \noral lichen planus clinical severity scores and vice versa.

A comprehensive systematic review of the existing literature \nwas conducted to enhance understanding of the clinical features and pathogenesis \nof HGF.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The proband was a 9-year-old girl from the Yi ethnic group who \npresented with gum overgrowth. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger \nsequencing were used for mutation analysis. Histological features were analyzed \nusing staining techniques. The pathogenicity of the identified variants was \nevaluated using SIFT2, PROVEAN, Polyphen-2_HDIV and MutationTaster. Alterations \nin protein structure were analyzed using AlphaFold3. A systematic literature \nreview was conducted following PRISMA guidelines.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with significant gingival overgrowth and \nhirsutism. Microscopic examination of the gingival specimens revealed elongated \nrete pegs penetrating into the fibrous connective tissue. Immunofluorescence \nstaining indicated increased expression levels of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13. WES \nidentified 8 heterozygous variants, including a novel SOS1 mutation classified \nas potentially damaging.

A cemented-retained zirconia crown and \na 5-mm diameter abutment, with no inclination, were used in all models. The fit \nbetween the abutment and the implant was performed by a 9-mm length and 1-mm \ndiameter titanium abutment screw. Volumetric finite elements with a linear \ntetrahedral shape (C3D4) and \"tie\" interactions represented 100\u202f% of \nosteointegration. A distributed load of 200\u202fN was applied to the crown, while \nthe bone was fully constrained. For linear analysis, all materials were assumed \nto be linear, elastic, isotropic, and homogeneous. The FEA focused on evaluating \nthe stress distribution within the implant, abutment, and surrounding tissues.\nRESULTS: The hybrid zirconia-titanium assembly exhibited lower peak stress at \nthe gingiva compared to the titanium-zirconia model and the full titanium or \nzirconia implant models. The hybrid titanium-zirconia and the full titanium \nassembly demonstrated the lowest peak stress in the bone, whereas the \nzirconia-titanium model and the full zirconia implant models exhibited higher \nstresses. The full titanium and the titanium-zirconia assemblies exhibited the \nhighest stress concentration at the implant-abutment interface, highlighting \npotential areas for mechanical failure.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Finite element analysis indicates that the hybrid \nzirconia-titanium abutment-implant assembly offers a viable alternative to \nsingle-material implants. The hybrid configurations combine the advantages of \nboth materials, promoting balanced stress distribution and favourable \nbiomechanical performance. The findings suggests that titanium-zirconia hybrid \nimplants may enhance implant longevity and success rates, making them a \npromising option for clinical applications."}

An accurate understanding of the \nepidemiological characteristics of endometriosis is essential for disease \ncontrol and prevention. We aimed to use the latest data from the Global Burden \nof Disease (GBD) 2021 to comprehensively analyze the various epidemiological \nindicators of surgically confirmed endometriosis and their changing trends to \nbetter measure the disease burden and help improve health management.\nMETHODS: We delineated incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability \n(YLDs) of surgically confirmed endometriosis at the global, regional, and \nnational levels. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to \nassess temporal trends in the age-standardized rate (ASR). In addition, we used \njoinpoint regression models to describe local trends in these indicators, \nassessed the correlation between disease burden and Socio-demographic index \n(SDI) levels, and used decomposition analysis to quantitatively analyze the \ndriving factors leading to changes in disease burden.\nRESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized rate of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs \nof surgically confirmed endometriosis all showed a decreasing trend from 1990 to \n2021. The burden of surgically confirmed endometriosis is mainly concentrated in \nwomen aged 20-30 years and declines with increasing SDI levels. The results of \nthe decomposition analysis indicated that population growth is the main driving \nfactor for the upward in the number of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs cases of \nendometriosis worldwide.\nCONCLUSIONS: The overall burden of endometriosis has decreased globally from \n1990 to 2021, but there are regional disparities. Managing this condition \nremains a major challenge, and more refined policies and interventions are \nneeded to effectively address the burden of endometriosis."}

This \nwas a retrospective observational case series conducted by three minimally \ninvasive gynecologic surgeons (X.G., T.K., B.T.) at a single tertiary care \ncenter between August 2021 and January 2025. A total of 92 patients underwent \nRALS using ICG fluorescence; 44 surgeries were performed by two junior surgeons, \nand 48 by a senior surgeon. The senior group had a higher percentage of patients \nwith complete cul-de-sac obliteration (56.3% vs. 18.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Our primary \nsurgical outcome, total operative time, was 233\u00a0min in the junior group and \n348\u00a0min in the senior group, initially showing a significant difference. \nHowever, after adjusting for factors such as history of prior abdominal surgery, \ncul-de-sac obliteration, and additional procedures (resection of ovarian \nremnant, bowel shaving, oophorectomy, enterolysis) using multivariable linear \nregression analysis, no significant difference was observed between the two \ngroups. Other perioperative outcomes-including patient characteristics, \nestimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain at weeks \n1, 2, and 3-were comparable between the groups. Complication rates did not \ndiffer significantly. Notably, there were no cases of temporary or permanent \nureteral injury in either group. These findings suggest that with ICG-assisted \nureteral mapping, junior surgeons can achieve comparable surgical outcomes to \nsenior surgeons.

This study aimed to investigate the interplay between glycolytic \nsignaling and macrophage M2 polarization in EMS.\nMETHODS: Clinical correlations were analyzed in ectopic endometrial tissues from \nEMS patients. Primary endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and Ishikawa cells were \ncultured under hypoxic conditions, and their conditioned media were used to \ntreat THP-1-derived macrophages. Mechanistic investigations were performed \nthrough PDPK1 knockdown, AKT/CD47 overexpression, and lactic acid (LA) \nsupplementation, and the therapeutic potential was assessed in a mouse model of \nEMS treated with PDPK1, CD47, and LDHA inhibitors.\nRESULTS: Ectopic EMS tissues exhibited increased infiltration of CD206+ M2 \nmacrophages, which positively correlated with upregulation of CD47, PDPK1, and \nLDHA. Hypoxia enhanced the proliferation and migration of endometrial cells, \naccompanied by activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway and glycolytic reprogramming, \nas indicated by elevated glucose uptake, LA, and ATP production, and elevated \nexpression of GLUT1, PDK1, and PKM2. Moreover, hypoxia promoted M2 polarization \nof THP-1-derived macrophages, evidenced by an increased CD206+ population, a \ndisrupted M1/M2 ratio, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), and \nelevated anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2). Silencing of PDPK1 attenuated \nhypoxia-induced AKT/mTOR activation and CD47/LDHA expression, thereby reducing \nglycolysis and M2 polarization. These effects were restored by AKT/CD47 \noverexpression or exogenous LA supplementation. In vivo, pharmacological \ninhibition of PDPK1, CD47, or LDHA significantly reduced lesion size, suppressed \nM2 macrophage infiltration, and promoted apoptosis.\nCONCLUSION: PDPK1 promotes M2 polarization via CD47/AKT-LDHA-mediated glycolytic \nreprogramming, thereby exacerbating EMS progression. Targeting this \nglycolysis-immune axis could be a promising therapeutic strategy for EMS."}

To circumvent the need for invasive diagnostic \nprocedures like laparoscopy, research has increasingly focused on imaging-based \nmethods such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI). The limited diagnostic accuracy achieved through manual interpretation of \nthese imaging techniques has driven the development of automated classifiers \nthat can effectively utilize both modalities. However, patients often undergo \nonly one of these two examinations, resulting in unpaired data for training and \ntesting POD obliteration classifiers, where TVUS models tend to be more accurate \nthan MRI models, but TVUS scanning are more operator dependent. This prompts a \ncrucial question: Can a model be trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data to \nenhance the performance of a model exclusively trained with MRI, while \nmaintaining the high accuracy of the model individually trained with TVUS? In \nthis paper we aim to answer this question by proposing a novel multi-modal POD \nobliteration classifier that is trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data and \ntested using either MRI or TVUS data.

In a mouse model of endometriosis, PCB-126 exposure significantly \npromoted the growth of ectopic lesions by activating the Steroid Receptor \nCoactivator-1 (SRC-1) isoform/Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9)/Estrogen \nReceptor-\u03b2 (ER\u03b2) axis, a key driver of disease progression.

Before and after the RT, \ncirculating stress biomarkers (calcium, inorganic phosphate, creatine kinase \n[CK], total antioxidant capacity [TAC]), inflammation (tumour necrosis \nfactor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1]), interleukin 10 (IL-10), vascular endothelial growth \nfactor and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were analyzed by immunology multiplex \nassay and ELISA. Moreover, maximal strength to back squat (1RM-SQ) and squat \njump (SJ) performance were measured.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that, compared with N, the HH group exhibited a \nlarge increase in 1RM-SQ and SJ (all ES\u2009>\u20090.99; p\u2009<\u20090.041) outcomes. IL-10 and \nTNF-\u03b1 levels increased in HH more and faster than N (all ES\u2009>\u20091.35; p\u2009<\u20090.003), \nreturning to baseline following the RT. Circulating HSP70 revealed\u00a0a similar \ntrend, although remaining elevated in HH after the program (all ES\u2009>\u20091.106; \np\u2009<\u20090.029). HSP70 in HH explained\u2009~\u200944% of TNF-\u03b1 variance (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In \naddition, the RT program in HH induced greater decreases in TAC and CK than N \n(all ES\u2009<\u2009- 0.95; p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the potential role of moderate altitude in \nlong-term RT for inducing greater stress while maintaining the inflammatory \nbalance, crucial for muscle adaptations in young males. Consequently, HH \ncondition revealed an additional benefit in the contractile and explosive muscle \nstrength development."}

Several markers have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease \n(IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, none is sufficiently reliable \nto enable accurate diagnosis. We characterized a broad panel of serum proteins \nto assess disease-specific biomarker profiles and associate these findings with \nfaecal microbiota composition in newly diagnosed IBD and IBS patients and \nhealthy individuals. The study cohort consisted of 49 newly diagnosed \ntreatment-na\u00efve adult patients (13 Crohn's disease (CD), 13 ulcerative colitis \n(UC), and 23 IBS) and 12 healthy individuals. Inflammatory and \nmetabolism-related serum proteins were assessed using PEA multiplex panels, \nwhile gut microbiota composition was determined by 16\u00a0s rRNA gene amplicon \nsequencing. Serum proteins AXIN1, TNFSF14, RNASE3, EN-RAGE, OSM, ST1A1, CA13 and \nNADK were identified as markers with the most promising specificity/sensitivity \nand predictivity between healthy and disease groups, while IL-17A and TNFRSF9 \nenabled differentiation between IBD and IBS patients.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "IBS", "text": "BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested correlations between mood \ninstability and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, however, the causal \nrelationships remain unclear.\nMETHODS: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to \ninvestigate the causal relationships between mood instability and 22 GI \ndisorders using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from disease-relevant \nGWAS studies, the UK Biobank, and the FinnGen project. To ensure the robustness \nof causal estimates, we applied multiple MR methods and extensive sensitivity \nanalyses. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step mediation analyses \nwere performed to explore direct causal effects and potential mediating factors.\nRESULTS: After multiple-testing correction, genetic liability to mood \ninstability was significantly associated with an increased risk of four GI \ndisorders: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome \n(IBS), diverticular disease, and cholelithiasis. Reverse MR analysis further \nsuggested that genetically predicted GERD and IBS also increased the risk of \nmood instability. These findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses and \nwere validated in independent datasets. Moreover, MVMR and mediation analyses \nindicated that smoking and depression may partially mediate the causal effects \non GERD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mood instability, as a personality trait, may play a causal role in \nthe development of multiple GI disorders. Our findings suggest that behavioral \ninterventions, such as smoking cessation, may help reduce GI risk among \nindividuals prone to mood instability. This highlights the potential for \nintegrated behavioral-gastrointestinal risk stratification, where psychological \nprofiling could help to identify individuals at high-risk and inform targeted \nprevention and intervention strategies."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "IBS", "text": "BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal infections are an increased cause of morbimortality \nworldwide. The most effective preventive strategy is adequate vaccination. The \naim of this work was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and associated factors \nfor vulnerable hospitalized patients, and the opportunity of vaccination within \nhospitalization.\nMETHODS: Observational study conducted on a secondary care public hospital. The \nsample was composed of patients admitted to an Internal Medicine service, \nexcluding participants with terminal conditions. Descriptive and bivariate \nanalyses using chi-square and t-tests were applied. To detect profiles of \nnon-vaccinated patients, a dendrogram was fitted using cluster analysis \ntechniques. Multivariable logistic regression models were designed to analyse \nassociated factors with vaccination uptake. Vaccination was finally applied if \nindicated.\nFINDINGS: A total of 388 patients were included. Of them, 330 (85.7\u00a0%) had \nindication of pneumococcal vaccination, but only 180 (54.4\u00a0%) had received any \nprevious vaccination, and 276 with indication (83.6\u00a0%) were not correctly \nvaccinated. During hospitalization, 192 (49.7\u00a0%) of the admitted patients were \nvaccinated. Vaccination coverage was higher in patients with chronic heart \nfailure (59.4\u00a0%) or diabetes mellitus (57.5\u00a0%) than in patients with neoplasia \n(50.9\u00a0%) or chronic hepatopathy (26.7\u00a0%). The main factors associated with lower \nvaccination coverage were sex female (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.74, 95\u00a0%CI: 1.13-2.68) and COVID-19 \ninfection (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.50, 95\u00a0%CI: 1.36-9.01).\nINTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that hospitalized patients, mostly elderly \npatients with high frequency of comorbidities and indication of antipneumococcal \nvaccine (e.g., Internal Medicine or Geriatric services), have low vaccination \nuptake. Therefore, hospitalization admission could be a great opportunity to \nincrease pneumococcal vaccination coverage in patients at risk. Further studies \nshould confirm the associations with lower coverage to optimize future \nvaccination strategies."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "IBS", "text": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is considered a disorder of brain-gut \ninteraction. Central processes like selective attention to visceral stimuli are \ninvolved in the pathophysiology of IBS. The primary aim of this study was to \nreplicate the Tkal\u010di\u0107 and colleagues' experiment using the same modified Stroop \ntask to assess the reliability of previously obtained results. A secondary \nobjective was to explore the proposed associations between attentional indices \nand various aspects of anxiety and interoceptive accuracy.\nMETHODS: Ninety IBS patients and 77 healthy controls (HC) completed a set of \nquestionnaires [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), Visceral Sensitivity \nIndex (VSI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Anxious Thoughts Inventory \n(ATI)] followed by a heartbeat counting task and an emotional Stroop task.\nRESULTS: Repeated measures 2-way ANOVA showed no significant effects. GLMM \nresults showed that IBS patients had shorter RTs (~50\u00a0ms) than HCs. The IBS \ngroup scored higher than HC in all anxiety measures, while there were no \ndifferences in IAcc. Positive correlations were found among all anxiety measures \nin both groups. There was a negative correlation of average RT with ASI, ATI, \nand IAcc, only in the IBS group. IBS patients with higher ASI and ATI have \nfaster RTs, while patients with higher IAcc have lower RTs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stroop facilitation was not replicated, but IBS patients were \nfaster than HCs. This study provides preliminary evidence that IBS patients may \nshow distinct attentional patterns, marked by a general tendency for faster \nengagement, independent of stimulus type. This effect may relate to higher \ninteroceptive accuracy and anxiety, and was not observed in HCs."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "osteoporosis", "text": "Antibiotic use is known to contribute to the development of osteoporosis, \nalthough the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Metronidazole (MET), a \ncommonly prescribed antibiotic for treating anaerobic infections, has been \nlinked to alterations in the gut microbiota (GM), which in turn are associated \nwith various adverse side effects in the host. Recent studies have shown that \nthe GM plays a key role in regulating bone homeostasis, though the underlying \nmechanisms remain under investigation. In this study, we demonstrate for the \nfirst time that MET promotes inflammatory osteoporosis through gut dysbiosis, \nwith Klebsiella variicola (K. variicola) identified as a major pathogen \ninfluencing bone metabolism.

Cell experiments showed that the combined application of CPE and L. \nplantarum (CPEL) significantly promoted the proliferation, differentiation, and \nextracellular matrix mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, CPEL \nactivated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and BMP2/Smad signaling pathways, which are \nessential for bone formation. The multi-omics integration of metabolomics and \nmolecular docking revealed key metabolic changes, particularly in amino acid and \ncarbohydrate metabolic pathways, contributing to enhanced osteogenic activity. \nMolecular docking also clarified the strong binding interactions between \ndifferential metabolites (leucine, salicylic acid, and fumaric acid) and \nosteogenic targets, providing new insights into plant component-microbe synergy \nin functional food development.\nCONCLUSION: The combined application of CPE and L. plantarum could promote bone \nformation through multiple targets and pathways.

In the context of various chronic pathologies, this condition may present \nan even higher prevalence, impacting morbidity, mortality, and healthcare \nburden.\nOBJECTIVE: To synthesize and compare available evidence from systematic reviews \non the prevalence of osteoporosis across different chronic diseases.\nMETHODOLOGY: An umbrella review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted, \nfocusing on systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis) reporting \nprevalence data of osteoporosis in adults with at least one chronic disease. \nDatabases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE, were \nsearched, covering publications between 2009 and 2023, without language \nrestrictions. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data \nextraction, resolving discrepancies through consensus. A risk of bias assessment \nwas conducted using the ROBIS tool. Prevalence estimates reported in each review \nwere analyzed, classifying diseases according to the magnitude of the \npercentages found.\nRESULTS: Thirteen systematic reviews were evaluated (twelve included \nmeta-analyses). The highest prevalence of osteoporosis was observed in patients \nwith Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (up to 36.8%) and diabetes mellitus \n(approximately 27.7%). Other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple \nsclerosis, liver cirrhosis, and celiac disease, showed variable prevalence but \nwere equally relevant in clinical terms. Methodological heterogeneity, both in \ndiagnostic criteria and populations, was a notable factor.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for systematic assessment of bone \nhealth in patients with chronic diseases, particularly those with a higher \nprevalence of osteoporosis. These findings underscore the importance of timely \nscreening strategies and multidisciplinary approaches to prevent fractures and \noptimize comprehensive care.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "osteoporosis", "text": "Accurate assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) is essential for diagnosing \nosteoporosis, but conventional quantitative CT protocols are associated with \nrelatively high radiation doses. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of \na novel dual-parameter optimized ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT) protocol for \nquantitative BMD\u00a0assessment in the lumbar spine, comparing its radiation dose, \nimage quality, and diagnostic performance against standard-dose CT (SD-CT). In \nthis prospective study, 245 patients undergoing lumbar surgery received paired \npre- and postoperative CT scans: SD-CT (120kV/250mAs) and ULD-CT (100kV/30mAs). \nRadiation dose metrics (CTDIvol, DLP, effective dose [ED]), objective image \nquality (noise, SNR, CNR), and subjective quality (5-point Likert scale) were \nanalyzed. Volumetric BMD (vBMD) was measured using QCT and classified per \nAmerican College of Radiology criteria (normal, osteopenia, osteoporosis). \nDiagnostic performance was evaluated via sensitivity/specificity and ROC \nanalysis. ULD-CT reduced radiation dose by 92.5% compared to SD-CT (ED: 0.88 vs. \n11.68 mSv; CTDIvol: 1.93 vs. 25.66\u00a0mGy, both P < 0.001). While SD-CT \ndemonstrated superior objective (P=0.001-0.01) and subjective image quality \n(P<0.001), ULD-CT maintained diagnostic acceptability (scores \u22653; interobserver \nICC=0.73). ULD-CT showed slight BMD overestimation but no significant \ndifferences in gender, age, or osteoporosis subgroups (P>0.05). ROC analysis \nrevealed high diagnostic accuracy for ULD-CT (AUC: 0.986-0.996), with \nsensitivity/specificity of 94.74-100% and 95.74-98.01%, respectively. The \ndual-parameter ULD-CT protocol achieves substantial radiation reduction (92.5%) \nwhile preserving the image quality and diagnostic accuracy for osteoporosis \nclassification, offering a safer alternative for longitudinal BMD monitoring \nwithout compromising clinical utility."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "osteoporosis", "text": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have highlighted the frequent occurrence of \nsarcopenia in patients with pancreatic diseases, including chronic pancreatitis. \nWe aimed to clarify the prevalence of skeletal muscle (SM) loss and sarcopenia, \nand their associations with clinical characteristics, bone mineral density, and \npancreatic imaging findings in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).\nMETHODS: This study included 114 patients with AIP treated at Tohoku University \nHospital. The SM index was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis \ndevice, grip strength was measured using a hand dynamometer, and bone mineral \ndensity was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Univariate and \nmultivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze factors \nassociated with SM loss and sarcopenia.\nRESULTS: Among 114 patients, 57 (50.0%) had SM loss, 31 (27.2%) had reduced grip \nstrength, and 27 (23.7%) had both. Patients with SM loss were older and had a \nlower body mass index, weaker grip strength, higher Controlling Nutritional \nStatus scores, and lower serum lipase and albumin levels compared to those \nwithout SM loss. Computed tomography scans revealed a higher prevalence of \npancreatic parenchymal atrophy in patients with SM loss. Similar differences \nwere observed between patients with sarcopenia and those without. Osteopathy was \nobserved in 35.6% of patients with SM loss and 38.1% of those with sarcopenia, \nwhereas only 4.1% of patients without SM loss had osteopathy. Low BMI (< 21.0 \nkg/m2) was also found to be an independent risk factor for SM loss in \nmultivariate analysis. Age > 72 years, low BMI (< 20.0 kg/m2), and low serum \nlipase levels (< 13 U/L) were independent risk factors for sarcopenia in \nmultivariate analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: SM loss and sarcopenia are prevalent in patients with AIP and are \nassociated with aging, poor nutritional status, low serum lipase levels, and \npancreatic parenchymal atrophy. In addition to the high risk of osteopathy, \ncareful attention should be paid to maintain muscle health in AIP patients."}

Studies have highlighted \nthe significant role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the survival of leukemia patients. \nHowever, the heterogeneity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and their impact on clinical \ncorrelation in the peripheral blood of patients with DLBCL remain unclear.\nMETHOD: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed on 9 blood samples, \nsourced from 6 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 3 healthy \nindividuals (HIs), to delineate clinically pertinent \u03b3\u03b4 T cell states and \nsubsets in DLBCL patients. Flow cytometry was then employed to validate the \nrelationship between DLBCL prognosis and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets.\nRESULT: Our study integrated genetic drivers through consensus clustering, \nleading to the identification of 6 distinct \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets in DLBCL and HIs. \nThese subsets include a na\u00efve \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset characterized by TCF7 and LEF1 \nexpression, a memory \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset sharing common genes such as GZMK, IL7R, \nan anti-tumor \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset with overexpression of IFNG, TNF, and CD69, and \ntwo subsets exhibiting TIGIT overexpression indicative of an exhausted \u03b3\u03b4 T cell \nphenotype. Additionally, a cytotoxic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset marked by increased NKG7 \nand GZMB levels was identified. Our results revealed that while \u03b3\u03b4 T cells \npossess anti-tumor capacities, their functional effectiveness is diminished due \nto differentiation into exhausted subpopulations. Several clusters with high \ncytotoxicity scores also showed elevated exhaustion scores (C13-\u03b3\u03b4-TIGIT.1, \nC14-\u03b3\u03b4-TIGIT.2), suggesting the presence of a population in DLBCL samples that \nis simultaneously exhausted and cytotoxic. In particular, the TIGIT.2 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell \nsubset manifests a more pronounced exhaustion score relative to TIGIT.1 \u03b3\u03b4 T \ncell subset, indicating differential levels of cellular exhaustion among these \ngroups. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between high expression \nof TIGIT \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets and poorer patient prognoses. We also discovered \nunique expression profiles within these subgroups: TIGIT.1 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are marked \nby elevated CXCR4 expression, contrasting with the TIGIT.2 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subgroup \nwhich exhibits increased CX3CR1 expression. Pseudotime analysis implies a \npotential differentiation trajectory from na\u00efve and GZMK \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to various \nterminally differentiated subsets, with genes associated with stemness (e.g., \nTCF-1) subsequently downregulated. These findings suggest that TIGIT.2 subset \nmay be further along in the differentiation trajectory, potentially representing \na more terminally differentiated state than TIGIT.1 subset. According to our \nclinical validation cohort, the TIGIT+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset is highly expressed in \npatients and correlates with poor prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: We identified genetic subtypes of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with distinct genotypic \nand clinical characteristics in DLBCL patients. Expression levels within these \nsubgroups emerged as potential indicators for patient outcomes and as crucial \nfactors in shaping therapeutic strategies. These insights significantly advance \nour understanding of intricate relationships among cellular subgroups and their \nroles in influencing disease progression and patient prognosis."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "leukemia", "text": "BACKGROUND: Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have prolonged survival \nin chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however continuous administration \nincreases toxicity. Little is known about clinical outcomes of patients who \ndiscontinue BTKi for reasons other than CLL progression. We aimed to report \nthese outcomes.\nPATIENTS/METHODS: With the CLL Society, we solicited volunteers with CLL who \nself-reported BTKi discontinuation for reasons other than CLL progression to \nparticipate in a web-based survey.\nRESULTS: In 170 patients, BTKi was discontinued for toxicity, because CLL was in \nremission, or personal choice in 62%, 14% and 8%, respectively. When asked how \nthey felt about stopping the BTKi, most were relieved that they may eliminate \ntoxicity (45%), could focus less on CLL (11%), and would not have to pay for the \nmedicine (7%), while 29% experienced anxiety. A statistically significant \nincrease in perceived quality of life (QOL) was observed from prior- versus \npost-BTKi discontinuation. Of patients who reported that they experienced \nclinical CLL progression (n = 80), 46% reported that these events did not happen \nfor \u2265 1 year after BTKi discontinuation. Those that were on a BTKi for \u2265 2 years \nbefore discontinuation had more time without CLL relapse.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data provide a unique report of patient experiences. The data \nsuggest that BTKi may be feasible and result in a period of treatment-free \nremission. The data also indicate that patients are generally relieved when they \nanticipate BTKi discontinuation and observe significant QOL improvements after \nBTKi discontinuation. As such, these data should prompt prospective study of \ntime-limited BTKi therapy for CLL."}

The combination of \ntargeted drugs could improve the clinical efficacy only to some extent, due to \noverlapping toxicities and difficulty in maintaining certain drug ratios. Here, \nwe report on ratiometric codelivery of FLT3 and CDK4/6 dual inhibitors, \ngilteritinib and palbociclib, by daratumumab-decorated polymersomes (GIPA@DP) \nfor high-efficacy targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Second, responder leukemic cells \nexhibited transposable element (TE)-associated type I interferon signaling \nupregulation. Primitive leukemic clones displayed IMPDH2-high states linked to \nBCL2 inhibitor sensitivity, while resistant monocytic populations upregulated \nglycolysis and MCL1 to bypass BCL2 dependence. Leveraging these insights, we \nestablished a prognostic signature predicting patient responses to \nvenetoclax-based therapies, validated in independent cohorts (Tumor Profiler, \nBeatAML2). High-risk patients identified by this signature demonstrated \nheightened sensitivity to IGF-1R inhibition.

FLT3 inhibitor (FLT3i) maintenance \ntherapy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) \nhas emerged as a promising strategy to improve outcomes in this high-risk \npopulation.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized \ncontrolled trials (RCTs) evaluating FLT3i maintenance therapy versus standard of \ncare (SOC) after allo-HCT in patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated acute myeloid \nleukemia (AML). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and \nClinicalTrials.gov was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Primary \noutcomes included relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and \nFLT3i-related adverse events. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risks \n(RRs) were calculated using the \"meta\" package in R (version 4.4.0).\nRESULTS: Four RCTs including 701 patients (ages 18-78) met inclusion criteria. \nFLT3i maintenance significantly reduced relapse (HR 0.50; 95\u202f% CI: 0.34-0.74) \nand mortality (HR 0.63; 95\u202f% CI: 0.44-0.91) compared to SOC. Hematologic \ntoxicity (RR 2.12; 95\u202f% CI: 1.67-2.70) and chronic GVHD (RR 1.18; 95\u202f% CI: \n1.00-1.41) were more frequent in the FLT3i group.

By sharing this \ncase, we aim to provide clinicians with practical experience and valuable \ninsights, thereby enhancing awareness and understanding of this rare condition \nwithin the medical community.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old female presented to the hospital with a 10-day \nhistory of a perianal mass and hematochezia. Physical examination revealed a \nsoft, flat abdomen with no palpable masses and normal bowel sounds. Imaging \nfindings showed localized thickening of the distal rectum, diffuse mild \nthickening of the mid-to-upper rectal wall, and multiple small lymph nodes in \nthe sigmoid mesocolon.Postoperative histopathological analysis, supported by \nimmunohistochemical staining, confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

Hydrophilic metabolites in the tissue \nand saliva samples were comprehensively analyzed using capillary \nelectrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Using these candidate metabolites, a multiple \nlogistic regression (MLR) model was developed to differentiate SC from HCs \nRESULTS: Sixty-six and 12 metabolites showed significant differences in tissues \nand saliva, respectively. Of these, six metabolites were commonly different \nbetween SC and HCs. Spermidine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and isoleucine were \nselected to develop the MLR model.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that VIP receptor \nsignaling promotes liver metastasis in melanoma, and targeting this pathway with \nVIP receptor antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating \nmetastatic UVM."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "melanoma", "text": "BACKGROUND: Primary malignant melanoma of the vagina (PMMV) and cervix (PMMC) \nare extremely rare tumors with a poor prognosis, lacking well-defined protocols \nor standardized treatment guidelines. While the preferred management for \nearly-stage PMMV and PMMC is surgery, comprehensive reports on the impact of \nvarious surgical techniques on cancer outcomes are scarce.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare outcomes between open and minimally \ninvasive surgery (MIS) in PMMV and PMMC, and concurrently evaluated prognostic \nrisk factors for these conditions.\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of PMMV and \nPMMC patients treated surgically from January 2000 to July 2021. \nClinicopathological features and surgical outcomes were assessed \nretrospectively. Patients underwent either open surgery or MIS. Disease-Free \nSurvival (DFS) rates were compared.\nRESULTS: Of 45 eligible patients, the MIS group showed a higher rate of total \nvaginectomy (P\u2009=\u20090.022), reduced median intraoperative blood loss (P\u2009=\u20090.031), \nshorter median hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.042), and no significant increase in \nperioperative complications (P\u2009=\u20090.867). The incidence of negative \nmargins\u2009<\u20091\u00a0cm was significantly lower in the MIS group (P\u2009=\u20090.032). Cox \nproportional hazards regression identified microsatellites (HR\u2009=\u20092.893 \n[1.042-8.029]; P\u2009=\u20090.042), surgical negative margin distance (HR\u2009=\u20090.042 \n[0.008-0.217]; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and total vaginectomy (HR\u2009=\u20090.042 [0.008-0.217]; \nP\u2009<\u20090.001) as independent prognostic factors for DFS. MIS was linked to a \nsignificant difference in 2-year DFS (P\u2009=\u20090.030), but there was no notable \ndifference in overall survival (OS) compared to open surgery (P\u2009=\u20090.078). The \noutcomes are validated through sensitivity analysis and hierarchical assessment, \nleading to the development of a novel nomogram simultaneously.\nCONCLUSIONS: Total vaginectomy may improve DFS in PMMV and PMMC patients. A \ncombination of MIS and radical vaginal resection can effectively manage PMMV and \nPMMC as an initial surgical strategy."}

A machine \nlearning-based algorithm trained with information on the biological effects and \nmolecular descriptors of analgesics, anesthetics, hypnotics and opioids \npredicted antitumor effects for dexmedetomidine (DEX). DEX is a sedative acting \nas an alpha2-adrenoceptor (ADRA2) agonist. Based on these premises, we \ninvestigated the putative antineoplastic effects of DEX.\nRESULTS: In vitro, DEX promoted premortem stresses such as autophagy and partial \nendoplasmic reticulum stress with the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation \nfactor 2 alpha and the inhibition of the splicing of X-box binding protein 1. \nDEX elicited the biomarkers of immunogenic cell death, including the release of \nATP and high-mobility group box 1 protein, and the cell surface exposure of \ncalreticulin, enhancing the engulfment of malignant cells by dendritic cells. In \nimmunocompetent mice, DEX decreased the progression of colorectal cancers, \nfibrosarcomas, mammary carcinomas and melanomas, as it improved overall \nsurvival. These effects were inhibited by the ADRA2 antagonist yohimbine, \nsuggesting that DEX mediates its anticancer effects at least in part on-target. \nDepending on the specific tumor model, DEX also enhanced the cytotoxic T \ncell/regulatory T cell ratio in the tumor bed and draining lymph nodes. \nProgrammed cell death protein 1 blockade tended to improve DEX effects. After \nrechallenge with antigenically identical cells, no tumor appeared, indicating \nthe formation of immunological memory.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the machine learning-predicted anticancer \nactivity of DEX. Beyond its utility as a sedative agent in oncological intensive \ncare, DEX may improve anticancer immunosurveillance and sensitize tumors to \nimmune checkpoint blockade."}

We further show that the \nmast cell secretome can induce macrophage differentiation and a unique \npolarisation pattern via CSF1 and other mediators. Mast cell-derived CSF1 has \nsystemic functions, as mast cell-specific CSF1-deficient mice have lower serum \nCSF1 levels and reduced numbers of circulating monocytes. In addition, using an \northotopic transplantation-based melanoma mouse model, we show that loss of mast \ncell-derived CSF1 promotes cancer cell expansion. Finally, we demonstrate that \nCSF1 is also prestored and released by human mast cells.\nCONCLUSION: CSF1 is an evolutionarily conserved, constitutive mast cell granule \ncomponent.

Despite recommendations for opioid use \nto manage AVOC pain, regional variations and biases in pain management persist, \nparticularly in Saudi Arabia, where the prevalence of SCD varies by region.\nOBJECTIVE: To identify national trends in pain management for AVOC in EDs across \nSaudi Arabia and analyze the duration and frequency of ED visits.\nDESIGN: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.\nSETTINGS: Multiple acute care centers in Saudi Arabia under the Ministry of \nNational Guard Health Affairs, including EDs and urgent care centers in Riyadh, \nJeddah, Al-Ahsa, Dhahran, and Medina.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 421 SCD patients presenting with AVOC between \n2016 and 2021 were included. Patients with other complications such as \ninfections or acute chest syndrome were excluded. Data on patient demographics, \nED visit frequency, length of stay, and medications administered were collected.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the duration and frequency of \nED visits and the types and frequency of analgesics administered.\nSAMPLE SIZE: The study included 421 patients accounting for 20 508 ED visits.\nRESULTS: The average length of stay per ED visit was 4.7 hours. Morphine was the \nmost frequently used opioid, administered to 86% of patients, while paracetamol \nwas the most commonly used analgesic overall (93%). Regional differences were \nobserved, with less opioid use in the Eastern region, where the disease is less \nsevere due to haplotype variations. Ketamine was used in 13% of cases, \npredominantly in the Western region.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study highlights a diverse approach to AVOC management across \nSaudi Arabia, with variations influenced by regional differences and physician \npractices. Paracetamol and morphine were the primary analgesics, though \ndisparities in opioid use suggest the need for standardized pain management \nprotocols.\nLIMITATIONS: This study was limited to centers under one organization and \nexcluded patients with coexisting conditions, which may limit generalizability."}

Globally, an estimated 19%, 9%, and 6% of women \nexperience psychological, physical, and sexual IPV, respectively, during \npregnancy. These rates are higher among pregnant women living with a \nstigmatizing disease. In this study, we examined the effect of antenatal \nscreening for sickle cell disease (SCD) using the sickle cell solubility test on \nthe risk of IPV among pregnant women in the city of Nagpur in Maharashtra state \nof India. We hypothesized that a positive solubility test increases the risk of \nIPV via partner disclosure.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cohort study comparing IPV in 182 pregnant women, before \n(baseline) and after (endline) having a solubility test. Of the 182 \nparticipants, 91 were pregnant women with a positive solubility test and 91 with \na negative solubility test. We used the 49-item Indian Family Violence and \nControl Scale (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.88) to measure IPV and estimated associations using \nbinomial logistic regressions with robust standard errors.\nRESULTS: Pregnant women with a positive solubility test were at least twice as \nlikely to experience physical, sexual, or psychological IPV as pregnant women \nwith a negative solubility test, even after adjusting for baseline differences \nbetween these two groups on common IPV risk factors including the lower level of \neducation and scheduled-caste membership.\nCONCLUSION: Pregnant women who have a positive solubility test are at risk of \nIPV after following routine instructions to disclose their test results to their \nmale partners, so that they can undergo further testing to determine the baby's \nrisk of SCD, sickle cell trait, or no risk.\nIMPLICATIONS: In resource-poor settings with high SCD prevalence, antenatal \nclinics are increasingly screening pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child \ntransmission of SCD. There is a need to integrate strategies for women to \ndisclose sickle cell screening test results and prevention of IPV caused by male \npartners."}

Primary endpoints included the need for \nreintervention, length of hospital stay, procedure-related complications, and \nmortality. Random-effects model was used to calculate mean difference (MD) and \nodds ratio (OR) under a 95\u202f% confidence interval (CI). Cost-effective analysis \nand subanalyses for the randomized studies were conducted.\nRESULTS: A total of 19 studies involving 23,996 patients were included. A \nsignificant reduction in reintervention was observed with EMBSurgery (OR 0.21, \nCI 0.04-0.79), while EMB showed a non-significant reduction (OR 0.41, CI \n0.12-1.32), compared to surgery. EMBSurgery neither significantly increased \nhospital stay (MD 4.80, CI -0.435-11.4) nor yielded higher complications (OR \n1.11, CI 0.49-2.36) compared to surgery. Indeed, lower mortality was observed in \nboth groups (EMB: OR 0.61, CI 0.03-5.08; EMBSurgery: OR 0.41, CI 0.03-3.05) and \nprocedural costs were not significantly higher for EMB and EMBSurgery compared \nto surgery (EMB: MD 32,000, CI -13,500-70,300; EMBSurgery: MD 16,200, CI \n-40,100-72,600). Subanalyses revealed significantly lower reintervention rates \nin the EMBSurgery group versus the surgery group (OR 0.34, CI 0.16-0.74; I2 \n0\u202f%).\nCONCLUSION: EMB combined with surgery seems to reduce reinterventions in cSDH \ncompared to surgery alone with non significant complications that need further \nanalysis through randomized trials with longer follow-ups."}

These data are especially underrepresented \nin the literature from eastern Europe and central Asia (EECA).\nOBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to describe the peer-reviewed literature \non cognitive health among PLWH in the EECA region.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We selected articles from peer-reviewed journals that \nreported on cognitive assessments or the prevalence and characteristics of \ncognitive disorders among adult (\u226518 years) PLWH in EECA countries (Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, \nLithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). \nStudies assessing cognition among PLWH related to traumatic brain injury, brain \ntumours, COVID-19, meningitis, neurosyphilis and/or other central nervous system \ninfections were excluded.\nSOURCE OF EVIDENCE: We searched for relevant data published up to March 2025 \nusing four online databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO).\nCHARTING METHODS: Covidence, a web-based collaborative software platform, was \nused for data screening and extraction. Two independent reviewers screened \nabstracts and full texts, resolving disagreements through consensus. The data \nwere extracted based on the predefined data extraction criteria.\nRESULTS: A total of 1388 peer-reviewed articles were identified; 295 articles \nwere removed due to duplication; and 1053 and 25 articles were excluded based on \nthe abstract/title and full-text screenings, respectively. Finally, 15 articles \nmet the inclusion criteria. All 15 studies used different neuropsychological \nassessments to measure cognitive performance by domain and/or cognitive \ndisorders among various subgroups of PLWH. One cross-sectional study focused on \nolder populations (\u226540 years old), using standardised cognitive performance \nassessment tests. However, it neither provided information about the prevalence \nestimate of cognitive disorders nor identified risk factors.\nCONCLUSION: Existing literature on cognitive disorders among older PLWH in the \nEECA region is limited and insufficient to estimate prevalence, or identify risk \nfactors, and ultimately develop appropriate policy addressing the needs of older \nPLWH in this region. This scoping review underscores the urgent need for \nlarge-scale, longitudinal studies employing standardised, culturally adapted \nneuropsychological batteries and adherence to rigorous reporting standards."}

However, its efficacy in treating \npediatric tuberculous meningitis-related hydrocephalus (TBMH) remains uncertain. \nThe authors' review aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ETV \ncompared to VPS.\nMETHODS: The authors searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for articles \ncomparing ETV with VPS in the pediatric population. They included studies \nevaluated success rate, mortality, postprocedural complications, and infections. \nA random-effects model was used, with heterogeneity assessed with I2 and \nsensitivity analysis.\nRESULTS: A pooled analysis of 369 patients from 5 studies (2 randomized \ncontrolled trials and 3 observational studies), including 162 patients who \nunderwent ETV and 207 VPS, revealed no significant difference in the success \nrates between ETV and VPS for TBMH (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45-1.14, p = 0.159, I2 = \n0%). Furthermore, no significant differences in the postoperative complication \n(OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08-4.17, p = 0.599, I2 = 75%), mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI \n0.23-2.65, p = 0.684, I2 = 0%), or infection (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09-2.87, I2 = \n11%) rates were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The authors' meta-analysis shows no significant differences in \nsuccess rates, mortality risk, and incidence of complications and infections \nbetween ETV and VPS for children with TBMH. However, the broad confidence \nintervals and limited number of included studies introduce significant \nuncertainty. Therefore, while no statistically significant differences have been \ndemonstrated, the equivalence of these treatments cannot be conclusively \naffirmed, and the potential for clinically significant differences remains."}

The clinical \ncharacteristics, tomography data, and occurrence of CSF fistulas were documented \nin these patients.\nRESULTS: Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of admission for most of \nthe 31 patients with anterior skull base fractures (ASBF) (71%, n=26). \nRhinorrhea was observed in 9 patients (29.0%). ASBF were most commonly seen in \ncompartment I, representing the frontal sinus region, in 24 patients (77.4%), \nfollowed by compartment III, representing the sphenoid sinus region, in 22 \npatients (71.0%), and compartment II, representing the fovea ethmoidalis and \ncribriform plate region, in 21 patients (67.7%). Although conditions such as \nskull base fracture displacement and the presence of pneumocephalus were \nnumerically higher in the patient group with rhinorrhea, they were not \nstatistically significant. In addition, the contribution of acetazolamide use \nand high body mass index values \u200b\u200bto the development of rhinorrhea in traumatic \nanterior skull base fractures was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: Traumatic ASBF are complicated due to conditions such as CSF \nfistula, intracranial hemorrhage, and meningitis, and should be managed with a \nmultidisciplinary approach. Traumatic anterior skull base fractures occur more \nfrequently in compartment 1. Numerous factors may influence the formation and \nduration of posttraumatic CSF fistula, and these factors should be assessed in \nlarger patient series."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "pancreatitis", "text": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a formidable \nmalignancy, with historically high morbidity and mortality following surgical \nresection. Over the past two decades, minimally invasive pancreatic resection \n(MIPR)-encompassing both laparoscopic and robotic approaches-has emerged as a \npromising alternative to conventional open techniques, offering potential \nadvantages in perioperative recovery while aiming to maintain oncologic \nstandards.\nOBJECTIVE: This review aims to synthesize the evidence guiding the adoption of \nMIPR for PDAC and to highlight technical innovations, training considerations, \nand future directions in this evolving field.\nMETHODS: A focused appraisal of key retrospective analyses, prospective \nrandomized trials, and meta-analyses was conducted. Emphasis was placed on \noncologic outcomes, perioperative morbidity, learning curve dynamics, and \npatient selection criteria.\nRESULTS: Overall, the studies reviewed suggest that MIPR can achieve equivalent \noncologic outcomes-specifically in margin status and lymph node yield-relative \nto open resection. Advantages include reduced intraoperative blood loss, shorter \nhospital stays, and faster functional recovery, most consistently demonstrated \nfor distal pancreatectomy. However, the technical complexity of minimally \ninvasive pancreatoduodenectomy necessitates structured training and high-volume \ncenters to mitigate safety concerns. Increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy also \nintersects with MIPR, necessitating careful patient selection and \nmultidisciplinary coordination.\nCONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive pancreatic resection has become a valid option \nfor patients with PDAC, particularly for distal lesions, and holds promise for \nbroader application pending further refinements. Rigorous training programs, \nthoughtful patient selection, and ongoing trials will be crucial to optimizing \noutcomes and solidifying MIPR as a mainstay in pancreatic cancer management."}

Exploring novel serum biomarkers and the \nunderlying mechanism is crucial for the early diagnosis and precise therapy of \nPDAC.\nMETHODS: Exosomal microRNAs (exo-miRNAs) isolated from serum samples of 92 PDAC \npatients and 44 healthy subjects were detected by small RNA sequencing, and \ntheir diagnostic performance and prognostic value were evaluated. In vitro \nexperiments and orthotopic PDAC mouse model were conducted to investigate the \neffect of miR-519a/522-5p. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics were used \nto explore the underlying mechanism of miR-519a/522-5p dysregulation.\nRESULTS: Compared with the healthy control, all three PDAC subgroups (stage \nI-III) displayed a specific deregulated serum exo-miRNA profile. A panel of 3 \nserum exo-miRNAs (let-7g-3p, miR-490-5p, and miR-519a/522-5p) was established as \nnovel diagnostic biomarkers for PDAC, which exhibited high sensitivity and \nspecificity in clinical cohort. MiR-519a/522-5p was found to be an independent \nprognostic factor for PDAC and associated with tumor features particularly \ninvasion/metastasis. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that \nmiR-519a/522-5p promoted invasiveness/metastasis of PDAC cells. Moreover, \nmiR-519a/522-5p could be effectively delivered via exosomes and increased the \ninvasiveness of recipient cancer cells. Multi-omics analysis showed a \ncomprehensive miR-519a/522-5p-regulated molecular network, in which glycolysis \nplayed a central role. We further validated that miR-519a/522-5p enhanced \nglycolysis by targeting SESN2.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum exo-miRNAs could be promising candidates for precise \ndiagnosis and treatment of PDAC. Exo-miR-519a/522-5p promotes PDAC cellular \ninvasiveness by enhancing Warburg effect through intercellular transportation."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "pancreatitis", "text": "While immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-ligand 1 \n(PD-L1) demonstrate clinical efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), tumor \ncells frequently evade immune surveillance through PD-L1 overexpression, a \nphenomenon whose regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Through \nintegrated analysis of single-cell transcription sequence data, we identified \naberrant upregulation of Lamin B2 (LMNB2) specifically in \nimmunotherapy-sensitive HCC patients. Functional characterization revealed that \nLMNB2 acts as a transcriptional regulator of PD-L1, potentiating immune escape \nmechanisms in HCC cells during co-culture with Jurkat cells. Notably, we \ndiscovered that speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) directly interacts with LMNB2 to \nmediate its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining \nphysiological PD-L1 expression levels. Clinically relevant SPOP mutations or \nreduced SPOP expression impaired this regulatory mechanism, leading to LMNB2 \naccumulation and subsequent PD-L1 hyperactivation. Importantly, combinatorial \ntargeting of LMNB2 with Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) displayed a synergistic \neffect on suppressing tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo, particularly \nin HCC models with SPOP mutations or LMNB2 overexpression.

While \nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling has been identified as an immune \ncheckpoint and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, its role in melanoma \nremains unexplored. This study investigated the impact of a novel VIP receptor \nantagonist, ANT308, on melanoma cell behavior and tumor growth. Using both \nmurine and human UVM/cutaneous melanoma cell lines, we examined the inhibition \nof VIP receptor signaling and its effects on cell migration and proliferation in \nvitro.

Knockdown of the VIP \nreceptor VPAC2 in mouse and human melanoma cells produced similar effects on \ncell migration, proliferation, and MCAM protein expression, further implicating \nVIP-VPAC2 signaling in tumor progression. In vivo studies revealed that ANT308 \ntreatment decreased MCAM expression in intraocular primary tumors, reduced the \nnumber and size of liver metastases following intraocular or subcutaneous \nmelanoma injection, and showed a trend toward reduced tumor volume at the \nprimary tumor site.

Additionally, \ncellular xenograft models of lenvatinib-resistant HCC were utilized to assess \ntumor responses to a novel drug treatment regimen. Our findings revealed a shift \nfrom suppression to activation in the expression of p-ERK1/2 and Cyclin D1 in \nHCC cells as they transitioned from sensitivity to resistance to lenvatinib. \nFurthermore, we demonstrated that targeting ERK1/2 with ravoxertinib (an ERK1/2 \ninhibitor) could significantly enhance the sensitivity of resistant HCC cells to \nlenvatinib therapy. Through transcriptome data analysis and experimental \nvalidation, we identified amphiregulin (AREG), induced autocrinely by \nlenvatinib, as a critical mediator that activates the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling \npathway, leading to increased Cyclin D1 expression in HCC cells. \nMechanistically, lenvatinib promotes aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) nuclear \ntranslocation, directly activating AREG transcription. Using in vivo models, we \nfurther confirmed that inhibiting ERK1/2 with ravoxertinib or AHR with CH-223191 \n(an AHR inhibitor) could overcome lenvatinib resistance in HCC. Overall, \nlenvatinib-induced AHR activation promotes AREG expression, which subsequently \nfacilitates the acquisition of drug resistance in HCC via the \nEGFR-ERK1/2-CyclinD1 signaling axis.

The present study aimed to explore gender \ndifferences in psychological characteristics and features associated with \nimpaired physical and mental quality of life in male and female patients \naffected by axial spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis.\nMETHODS: The present study is cross-sectional. Quality of life was evaluated \nusing a Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36), and \nphysical and mental component scores were presented. Data about disease \nactivity, anxiety and depression, fatigue, perceived stress, and coping \nstrategies were collected. The patients were stratified by gender, and clinical \nand psychological data were compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 119 patients with axial spondyloarthritis [age 49.0 (SD \n11.7); 45.4% F] and 198 patients with psoriatic arthritis [age 56.9 (SD 11.6); \n62.6% F] were included. Female patients with axial spondyloarthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis had worse scores on fatigue, pain, perceived stress, \nphysical quality of life, dysfunctional coping strategies, mental quality of \nlife (only in axial spondyloarthritis), and anxiety (only in psoriatic \narthritis) than men. In multivariable analysis, physical quality of life is \nmainly explained by fatigue and pain, and mental quality of life by fatigue, \nanxiety and stress in women with axial spondyloarthritis and psoriatic \narthritis. Fatigue, pain and anxiety were significant variables across the \nmodels with male patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that female patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis experience worse scores in \npsychological variables compared to men. Additionally, women's quality of life \nis significantly lower when compared to men's one, primarily due to factors such \nas fatigue, stress, pain, and anxiety. To enhance patient well-being, \ntherapeutic strategies should be tailored to address the unique clinical and \npsychological needs that arise from gender differences."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "psoriasis", "text": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with \nabnormalities in the immune system. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 \n(mPGES-1), a terminal enzyme for prostaglandin (PG) E2 biosynthesis, is highly \nexpressed in the skin of psoriasis patients. However, the detailed role of \nmPGES-1 in psoriasis remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to \ninvestigate the role of mPGES-1 in psoriasis-like skin inflammation induced by \nimiquimod (IMQ), a well-established model of psoriasis.\nMETHODS: Psoriasis was induced in mPGES-1-deficient (mPGES-1-/-) and wild-type \n(WT) mice by administering IMQ for 6\u00a0days. Psoriasis was evaluated based on the \nscores of the macroscopic symptoms, including skin scaling, thickness, and \nredness, and on the histological features. The skin expression of mPGES-1 was \ndetermined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The \nimpact of mPGES-1 deficiency on T-cell immunity was determined by flow cytometry \nand \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell depletion in vivo with anti-T-cell receptor (TCR) \u03b3\u03b4 antibody.\nRESULTS: The inflamed skin of mPGES-1-/- mice showed severe symptoms after the \nadministration of IMQ. Histological analysis further showed significant \nexacerbation of psoriasis in mPGES-1-/- mice. In WT mice, the mPGES-1 expression \nwas highly induced at both mRNA and protein levels in the skin, and PGE2 \nincreased significantly after IMQ administration, while the PGE2 production was \nlargely abolished in mPGES-1-/- mice. These data indicate that mPGES-1 is the \nmain enzyme responsible for PGE2 production in the skin. Furthermore, the lack \nof mPGES-1 increased the numbers of IL-17A-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the skin with \nIMQ-induced psoriasis, and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell depletion resulted in a reduction of the \nfacilitated psoriasis symptoms under the condition of mPGES-1 deficiency.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study results demonstrate that mPGES-1 is the main enzyme \nresponsible for skin PGE2 production, and that mPGES-1 deficiency facilitates \nthe development of psoriasis by affecting the development of T-cell-mediated \nimmunity. Therefore, mPGES-1 might impact both skin inflammation and \nT-cell-mediated immunity associated with psoriasis."}

Furthermore, \nresearch conducted to date has not consistently excluded women with chronic \nhypertension and/or kidney disease prior to pregnancy, indicating a possible \nselection bias. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of the updated \nliterature on renal outcomes in women who were healthy prior to pregnancy and \nexperienced pre-eclampsia.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase for eligible studies. We included \nretrospective and prospective studies involving healthy women with pre-eclampsia \nand reporting kidney outcomes. Of the 2,796 titles originally screened, 9 \nstudies met our inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analytic model was \nused for statistical analysis.\nRESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the risk of developing chronic \nkidney disease and end-stage kidney disease later in life following \npre-eclampsia was found (meta-analytic risk ratios [95% confidence interval]: \n1.83 [1.16-2.89] and 8.96 [4.94-16.23], respectively), with high statistical \nheterogeneity. However, the only prospective study did not find a significant \nassociation between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although a significant association was identified, its clinical \nrelevance and causality remain unclear. Postpartum medical investigation in \nwomen affected by pre-eclampsia is essential, but long-term follow-up may not be \nindicated in the absence of underlying conditions. Only prospective studies \ncould clarify the relationship between pre-eclampsia and kidney disease in women \nwho were healthy before pregnancy."}

Here, we show that \nADAMTS18/Adamts18 is significantly upregulated in the fibrotic kidneys of human \nCKD patients and mice. ADAMTS18 is primarily produced by renal tubular \nepithelial cells and fibroblasts during RF. Functionally, Adamts18 deletion \ninhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, and collagen \nsynthesis. Conversely, Adamts18 overexpression exacerbates progressive renal \nfibrosis. Mechanistically, the KPFR sequence in ADAMTS18 disrupts the \nlatency-associated peptide (LAP) interaction with TGF-\u03b2 and increases the \nrelease of mature TGF-\u03b21. Blockage of ADAMTS18-mediated latent TGF-\u03b2 activation \nby a tetrapeptide (LSKL) effectively reverses RF. Collectively, ADAMTS18 is a \nnovel LAP-TGF-\u03b21 activator with the potential to optimize CKD treatment \nstrategies."}

FFR was \nmeasured pre- and post-PCI with the goal of further optimization of the PCI \nresult based on post-PCI FFR. Target vessel revascularization (TVR) was \nevaluated in those with optimized FFR (\u22650.86) in the ISR and native vessel \nlesions.\nRESULTS: There were 675 lesions in 574 patients who underwent pre- and post-PCI \nFFR with 101 lesions with ISR. ISR group was more likely to present with acute \ncoronary syndrome and to have hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Both \ngroups had long to diffuse disease. Median pre-PCI stenosis (70\u00a0%, IQR 60-80\u00a0%) \nand pre-PCI FFR (0.69 vs 0.70) were similar in native and ISR groups. There was \nsimilar and modest correlation between angiographic severity and pre-PCI FFR in \nnative and ISR lesions (-0.57[-0.62 to -0.51] and -0.54 [-0.67 to -0.38], both \np\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Similar proportions of stenosis were functionally optimized to a \npost-PCI FFR \u22650.86 (66\u00a0% vs 71\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.7).

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "chronic kidney disease", "text": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), with sudden cardiac death (SCD) \nconstituting a primary cause of death, the molecular mechanisms of which are yet \nto be fully elucidated. Ubiquitin-specific protease 38 (USP38) has been \nimplicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. \nHowever, its role in CKD-related ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is yet to be \nclarified. This research systematically explores the involvement of USP38 in the \ndevelopment of VAs in CKD.\nMETHODS: This study employed cardiac-specific Usp38 knockout and transgenic \nUsp38 mice, along with H9c2 cells transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying \nUsp38 (AdUsp38) or shRNA targeting Usp38 (AdshUsp38). The mouse model was \ngenerated via 5/6 nephrectomy, and CKD cell models were created using indoxyl \nsulfate (IS) induction. These models underwent extensive evaluation, including \nechocardiography, electrophysiology, histological studies, and molecular \nanalysis.\nRESULTS: In CKD mouse models, USP38 expression was markedly elevated and \npredominantly localized in ventricular myocytes. Knocking out Usp38 markedly \ndecreased the susceptibility and duration of rapid VAs in CKD mice and corrected \nthe abnormal expression of ion channel proteins. Comparable findings were \nobserved in Usp38 transgenic mouse models. From a mechanistic perspective, Usp38 \nknockout reduced oxidative stress in cardiac tissues and upregulated \nantioxidative enzyme expression. The enhancement was mainly achieved by \nincreasing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) ubiquitination and degradation, along with \ninhibition of downstream CaMKII activity. In contrast, USP38 overexpression had \nharmful effects on the heart, which were alleviated by NOX4 inhibition.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that USP38 stabilizes NOX4 expression via \ndeubiquitination, resulting in increased oxidative stress and \nhyperphosphorylation of CaMKII, which markedly enhances the susceptibility of \nCKD mice to VAs. These findings underscore the critical regulatory role of USP38 \nin CKD-related arrhythmias, providing a promising therapeutic target for \nUSP38-directed treatments."}

A 2-stage revision is considered the 'gold standard' \nfirst-line treatment, but a 1-stage revision has become an increasingly viable \noption. Many small-sample, single-institution studies have looked at how patient \nfactors can affect the risk of failure of these first-line treatments. Few have \nlooked at a large, multi-institutional cohort to determine the significant risk \nfactors.\nMETHODS: Patients who have chronic knee PJIs were identified in a de-identified \nrecords database. Failure after first-line treatment was defined as the need for \nfurther surgery, such as irrigation and debridement, re-revision, amputation, or \narthrodesis, or the need for suppressive antibiotics. The five-year risk of \nfailure was evaluated for individual patient factors in order to identify \nvariables for a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Overall risk for \nthe individual measures of failure, as well as 90-day mortality, was also \nreported.\nRESULTS: Over five years after first-line treatment, 27.8% of 2-stage revisions \nfailed and 40.4% of 1-stage revisions failed. Treatment failure was seen more \ncommonly in patients who had prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \ninfection, a body mass index greater than or equal to 30, or a previous \ndiagnosis of depression. Those patients who underwent 2-stage revision surgeries \nfirst were more likely to fail with previous diagnoses of chronic kidney \ndisease, lymphedema, or resistance to other antimicrobials. Those patients who \nunderwent 1-stage revision surgeries were also more likely to fail if they had a \nprevious diagnosis of malnutrition.\nCONCLUSION: Orthopaedic surgeons should strongly consider patient comorbidities \nwhen selecting treatment pathways for PJIs."}

Participants who underwent \nfollow-up health examinations between 2011 and 2014 (N=2,728,675) were \nadditionally categorized by the combination of baseline and follow-up CVH \nscores.\nOUTCOME: A composite of a cardiovascular or kidney event. Cardiovascular events \nincluded myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and death from \nCVD. Kidney event included incident chronic kidney disease, kidney replacement \ntherapy, and death from kidney disease.\nANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cause-specific proportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 134,317 composite \ncardiovascular or kidney events occurred. Multivariable-adjusted risk of the \nevent decreased stepwise with higher CVH scores (for a CVH score of 6 vs. 0: HR \n0.32 [95% CI, 0.30-0.34]). An increase in CVH score from baseline (2009-2010) to \nfollow-up (2011-2014) examination was associated with lower risk of an event (HR \n0.86 [95% CI, 0.86-0.87] per +1 CVH score change). Moreover, the risk was lower \nin participants who maintained high CVH scores at both baseline and follow-up \nexaminations than in those who newly achieved a high CVH score at follow-up \nexamination (HR 0.87 [95% CI, 0.86-0.87] per +1 baseline CVH score).\nLIMITATIONS: Diet data were not included in CVH score.\nCONCLUSIONS: In young adults, achieving and maintaining high CVH were associated \nwith reduced risk of cardiovascular-kidney outcomes."}

This study \ninvestigates a novel screening approach utilizing pulse wave analysis combined \nwith machine learning models to identify CKD patients at high risk for coronary \natherosclerosis.\nMETHODS: We analyzed retrospective data from 124 CKD stage 5 patients who \nunderwent kidney transplantation. Pulse wave signals were collected using \nSphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia), and CAC scores were \ndetermined via CT scans. Machine learning models were developed using either \npulse wave features or traditional risk factors (TRF) to detect high CAC scores \n(\u2265100 Agatston units).\nRESULTS: The pulse wave-based model outperformed TRF-based model in identifying \nhigh CAC scores, particularly among younger patients. Specifically, the pulse \nwave-based classifier showed superior balanced accuracy in all analyzed age \ngroups and superior sensitivity in patients under 60 years old, especially in \nthose under 50 years old. The overall balanced accuracy of the pulse wave-based \nmodel exceeded 80\u00a0%, suggesting its potential as a reliable screening tool for \ndetecting high risk of coronary atherosclerosis in CKD patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pulse wave analysis combined with machine learning offers a \npromising, non-invasive method for preliminary CAC screening in CKD patients. \nThis approach could enhance early risk identification and improve clinical \nmanagement, although further research is needed to validate and refine this \nmethod in larger, more diverse populations."}

Machine learning (ML) enables predictive \nmodeling but its applicability to dental EHR data remains unclear. This study \nassessed the readiness of dental EHRs for predicting restoration failure using \nclassical and ML models.\nMETHODS: Data from the BigMouth Dental Data Repository was analyzed, focusing on \nposterior restorations in permanent molars of vital teeth. Failure was defined \nas root canal treatment or extraction within five years. Predictors included \nrestoration type, caries depth, number of surfaces filled, time to failure, age, \nand gender. Cox proportional hazards analysis and ML models compared amalgam and \ncomposite restorations.\nRESULTS: A total of 21,510 restorations placed between 2011 and 2020 across nine \nuniversities were identified. Both classical and ML analyses indicated superior \nfive-year survival for composite restorations. Classic survival analysis showed \na higher failure rate for amalgam (8.84 %) compared to composite (4.36 %). Among \nML survival models, Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox pH), Random Survival Forest \n(RSF), and DeepSurv, Cox pH had the highest Concordance Index (C-Index) at 0.64, \nwhile RSF and DeepSurv both achieved 0.63. RSF recorded the highest \nTime-Dependent Area Under Curve (0.620). Age, restoration type, and number of \nsurfaces filled were the most significant predictors of restoration survival.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that dental EHRs, in their current state, \nare not yet equipped to support accurate assessment and prediction of \nrestoration failure. ML models achieved only moderate predictive performance, \nlargely due to the absence of key clinical variables necessary for precise \nevaluation.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Gaps in dental EHR data limit the accuracy of ML-based \nrisk prediction. Enhancing diagnostic coding and data standardization can \nimprove predictive modeling, support evidence-based decision-making, and \noptimize treatment planning. Strengthening EHR documentation will enable \nArtificial Intelligence-driven tools to enhance clinical outcomes and advance \nprecision dentistry."}

Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and \nMcNemar tests were employed to identify significant differences between the \nscenarios. The P-value was set at 5%.\nRESULTS: A total of 435 undergraduates and 139 postgraduates from ten dental \nschools participated in this survey. The final survey included 401 responses \nfrom undergraduates and 127 from postgraduates for statistical analysis. When \nsymptoms were present, the majority of undergraduate and postgraduate students \npreferred non-selective (complete) caries removal over selective (partial) \ncaries removal in young patients. The majority of postgraduates preferred \npartial pulpotomy in younger patients and pulpectomy and root canal treatment \n(RCT) in older patients. The majority of undergraduates preferred pulpectomy and \nRCT in both young/old patients when symptoms were present. The majority of \nundergraduates and postgraduates opted for mineral trioxide aggregate and \nBiodentine, respectively, when treating the exposed pulp. Systemic antibiotics \nwere not recommended by both undergraduates and postgraduates, regardless of the \npatient's age and symptoms.\nCONCLUSION: Among the scenarios surveyed, the majority of undergraduates and \npostgraduates preferred: a) pulpectomy and RCT for older patients in the \npresence or absence of symptoms; b) hydraulic calcium silicate cements as pulp \ncapping material; and c) did not recommend systemic antibiotics.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: The majority of students choose non-selective (complete) \ncaries removal in all cases and if the pulp is exposed, the use of hydraulic \ncalcium silicate cements iwas the preferred material. Systemic antibiotics are \nconsidered unnecessary, irrespective of the patient's age and symptoms."}

This study evaluates the efficacy of deep \nlearning algorithms for detecting and diagnosing dental caries using cone-beam \ncomputed tomography (CBCT) with the Mask R-CNN architecture while comparing \nvarious hyperparameters to enhance detection.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,128 CBCT images were divided into training \nand validation and test datasets in a 7:1:1 ratio. For the verification of tooth \nrecognition, the data from the validation set were randomly selected for \nanalysis. Three groups of Mask R-CNN networks were compared: A scratch-trained \nbaseline using randomly initialized weights (R group); A transfer learning \napproach with models pre-trained on COCO for object detection (C group); A \nvariant pre-trained on ImageNetfor for object detection (I group). All \nconfigurations maintained identical hyperparameter settings to ensure fair \ncomparison. The deep learning model used ResNet-50 as the backbone network and \nwas trained to 300epoch respectively. We assessed training loss, detection and \ntraining times, diagnostic accuracy, specificity, positive and negative \npredictive values, and coverage precision to compare performance across the \ngroups.\nRESULTS: Transfer learning significantly reduced training times compared to \nnon-transfer learning approach (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The average detection time for group \nR was 0.269\u2009\u00b1\u20090.176 s, whereas groups I (0.323\u2009\u00b1\u20090.196 s) and C (0.346\u2009\u00b1\u20090.195 \ns) exhibited significantly longer detection times (p\u2009<\u20090.05). C-group, trained \nfor 200 epochs, achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 81.095, outperforming \nall other groups. The mAP for caries recognition in group R, trained for 300 \nepochs, was 53.328, with detection times under 0.5 s. Overall, C-group \ndemonstrated significantly higher average precision across all epochs (100, 200, \nand 300) (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: Neural networks pre-trained with COCO transfer learning exhibit \nsuperior annotation accuracy compared to those pre-trained with ImageNet. This \nsuggests that COCO's diverse and richly annotated images offer more relevant \nfeatures for detecting dental structures and carious lesions. Furthermore, \nemploying ResNet-50 as the backbone architecture enhances the detection of teeth \nand carious regions, achieving significant improvements with just 200 training \nepochs, potentially increasing the efficiency of clinical image interpretation."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "dental caries", "text": "BACKGROUND: Dental restorations play a very important role in maintaining oral \nfunction and aesthetics. However, the restoration's longevity is influenced by \nvarious factors, including material properties, classification of cavities, and \nclinical performance over time. Understanding why the restorations fail is \nessential not only for better treatment results but also for improving \ntheir\u00a0longevity. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) criteria provide a \ndetailed framework for assessing restoration performance in functional, \nbiological, and aesthetic aspects.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate clinical success and failure rates using \nFDI criteria for dental restorations based on tooth location, cavity type, and \nrestoration duration.\nMETHODS: A\u00a0retrospective cross-sectional clinical evaluation was conducted on \n230 restored teeth in patients treated with permanent composite restoration. \nRestorations were grouped by location (anterior or posterior), duration (\u22646 \nmonths, >6-12 months, >1-3 years, >3-5 years, >5 years), and cavity \nclassification (Classes I-V). Functional (fracture of material and retention, \nmarginal adaptation, proximal contact point), biological (caries at restoration \nmargin, dental hard tissue defects, post-operative sensitivity), and aesthetic \n(surface luster and texture, color match, marginal staining) parameters were \nevaluated. A statistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Product and \nService Solutions (SPSS, version 25; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, \nNY) to determine significant differences.\nRESULTS: The overall success rate was 30% (n=69), while 70% (n=161) experienced \nfailure. Success rates were comparable between anterior (29.2%, n=14) and \nposterior teeth (30.2%, n=55). Class I restorations had the highest success rate \n(42.4%, n=36), whereas Class V restorations showed the lowest (11.1%, n=1), with \na statistically significant association between cavity classification and \nrestoration longevity (p=0.012). Restoration success declined over time, with \nthose exceeding five years showing the highest failure rate (81.5%, n=22). \nFunctional evaluation showed a decline in fracture resistance and marginal \nadaptation over time, while biological assessment revealed an increase in \nsecondary caries. Aesthetic factors, including color match and marginal \nstaining, also worsened with time.\nCONCLUSION: Restoration longevity is influenced by cavity classification and \nduration of the restoration, with Class I restorations exhibiting superior \ndurability. The findings emphasize the progressive decline in functional, \nbiological, and aesthetic properties over time, stressing the need for improved \nrestorative materials and techniques to enhance long-term success."}

Statistical analysis included \nChi-square tests to compare the two groups.\nRESULTS: Among the cohort, females had higher rates of obesity (23.4\u202f% vs. \n8.5\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.049) and migraines (44.7\u202f% vs. 21.3\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.027). Females also had \nmore easy bruising (31.9\u202f% vs. 8.5\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.005), while dolichocephaly was more \ncommon in males (21.3\u202f% vs. 6.4\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Males had more aneurysms and \ndissections, including ascending aortic (89.4\u202f% vs. 72.3\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.036) and \nabdominal aortic aneurysms (34\u202f% vs. 10.6\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.006), and aneurysms in other \nlocations (63\u202f% vs. 42.6\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.048). Type A and B aortic dissections were \nalso more common in males (21.3\u202f% vs. 6.4\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Males had more aortic \nroot replacements (74.5\u202f% vs. 53.2\u202f%), while females had more tricuspid valve \nrepairs (19.1\u202f% vs. 2.1\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights significant gender differences in LDS, \nparticularly in vascular events and surgical interventions. Males are more \nlikely to experience aneurysms and dissections and undergo aortic root \nreplacement. These findings stress the importance of considering sex-based \nfactors in LDS management."}

Although numerous models have been developed, external \nvalidation studies determining the models' transportability beyond the original \nsettings are lacking. We aimed to assess the performance of two prediction \nmodels for post-stroke mortality in Berlin, Germany.\nDESIGN: We used data from the Berlin-SPecific Acute Treatment in Ischaemic or \nhAemorrhagic stroke with Long-term follow-up (B-SPATIAL) registry.\nSETTING: Multicentre stroke registry in Berlin, Germany.\nPARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted within 6 hours after symptom onset and \nwith a 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases discharge \ndiagnosis of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke or transient ischaemic attack \nat one of 15 hospitals with stroke units between 1 January 2016 and 31 January \n2021.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated calibration (calibration-in-the-large, \nintercept, slope and plot) and discrimination performance (c-statistic) of Bray \net al's 30-day mortality and Smith et al's in-hospital mortality prediction \nmodels. Information on mortality was supplemented by Berlin city registration \noffice records.\nRESULTS: For the validation of Bray et al's model, we included 7879 patients \n(mean age 75; 55.0% men). We observed 763 (9.7%) deaths within 30 days of stroke \ncompared with 680 (8.6%) predicted. The model's c-statistic was 0.865 (95% CI: \n0.851 to 0.879). For Smith et al's model, we performed the validation among 1931 \npatients (mean age 75; 56.2% men), observing 105 (5.4%) in-hospital deaths \ncompared with the 92 (4.8%) predicted. The c-statistic was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.864 \nto 0.918). The calibration plots of both models revealed an underestimation of \nthe mortality risk for high-risk patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among Berlin stroke patients, both models showed good calibration \nperformance for low and medium-risk patients and high discrimination while \nunderestimating risk among high-risk patients. The acceptable performance of \nBray et al's model in Berlin illustrates how a small number of routinely \ncollected variables can be sufficient for valid prediction of post-stroke \nmortality."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "migraine", "text": "Triptans are efficacious, largely prescribed antimigraine drugs but where and \nhow they exert their therapeutic effect is debated. Because of the presumed \nimpermeability of the blood brain barrier to triptans, a peripheral antimigraine \neffect of these drugs have been repeatedly proposed. Recent findings, however, \nindicate that triptans cross the blood brain barrier, and counteract central \nnociception in models of pronociceptive sensitization. Here, we investigated the \neffects of subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan in models of opioid withdrawal and \nopioid-induced hyperalgesia, two conditions sustained by deranged descending \nfacilitation by the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). We found that s.c. \nsumatriptan injection in morphine-dependent rats 30 min before \nnaloxone-precipitated withdrawal reduced severity of withdrawal symptoms. We \nalso found that at the time of naloxone injection sumatriptan reached contents \nof 294\u00b119 and 371\u00b130 pg/mg of tissue in the RVM and locus coeruleus, \nrespectively. In keeping with data on morphine withdrawal, s.c. sumatriptan \ninjections suppressed thermal hyperalgesia in rats undergoing repeated dosing of \nmorphine. Sumatriptan affected neither behavioral signs in morphine-dependent \nrats unexposed to naloxone, nor the extent of the initial antinociceptive \nresponse to morphine. Overall, data suggest that peripherally injected \nsumatriptan reaches CNS concentrations sufficient to exert functional \nneuromodulation of brainstem regions involved in pronociceptive sensitization \nand nociplasticity. PERSPECTIVE: This article reports that sumatriptan reduces \nsymptoms of morphine withdrawal and morphine-induced hyperalgesia.

Magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) morphometry plays a crucial role in identifying these \nalterations, yet the clinical significance remains debated. While gray matter \nvolume and cortical curvature are commonly analyzed, cortical thickness offers a \nmore direct measure of cytoarchitectural differences and neuroplastic changes in \nmigraine. Advanced structural MRI techniques, including surface-based \nmorphometry and voxel-based morphometry, have provided insights into cortical \nthickness alterations in migraine. These methods enable high-resolution \nassessment of brain morphometry, revealing dynamic changes associated with \nmigraine phases and treatment.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes findings \nfrom cortical thickness studies, focusing on methodological approaches, \nvariations in imaging sequences and study designs, including cross-sectional and \nlongitudinal studies.ResultsStudies using surface-based morphometry (i.e. SBM) \nand voxel-based morphometry (i.e. VBM) have reported inconsistent findings. \nIncreased thickness is frequently observed in pain-processing regions, such as \nthe somatosensory cortex, insula and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting \nhyperexcitability or maladaptive neuroplasticity. by contrast, cortical thinning \nhas been noted in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate \ncortex and visual cortex, suggesting neuronal loss or impaired cortical \nintegrity. Differences between episodic and chronic migraine further highlight \nprogressive structural changes associated with disease burden. Emerging evidence \nalso suggests that preventive treatments, including calcitonin gene-related \npeptide monoclonal antibodies and botulinum toxin A, may reverse some of these \ncortical alterations, particularly in treatment responders.ConclusionsCortical \nthickness analysis provides valuable insights into migraine pathophysiology, \noffering a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response. \nHowever, inconsistencies across studies highlight the need for standardized MRI \nprotocols and larger longitudinal investigations to clarify the clinical \nrelevance of cortical thickness changes in migraine."}

Managing treatment side effects and improving quality of life are \nimportant. While in-person dance programs have shown benefits, research on \nhome-based, theory-driven dance programs is limited. This study evaluated a \nhome-based, remote dance program using the biopsychosocial model to improve the \nquality of life in breast cancer patients and support its use in cancer care.\nMETHODS: The study was conducted from July 2023 to May 2024, carrying out online \nin each participant's home concurrently in Taiwan. A total of 66 breast cancer \npatients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n\u00a0=\u00a033) or a control \ngroup (n\u00a0=\u00a033). The experimental group participated in a weekly 60-min \nhome-based dance program, guided by the biopsychosocial model, for 12 weeks via \nonline software. The control group received standard care during this period. \nThe evaluation metrics included European Organization of Research and Treatment \nCancer-Quality of Life C30 and Breast Cancer 23 Questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30 \nand EORTC-QLQ-BR23) in the pre-and -post time during the intervention.\nRESULTS: Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed \nsignificant improvement in EORTC QLQ-C30 summary score (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03), symptoms \nsummary (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04), fatigue (p\u00a0=\u00a0.004), and EORTC QLQ-BR23 symptoms scales \n(p\u00a0=\u00a0.05) and breast symptoms scales (p\u00a0=\u00a0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study introduced a pioneering home-based remote dance program \nfor breast cancer patients, guided by the biopsychosocial model. The results \nshowed partial symptom relief and improved quality of life. It is recommended to \nincorporate this program, led by a professional instructor, into future breast \ncancer treatment plans."}

The study \naim was to investigate the distinct hemodynamic responses that occur at the \nprefrontal cortex (PFC) during yoga poses and PNF.\nMETHODS: Sixteen healthy young volunteers, aged 20-28 years, participated in two \nrandomly assigned sessions, i.e., nine testing rounds of PNF stretching and yoga \npostures, conducted on two consecutive days. To ensure uniformity in the \nsessions, each volunteer underwent a 30-day orientation of both PNF stretching \nand yoga postures prior to the testing rounds. We used functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy to record the blood flow responses of the right and left PFC at \nrest, during nine practice epochs, and after practice. Repeated measures \nanalysis of variance with 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 (Sessions\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0right and left PFC\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0States \nrespectively) was followed up with post-hoc analysis for oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and \ndeoxyhemoglobin (HbR).\nRESULTS: During PNF and yoga posture, there was significantly greater bilateral \nHbO in the prefrontal region of the brain. The results demonstrated improved PFC \nHbO from pre to during session (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both PNF and yoga sessions. \nHowever, there was a more rapid change in HbR during the PNF sessions compared \nto yoga.\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that yoga practice helps to maintain better \noxygenation levels and may prevent rapid deoxygenation, which can indicate less \nfatigue or stress on the brain. In contrast, the rapid deoxygenation seen during \nPNF sessions could be associated with increased muscular effort and fatigue, \nleading to lower oxygen retention in the prefrontal cortex."}

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) matched and analyzed the Census of \nFatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System \n(FARS) to describe work-related MVCs.\nMETHODS: BLS matched CFOI and FARS data for 2011-2014. The matching algorithm \nused a series of iterative matches allowing for increasing levels of \nflexibility. Descriptive epidemiologic analysis was conducted to examine \npotential risk factors for MVCs.\nRESULTS: Crashes: Information on 3,822 fatal work-related MVCs was successfully \nmatched. A collision (n\u00a0=\u00a03,156, 82.5%) was most often the first injury- or \ndamage-producing event. Collisions with motor vehicles in transport accounted \nfor 1,769 (46.5%) of crashes. Vehicles: The match identified 3,879 vehicles. \nOver half (53.6%) were large trucks. In most vehicles, one fatality (n\u00a0=\u00a03,657) \noccurred. Multiple worker fatalities per vehicle (n\u00a0=\u00a0203) were more common in \nheavy trucks (n\u00a0=\u00a059, 29.1%) and pick-up trucks (n\u00a0=\u00a036, 17.7%).\nPERSONS: The match identified 4,060 workers, 3,581 (88.2%) of whom were drivers. \nWorkers employed in transportation, warehousing, and utilities (38.2%) and \nservices (24.4%) accounted for most fatalities. Among passengers, the highest \nproportions were observed in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction \n(28.6%) and construction (20.0%). A small number of drivers were reported as \nimpaired by being asleep or fatigued (5.2%), under the influence of alcohol, \ndrugs, and medications (3.0%) or blacking out (1.8%). For 755 (21.1%) of the \n3,581 drivers, the investigating officer indicated that speed contributed to the \ncrash. Conclusions/Practical Applications: The CFOI/FARS matched data analysis \nprovides a fuller understanding of work-related MVCs, thus making it possible to \ndevelop focused crash prevention recommendations for workers who drive as part \nof their job."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "fatigue", "text": "OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to examine the post-effect of deep breathing warm-up \ntechniques on ventilatory capacity and inspiratory muscle endurance.\nMETHODS: In a randomized crossover design, fourteen active women performed four \ndifferent inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW) protocols followed by maximum \nvoluntary ventilation (MVV) and repeated inspiratory resistance breathing (RIRB) \ntests. Heart rate variability was also monitored before and after IMW. IMW \ntechniques included deep inspiration with normal expiration (DI), deep \ninspiration with short breath-holding (DI-H), deep inspiration with short \nbreath-holding followed by shallow breathing alternate (DI-H/SB), and deep \ninspiration and expiration (DI-DE). Each protocol was performed six breathing \ncycles per set for five sets, one-minute rest between sets.\nRESULTS: MVV and RIRB score were significantly increased by both protocols with \nbreath-holding (MVV: p = 0.002, p =0.021; RIRB p = 0.002, p= 0.002, in DI-H and \nDI-H/SB, respectively). Deep inspiration alone did not affect both parameters. \nOn the other hand, slow deep inspiration and deep expiration increased RIRB \nattempts (p = 0.020) without any effect on MVV value. Electrocardiogram \nindicated a significant decrease in RMSSD heart rate variability in deep \ninspiration with short breath-holding continuously (p = 0.043) and slow deep \ninspiration and deep expiration techniques (p = 0.032). However, a decrease was \nnot observed in the technique of deep/shallow breathing alternate.\nCONCLUSION: The data suggested that the addition of short breath-holding during \nIMW exerted significant stress on inspiratory muscles, which consequently \nactivated a higher tolerance to fatigue. Deep/shallow alternate breathing helped \nlessen the stress due to breath-holding."}

Spinal fluid \ndrainage (SFD) is used to reduce SCI risk in open surgery; however, many \nquestion the safety of SFD in endovascular repair. The objective of this \nretrospective study was to review the risks of prophylactic spinal fluid \ndrainage in 1445 patients undergoing open and endovascular TAA and TAAA repair \nfrom 1987 to 2023.\nMETHODS: Spinal drains were placed in open TAAA repairs and endovascular repairs \nplanning >12cm aortic coverage. Cardiac anesthesiologists placed and managed all \ndrains. From 2000-2023 spinal drains for elective surgery were placed using \nfluoroscopic guidance. Spinal fluid was drained to <5-8 mmHg depending on SCI \nrisk. If bloody fluid appeared, drainage was stopped and head CT obtained. \nDrainage was stopped when patient demonstrated normal leg strength; drains were \nremoved at 48 hours if leg strength was normal. Post-SFD headache was treated \nwith blood patch. We tracked intraoperative fluid drained, neurologic \ncomplications from SFD (any neurologic deficit from intracranial or spinal \nhematoma), bloody spinal fluid, intracranial blood on head CT without neurologic \ndeficit, headache requiring blood patch, transient SCI (paraparesis/paraplegia), \nand permanent SCI (paraparesis/paraplegia).\nRESULTS: Of the 1445 patients (1029 open, 416 endovascular) undergoing TAA/TAAA \nrepair, 1007 (777 open, 230 endovascular) had SFD. Before 2000, 263 open repairs \ndone with smaller drains had an average of 125mls of fluid drained \nintraoperatively to achieve pressure goals. From 2000-2023 intraoperative SFD to \nachieve pressure goals averaged 132mls in open and 81mls in endovascular \nrepairs. Six patients (0.6%) had neurologic complications from SFD; 5 of these \n(0.77%) occurred in open patients. Only 1 patient having endovascular repair had \na neurologic complication from SFD (0.43%). From 2000-2023 other events not \nresulting in neurologic deficit included bloody spinal fluid (20.7% open; 21.7% \nendovascular); intracranial blood on CT without neurologic deficit (9.9% open; \n6.1% endovascular); and headache requiring blood patch (7.6% open; 11.7% \nendovascular). From 2000-2023 5.6% of open patients had transient SCI; 4.2% had \npermanent SCI. 3.6% of endovascular patients had transient SCI; 1.2% had \npermanent SCI.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic SFD can be performed with acceptable risk in both \nendovascular and open TAAA repair. We advocate that prophylactic SFD be used to \nreduce risk of SCI in both endovascular and open TAAA repair."}

Dunal (WS) as a chemoprophylactic and immunomodulatory agent against \nSARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMETHODS: In a 12 week, randomized, open label, parallel group, two arm, \ncomparative, multicentric, controlled trial compared WS with hydroxychloroquine \n(HCQ) in health care workers (HCWs). Total 400 HCWs were randomized in 1:1 ratio \nto receive either oral WS (500\u00a0mg for 12 weeks) or HCQ 400\u00a0mg (for 7 weeks). The \nprimary outcome was to establish equivalence between WS and HCQ for the \nproportion of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nRESULTS: Seven participants contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection: 5 in WS arm and 2 \nin HCQ arm. The equivalence between WS and HCQ was established for the \nproportion difference of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection for \nper-protocol (PP) (1.6%, 95% CI: -1.08%-4.33%) and in subgroup analysis (ITT, \nmIIT, non-vaccinated and seronegative). Notably, the immunomodulatory effect of \nWS stood scientifically validated by the statistically significant difference in \ncytokine levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) at 12 weeks compared to baseline for Tumor Necrosis \nFactor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17 and Monocyte \nchemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were most \nfrequent (53 in WS and 58 in HCQ). Headache and sneezing were observed only with \nHCQ. Participant global assessment showed excellent tolerability with both \ntreatment arms.\nCONCLUSION: WS was found equivalent to HCQ as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection with no safety concern. WS is thus inferred to be an effective and \nsafe Ayurvedic intervention for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and \nalso as an immunobooster."}

However, many symptoms are non-specific and there is \nconsiderable variation in symptom reporting. It is essential to understand how \nrates of these symptoms compare to the pre-pandemic health of adolescents.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of academic literature and websites, using \ntraditional and automated search systems, was undertaken to identify symptoms \ndescribed in adolescents aged 10-19\u2009years in the 30\u2009years up to and including \n2019. Studies were reviewed and symptom prevalence data extracted.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five sources (n\u2009=\u2009483\u2009097 participants) met the inclusion \ncriteria, including longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs. The \ndescription and prevalence of symptoms varied widely, but there was a high \npre-pandemic median prevalence of cough (13.6%), headache (30.0%), and fatigue \n(20.5%). These high prevalences highlight a gap in understanding of pre-pandemic \nadolescent health and the need for comprehensive, serial symptom profiling.\nCONCLUSION: These findings provide a baseline of adolescent symptomatology prior \nto the emergence of PCC and provide important context for interpreting ongoing \nCOVID symptoms. Data on PCC in adolescents should consider pre-pandemic symptom \nprevalence."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "headache", "text": "BACKGROUND: Pineal cysts are benign lesions found in 1-4% of the population. \nWhile surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms related to hydrocephalus \nor signs of tectal compression, most patients present with non-specific symptoms \nsuch as headaches, psychiatric disturbances, sleep dysregulation, dizziness, and \nfatigue, among others, where the role for surgery remains unclear. Although the \netiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is \nanatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to \nthese symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and \nneurotransmitter regulation.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent pineal cyst \nresection at our center between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients \npresenting with hydrocephalus or concomitant conditions were excluded.\nRESULTS: Seven female patients (median age 27, range 19-42) were analyzed. The \nmost common preoperative symptom was headaches, present in all patients, \nfollowed by fatigue, dizziness, memory problems, and psychiatric symptoms. \nPostoperatively, 85.7% (6/7) had complete headache resolution, while one (14.3%) \nhad partial relief. Cognitive symptoms, including memory and concentration \nproblems, improved in 66.6% (2/3) of cases, and psychiatric symptoms improved in \n66% (4/6). The median follow-up was 24 months, with no new neurological deficits \nat the final follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection can lead to significant improvements in \nnon-specific symptoms including headaches, psychiatric disturbances, and \ncognitive issues in a subset of pineal cyst patients with severe refractory \nsymptoms. These findings support the role of surgical intervention for such \ncarefully selected patients and highlight the need for further investigation \ninto the pathophysiology of these symptoms."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "headache", "text": "Triptans are efficacious, largely prescribed antimigraine drugs but where and \nhow they exert their therapeutic effect is debated. Because of the presumed \nimpermeability of the blood brain barrier to triptans, a peripheral antimigraine \neffect of these drugs have been repeatedly proposed. Recent findings, however, \nindicate that triptans cross the blood brain barrier, and counteract central \nnociception in models of pronociceptive sensitization. Here, we investigated the \neffects of subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan in models of opioid withdrawal and \nopioid-induced hyperalgesia, two conditions sustained by deranged descending \nfacilitation by the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). We found that s.c. \nsumatriptan injection in morphine-dependent rats 30 min before \nnaloxone-precipitated withdrawal reduced severity of withdrawal symptoms. We \nalso found that at the time of naloxone injection sumatriptan reached contents \nof 294\u00b119 and 371\u00b130 pg/mg of tissue in the RVM and locus coeruleus, \nrespectively. In keeping with data on morphine withdrawal, s.c. sumatriptan \ninjections suppressed thermal hyperalgesia in rats undergoing repeated dosing of \nmorphine. Sumatriptan affected neither behavioral signs in morphine-dependent \nrats unexposed to naloxone, nor the extent of the initial antinociceptive \nresponse to morphine. Overall, data suggest that peripherally injected \nsumatriptan reaches CNS concentrations sufficient to exert functional \nneuromodulation of brainstem regions involved in pronociceptive sensitization \nand nociplasticity. PERSPECTIVE: This article reports that sumatriptan reduces \nsymptoms of morphine withdrawal and morphine-induced hyperalgesia. Data suggests \nthat triptans exert their antinociceptive effects through central mechanisms."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "abdominal pain", "text": "BACKGROUND: The transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle plays a crucial role in \nlumbar spine stability and core strength. Activation of the TrA is commonly \nachieved through the abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM). Dysfunction in the \ndeep abdominal muscles is often linked to low back pain and instability. The \nADIM technique involves drawing the navel inward toward the spine while \nmaintaining a neutral spine position and normal breathing, thereby engaging the \nTrA. Sphygmomanometer is a valuable tool for measuring muscle activation, \ntracking changes in pressure, and ensuring core stability and strength during \ntraining.\nMETHODOLOGY: This narrative review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A search \nacross PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and MEDLINE included \nstudies (2010-2024) on ADIM training for TrA activation using a \nsphygmomanometer. RCTs, observational and Systematic review were included. The \nPEDro scale assessed study quality, and two independent reviewers conducted data \nextraction and analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of sixteen studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0833) demonstrated the effectiveness of \nADIM training in activating the TrA muscle, with the sphygmomanometer providing \nhigh reliability (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.995-0.999) in assessing muscle activation. This review \nemphasizes the importance of proper training techniques, including visual cues, \nand biofeedback, to ensure optimal engagement of the deep abdominal muscles.\nCONCLUSION: ADIM training is a highly effective strategy for activating the TrA \nmuscle and improving core stability. Sphygmomanometer provides a reliable and \nobjective measurement of muscle strength and activation. Therefore, ADIM should \nbe integrated into rehabilitation and training programs aimed at enhancing core \nfunction and preventing low back pain."}

Outcomes included assessment of clinical response at day 14 \nafter initiation of fidaxomicin treatment and clinical and microbiologic \noutcomes at day 60 after initiation of fidaxomicin treatment in the initial \nresponders.\nRESULTS: Of the 95 patients included in this study, 84 (88.4%) were treated with \nfidaxomicin for a rCDI, and 82 (86.3%) had at least one medical or surgical \ncomorbidity. At the completion of fidaxomicin treatment (ie, by day 14 after \ninitiation), 50 patients (52.6%) had a clinical cure and an additional 29 \n(30.5%) had improvement of symptoms.

A cross-sectional survey was \nadministered to final-year medical students from six universities located in \nNorthern, Central, and Southern Italy between May and July 2024. The \nquestionnaire (16 items) assessed the students' knowledge and attitudes toward \nacute pain management in pediatric patients. Descriptive and inferential \nstatistics were used to analyze the data. A total of 321 students completed the \nsurvey. The majority (49%) of students reported limited training (<\u20091\u00a0h) in \npediatric pain management during their studies.\u00a0Only 42% of respondents believed \nthat neonates feel pain more intensively than adults, while 38% thought the same \nfor children up to 3 years. old While 81% recognized that pediatric pain can be \nmeasured with age-specific tools, 60% would avoid using opioids for severe pain \nin children.

Adhesiolysis along the deformed \npelvic sidewall may increase the risk of prolonged operative time and incidental \nureteral injury. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and surgical outcomes \nof using Indocyanine Green (ICG) under near-infrared fluorescence for \nintraoperative ureteral localization and preservation during robot-assisted \nlaparoscopic surgery (RALS) for advanced endometriosis, comparing procedures \nperformed by two junior surgeons to those performed by one senior surgeon. This \nwas a retrospective observational case series conducted by three minimally \ninvasive gynecologic surgeons (X.G., T.K., B.T.) at a single tertiary care \ncenter between August 2021 and January 2025. A total of 92 patients underwent \nRALS using ICG fluorescence; 44 surgeries were performed by two junior surgeons, \nand 48 by a senior surgeon. The senior group had a higher percentage of patients \nwith complete cul-de-sac obliteration (56.3% vs. 18.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Our primary \nsurgical outcome, total operative time, was 233\u00a0min in the junior group and \n348\u00a0min in the senior group, initially showing a significant difference. \nHowever, after adjusting for factors such as history of prior abdominal surgery, \ncul-de-sac obliteration, and additional procedures (resection of ovarian \nremnant, bowel shaving, oophorectomy, enterolysis) using multivariable linear \nregression analysis, no significant difference was observed between the two \ngroups. Other perioperative outcomes-including patient characteristics, \nestimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain at weeks \n1, 2, and 3-were comparable between the groups. Complication rates did not \ndiffer significantly. Notably, there were no cases of temporary or permanent \nureteral injury in either group. These findings suggest that with ICG-assisted \nureteral mapping, junior surgeons can achieve comparable surgical outcomes to \nsenior surgeons. ICG facilitates intraoperative ureter identification, with the \npotential to enhance surgical safety by improving surgical precision and \nsupporting the training of junior surgeons in managing complex endometriosis."}

This study evaluated the impact of \n40% versus 100% inspired oxygen (FiO\u2082) on POD incidence, neuroinflammation, and \nclinical outcomes in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.\nMETHODS: In this trial, 160 elderly patients scheduled for major abdominal \nsurgery under general anesthesia from 2022 to September 2023 were randomly \nassigned to receive 40% FiO\u2082 (n\u2009=\u200980) or 100% FiO\u2082 (n\u2009=\u200980). The primary outcome \nwas POD incidence within 3 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included \nperioperative oxygenation parameters, plasma neuroinflammatory markers, \npulmonary infections, pain scores, and hospitalization duration. Blood samples \nwere collected preoperatively and postoperatively for biomarker analysis.\nRESULTS: Among 154 analyzed patients, POD incidence was 5.2% (8/154), with no \nsignificant difference between 40% FiO\u2082 (6.4%, 5/78) and 100% FiO\u2082 (3.9%, 3/76) \ngroups (P\u2009=\u20090.72). The 40% FiO\u2082 group exhibited lower saturation of pulse \noxygen, regional cerebral oxygen saturation, and arterial partial pressure of \noxygen from 1\u00a0h post-anesthesia (T2) to anesthesia end (T5) (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Electronic databases were searched in \nFebruary 2025. Clinical studies that meet the criteria were included in the \npresent study.\nRESULTS: Totally 116 cases were analyzed in this study, including 1 case in our \ncenter and 115 cases from 45 studies. The cohort included 82 males (70.7%) and \n34 females (29.3%), with ages ranging from 10 months to 18 years. The main \nclinical manifestations were fever (79.3%), respiratory symptoms (41.4%), and \nneurological symptoms (39.7%), followed by hepatosplenomegaly (35.3%), rash \n(27.6%), lymphadenopathy (18.1%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (16.4%). The \nmost commonly affected organs were the lungs (77.6%), central nervous system \n(53.4%), and lymph nodes (51.7%). Immunodeficiency was present in 12.9% of \nchildren (3.4% domestic cases vs. 9.5% foreign cases). Elevated eosinophils were \nobserved in 43 patients (37.1%), and elevated IgE levels in 35 patients (30.2%). \nThe most common pathogen-positive specimens were cerebrospinal fluid (54 cases, \n46.6%), blood cultures (49 cases, 42.2%), lymph node biopsies (26 cases, 22.4%), \nbone marrow (18 cases, 15.5%), and skin samples (8 cases, 6.9%).

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "fever", "text": "INTRODUCTION: Post-Chikungunya virus chronic arthritis (PCCA) is a debilitating, \npersistent and recurrent polyarthralgia. Older adults are the most physically \naffected population, but no previous study biomechanically described the PCCA \nimpairments on middle-aged people.\nMETHOD: The study aims to assess subjective pain scores, handgrip strength, \nbalance and temporospatial gait parameters on middle-aged people compared to \nolder adults, both with PCCA. Participants were split in 2 groups with PCCA: \nmiddle-aged adults (n\u00a0=\u00a047) and older adults (n\u00a0=\u00a030). The grip strength, gait \nand balance parameters, and pain perception were assessed.\nRESULTS: No between-group differences were found for balance variables, nor for \nhandgrip strength or pain perception. Almost all temporospatial gait parameters \nshowed differences across both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that middle-aged adults have the same levels \nof constraints than older adults on their balance, strength, and pain. However, \nthey were consistently better at all gait parameters compared to the older \nadults' group."}

We aim to \ndiscuss these findings through a systematic review.\nMETHODS: Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, PubMed, Medline, Google \nScholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase were systematically searched up to \nFebruary 2025. The search strategy was described by a combination of relevant \nmedical subheadings and keywords. Eligible English language studies were \nreviewed, and their quality was appraised. This review followed the Preferred \nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\nRESULTS: A total of 37 studies, including 1527 participants, met the inclusion \ncriteria. The most frequent etiology was infection, including both bacterial and \nviral infections (n\u00a0=\u00a01124). The most frequent symptoms were cough (reported in \n24 out of 26 studies) and fever (reported in 20 out of 26 studies). The most \nprevalent imaging findings were atelectasis (reported in 18 out of 23 studies), \nconsolidation (reported in 16 out of 23 studies), and pleural effusion (reported \nin 16 out of 23 studies). The combination of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and \nbronchoscopic cast removal was common among all the studies. The symptoms of PB \nwere resolved in most children (82.7\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a0525) after treatment, and the \nsymptoms recurred in 8.0\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a051) of patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review discovered the frequency of various \netiologies, clinical presentations, imaging findings, treatment approaches, and \noutcomes of PB in children.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "fever", "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral \ninfectious disease caused by a novel Bandavirus in the family Phenuiviridae. The \nSFTS virus (SFTSV) is transmitted to various hosts, including humans, through \ntick bites, leading to high fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, with a high \ncase fatality rate (up to 30%) due to multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, \nearly diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing disease \ntransmission. In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize monoclonal \nantibodies targeting the SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). We generated \nrecombinant NP to screen antibodies against SFTSV. Using phage display \ntechnology, we identified candidate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) \nsequences capable of detecting SFTSV NP. Five human IgG antibodies and six \nchimeric mouse antibodies exhibited strong binding ability to the recombinant \nNP. Furthermore, their specificity and selectivity were evaluated against NPs \nfrom different subtypes and other viral species. A sandwich enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine optimal antibody pairings \nfor SFTSV detection. The mP01A05/hP01C09, mP01A05/hP01B10, and mP02E04/hP01A05 \nantibody pairs demonstrated high efficacy in diagnosing SFTSV infections. These \nfindings provide valuable antibody resources and establish an effective platform \nfor the diagnosis of SFTS. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Monoclonal antibodies targeting SFTSV \nNP were developed using phage display technology. \u2022 Candidate antibodies showed \nstrong binding ability and high specificity to SFTSV NP. \u2022 Optimized antibody \npairs enabled effective SFTSV detection via sandwich ELISA."}

Preliminary evidence of content and construct validity has been \npreviously demonstrated, but only in SVT patients in the U.S. and Poland. The \naim of this study was to further evaluate the concurrent validity of the PPAQ in \npatients having a variety of arrhythmias and to explore whether differences in \nsymptoms existed by gender.\nMETHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional study, adult cardiac arrhythmia outpatients \nfrom a tertiary care, academic medical center completed the 6-item PPAQ, the \nSF-12, a Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), \nand the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Included were patients with atrial \nfibrillation (82.4%), ventricular tachycardia (15.7%), and atrial tachycardia \n(2%). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, pairwise comparisons with \nPearson correlations, Goodman Kruskal gamma statistic for ordinal associations, \nCronbach's alpha, and Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) were used to determine \nconcurrent construct validity and internal consistency reliability.\nRESULTS: Participants (n=51) had a mean age of 59.4 years (\u00b1 12.6), were \nmajority male (66.7%) and Caucasian (75%). Preliminary evidence of concurrent \nconstruct validity was found based on moderate to strong correlations (range \nfrom 0.4 to 0.7) between the PPAQ and other validated measures, as well as \nstrong internal reliability (KR-20 of 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.91). The \nmost common symptoms reported were fatigue (60.8%) and heart fluttering (52.9%). \nBlurred vision (p<0.04), dizziness (p<0.01), and fatigue (p<0.04) were seen \nsignificantly more frequently in men compared to women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results present additional evidence of the validity and reliability \nof the PPAQ. The PPAQ comprehensively measures the burden of the disease from \ncardiac arrhythmia patients' perspective.

However, many existing \nlightweight methods struggle to achieve satisfactory performance due to the \naggressive reduction in the number of parameters. Therefore, to improve the \nperformance of lightweight networks, we propose a novel global feature prior \nself-attention network. First, conventional window-based self-attention methods \ntypically apply attention mechanisms indiscriminately to all pixels within a \nwindow. This can lead to artifacts and texture blurring. To mitigate this issue, \nwe leverage prior knowledge to identify texture-related pixels within the window \nand perform self-attention operations specifically on these pixels. Second, to \nenhance the network's ability to capture critical information and structural \ndetails, we introduce an efficient global feature extraction method. Finally, \nwhile transformers excel at capturing global features and low-frequency \ninformation, they often struggle with extracting local features and \nhigh-frequency information. Therefore, we integrate a local complementary module \ninto the shift window attention to compensate for the transformer's shortcomings \nin extracting local and high-frequency features. Extensive experiments \ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all other state-of-the-art \nlightweight approaches.

The giant CCs of the cavum \nseptum pellucidum (CSP) are located in the hard-to-reach areas of the brain, and \nthey can be removed microsurgically and endoscopically. At present, the \ntransition from the microsurgical resection to the endoscopic is observed, and \nresearchers demonstrate several benefits of the endoscopic resection over the \nmicrosurgical. We noticed the absence of research illustrating the endoscopic \nresection of the giant CC of the CSP. Therefore, we decided to demonstrate a \nrare case performed in our hospital.\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient was a 57-year-old male who had suffered from \ndizziness, headache, nausea, urinary incontinence, short-term forgetfulness, \ngait ataxia, cognitive decline, and vision blurring. The eventual diagnosis of \nthe giant CC in the CSP was established, and it was complicated by occlusive \nhydrocephalus and headache syndrome. The endoscopic resection of the giant CC in \nthe septum pellucidum was performed using the endoscopic transseptal approach.\nCONCLUSION: No complications were observed in the postoperative period. The \ntumor was removed completely, no recurrence was noted, and only a capsule of the \ntumor was observed in the control magnetic resonance imaging image taken 3 \nmonths after the operation. Considering these results, we conclude that \nendoscopic removal may have positive and safe outcomes as the surgical treatment \nmethod for the giant CCs located in the septum pellucidum."}

We \nreport a case of bilateral adenoviral vasculitis progressing to peripheral \nnecrotizing retinitis in an immunocompromised patient with newly diagnosed HIV, \nemphasizing the role of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis and \nmultimodal antiviral therapy.\nMETHODS: A 33-year-old male, recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 count: 158/\u00b5L), \npresented with floaters and blurred vision. Fundus examination revealed \nbilateral peripheral occlusive vasculitis with blot hemorrhages and macular \nedema. Anterior chamber fluid analysis via PCR revealed a high viral load of \nhuman adenovirus (HAdV) and tested negative for other common viral causes of \nretinal necrosis. Initial treatment involved topical corticosteroids, \nintravitreal ganciclovir, and systemic valganciclovir. Due to disease \nprogression, therapy was subsequently escalated to high-dose valacyclovir (2\u2009g \nTID) with intravitreal ganciclovir and later intravenous cidofovir was \nintroduced.\nRESULTS: Despite initial worsening, the addition of cidofovir resulted in \ngradual lesion resolution over 4\u00a0weeks, leaving peripheral retinal necrosis. The \nfinal best-corrected visual acuity improved to 6/6 (right eye) and 6/8 (left \neye), with residual macular ischemia. Concurrent antiretroviral therapy led to \nimmune reconstitution with an increase in CD4 counts to 580/\u00b5L. Notably, a \ndistinctive pattern of schisis-associated macular edema (SAME) was observed.\nCONCLUSION: Adenoviral necrotizing retinitis remains an underrecognized entity, \nparticularly in immunocompromised patients. This case underscores the importance \nof PCR testing for HAdV in atypical necrotizing retinitis and highlights the \nneed for a combined treatment approach, including systemic and intravitreal \nantiviral therapy."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "blurred vision", "text": "Infectious uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, corresponding to the \nmiddle layer of the eye, triggered by a response against an infectious agent. \nThis condition is classified into anterior, intermediate, posterior and \npanuveitis. The most frequent infectious agents in anterior uveitis are viruses, \nmainly Herpes simplex virus, although it can also be caused by other pathogens \nsuch as Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Fusarium spp. In \nintermediate uveitis, syphilis plays a predominant role, while in posterior \nuveitis various microorganisms are involved, among them Toxoplasma gondii, \nCytomegalovirus, Plasmodium spp. and Candida spp. In certain cases, as in ocular \ntoxoplasmosis, severe inflammation may involve the entire uvea, resulting in \npanuveitis. Clinical manifestations of uveitis include ocular pain, redness, \nmyodesopsias, blurred vision, and even loss of vision. Direct identification of \nthe causative agent is complex, and the diagnostic performance of available \ntests varies significantly. For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on \nocular specimens for Herpes simplex virus has a sensitivity of 91.3% and \nspecificity of 98.8%, while for toxoplasmosis the sensitivity is 43.1% and \nspecificity 98.5%. Another challenge in infectious uveitis is treatment, as \nsystemic antimicrobials generally have a low penetration into ocular tissue, \nmostly less than 5%, mainly due to the blood-retinal and blood-aqueous barriers. \nThe efficacy of the molecules in ocular tissue is favored by low protein binding \nand high liposolubility. This review addresses the most frequent clinical \nmanifestations of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal etiologies of \ninfectious uveitis, as well as the diagnostic performance of available tests. In \naddition, emphasis is placed on the different therapeutic approaches depending \non the etiology."}

In the current report, we provide the \nresults of the final analysis of overall survival, including updated data on \nefficacy and safety.\nRESULTS: A total of 161 patients were assigned to the inavolisib group, and 164 \nto the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 34.2 months in the inavolisib \ngroup and 32.3 months in the placebo group, the median overall survival was 34.0 \nmonths (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.4 to 44.8) with inavolisib and 27.0 \nmonths (95% CI, 22.8 to 38.7) with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% \nCI, 0.48 to 0.94; P\u2009=\u20090.02 [prespecified boundary for statistical significance, \nP<0.0469]). An objective response occurred in 62.7% (95% CI, 54.8 to 70.2) of \npatients in the inavolisib group and 28.0% (95% CI, 21.3 to 35.6) of those in \nthe placebo group (P<0.001).

Upon \npresentation, the right eye vision was 6/60 pinhole 6/36, with the presence of a \nrelative afferent pupillary defect. An anterior segment examination revealed \nright eye ciliary injection and corneal edema, with anterior chamber cells and \nfibrin. The right eye intraocular pressure (IOP) was 52 mmHg, and gonioscopy \nshowed an open angle with rubeosis at the angle. The right eye fundus revealed a \nglaucomatous optic disc with a 0.7 cup-to-disc ratio,\u00a0multiple dot-blot \nhemorrhages over the mid-peripheral retina, and narrowed retinal arteries \nsuggesting ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). The left eye examination was \nunremarkable. The diagnosis was further confirmed by fundus fluorescein \nangiography, which showed a marked delay in arterio-venous transit time with a \nprofound area of capillary fall-out at the peripheral retina. To tackle the \nischemic component, a pan-retina photocoagulation laser was conducted. Topical \nand systemic antiglaucoma medications, topical steroids, and cycloplegics were \ncommenced. He subsequently required a glaucoma drainage device in his right eye \nto control the IOP. He was investigated for the cause of OIS. Ultrasound carotid \nDoppler and computed tomography angiography of carotid arteries revealed \nbilateral internal carotid artery atherosclerotic disease with less than 50% \nstenosis. Double antiplatelet therapy was commenced to reduce the risk of \ncerebrovascular and cardiovascular events.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "blurred vision", "text": "PURPOSE: It remains unknown whether choroidal circulation could be altered at \nthe onset of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) uveitis compared with that before \nICI treatment. Herein we report a patient with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) \ndisease-like uveitis in the unaffected eye as an immune-related adverse effect \n(irAE) due to ICIs for metastatic choroidal melanoma who had received \nenucleation. Moreover, choroidal circulation and choroidal thickness were \nmeasured before and after treatment.\nMETHODS: A 58-year-old man had a medical history of enucleation in his left eye \ndue to choroidal melanoma 6 years ago. Metastatic lesions in the \ngastrointestinal tracts and lung were found, and then he received ICIs three \ntimes. About 1 month later, he suffered from blurred vision and metamorphopsia \nin his right eye. Choroidal circulation was evaluated by mean blur rate (MBR), a \nrelative value showing choroidal blood velocity on laser speckle flowgraphy. \nCentral choroidal thickness (CCT) was measured on optical coherence tomography.\nRESULTS: Since ophthalmic findings revealed VKH-like uveitis, oral prednisolone \nof 30 mg was given for 2 weeks, which were then tapered. MBR was reduced and CCT \nincreased at the onset of ICI uveitis compared with its baseline and resolution \nafter corticosteroid treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Choroidal circulation was disrupted, possibly due to ICI-induced \nautoinflammatory reaction to the choroid, which was managed by corticosteroid \ntreatment. The combination of MBR and CCT could be a useful biomarker for \nmanaging the patients with VKH-like uveitis by ICIs."}

Humphrey visual field testing, full-field \nelectroretinography (ERG), and multifocal ERG were analyzed. Baseline features \nand the natural course of the disease were delineated.\nRESULTS: Thirty-eight eyes from 23 patients were analyzed. Presenting symptoms \nincluded photopsia (87%), blurred vision (57%), and scotoma (57%). On \nophthalmoscopy, AOR was acutely characterized by yellow-greyish outer retinal \nlesions corresponding to hyperautofluorescent changes on FAF and the angular \nsign of Henle fiber layer hyperreflectivity (ASHH) on OCT. FAF imaging revealed \nring-like hyperautofluorescent lesions surrounding the optic disc in 18% of \neyes. Additional lesion patterns on FAF included perivenular (53%), sectoral \n(16%), and spot-like distributions (13%). FA and ICGA findings were mostly \nunremarkable. Lesion progression primarily occurred within the initial weeks \nfollowing presentation and stabilized in size beyond this period in the majority \nof eyes. Over time, affected areas progressed to outer retinal atrophy with \npigmentary changes. Foveal sparing was observed in 68% of the eyes. None of the \ntherapeutic interventions appeared effective in halting the progression to \ncomplete outer retinal atrophy or preventing lesion enlargement.\nCONCLUSIONS: AOR is characterized by early photoreceptor disruption, evidenced \nby ASHH on OCT, leading to rapid outer retinal atrophy and subsequent \ndegeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium within the damaged zones. \nAlthough distinct patterns of lesion distribution were observed, their \nconsistent features on multimodal imaging support their inclusion within a \nunified disease spectrum termed acute outer retinopathy."}

The search strategy was described by a combination of relevant \nmedical subheadings and keywords. Eligible English language studies were \nreviewed, and their quality was appraised. This review followed the Preferred \nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\nRESULTS: A total of 37 studies, including 1527 participants, met the inclusion \ncriteria. The most frequent etiology was infection, including both bacterial and \nviral infections (n\u00a0=\u00a01124). The most frequent symptoms were cough (reported in \n24 out of 26 studies) and fever (reported in 20 out of 26 studies). The most \nprevalent imaging findings were atelectasis (reported in 18 out of 23 studies), \nconsolidation (reported in 16 out of 23 studies), and pleural effusion (reported \nin 16 out of 23 studies). The combination of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and \nbronchoscopic cast removal was common among all the studies. The symptoms of PB \nwere resolved in most children (82.7\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a0525) after treatment, and the \nsymptoms recurred in 8.0\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a051) of patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review discovered the frequency of various \netiologies, clinical presentations, imaging findings, treatment approaches, and \noutcomes of PB in children.

Understanding the symptoms and dangers \nassociated with ADFBs is crucial in implementing preventative measures to reduce \ntheir occurrences.\nOBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical \ncharacteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of pediatric patients with \nADFBs in the Qassim region.\nDESIGN: Single-center, retrospective study.\nSETTING: Maternal and Children's Hospital, Qassim, Saudi Arabia.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data of pediatric patients (0-14 years) with \nconfirmed ADFBs recorded over the past 5 years at Maternal and Children Hospital \n(MCH) in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia. Data was first cleaned and then analyzed using \nSPSS version 26 to obtain crucial insights.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Common characteristics and management strategies of ADFBs \nin pediatric patients, including demographic factors, such as age and gender, \nthe type and location of the foreign bodies, and the clinical presentation and \noutcomes following intervention.\nSAMPLE SIZE: 149 patients.\nRESULTS: Most patients were symptomatic 89 (59.7%) with frequent symptoms such \nas vomiting 38 (42.7%) followed by drooling 14 (15.7%) and cough 13 (14.6%). \nMost of the objects 122 (81.9%) were radiopaque, impacted in the upper esophagus \nabove clavicle 90 (60.4%). The common foreign body type identified were coin 96 \n(64.4%); seeds 8 (5.4%) and battery 8 (5.4%). Most objects (91.94%) were \nvisualized, and 76.5% were removed via endoscopy. Only 10 (6.7%) of the patients \nhad complications with nearly one-third 3 (30.0%) of them presenting with \nerosion.\nCONCLUSION: Common foreign body types reported are coins, seeds, and batteries. \nMost objects impacted are radiopaque; with endoscopy commonly used in \nvisualization and foreign body extraction from patients. The study highlights \nthe need for increased awareness among caregivers regarding pediatric safety and \nthe potential risks and complications associated with ADFBs. It recommends \nprompt action, including medical intervention and preventive measures, to reduce \nthe incidence and risks of ADFBs.\nLIMITATION: Single-center and retrospective design limited the generalizability \nof the investigation."}

However, many symptoms are non-specific and there is \nconsiderable variation in symptom reporting. It is essential to understand how \nrates of these symptoms compare to the pre-pandemic health of adolescents.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of academic literature and websites, using \ntraditional and automated search systems, was undertaken to identify symptoms \ndescribed in adolescents aged 10-19\u2009years in the 30\u2009years up to and including \n2019. Studies were reviewed and symptom prevalence data extracted.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five sources (n\u2009=\u2009483\u2009097 participants) met the inclusion \ncriteria, including longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs. The \ndescription and prevalence of symptoms varied widely, but there was a high \npre-pandemic median prevalence of cough (13.6%), headache (30.0%), and fatigue \n(20.5%). These high prevalences highlight a gap in understanding of pre-pandemic \nadolescent health and the need for comprehensive, serial symptom profiling.\nCONCLUSION: These findings provide a baseline of adolescent symptomatology prior \nto the emergence of PCC and provide important context for interpreting ongoing \nCOVID symptoms. Data on PCC in adolescents should consider pre-pandemic symptom \nprevalence."}

This \nserious complication endangers the patient's life and safety.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old woman underwent surgical resection of a lung \ntumor under DLTs. Approximately 3 months after surgery, she went to the hospital \nfor treatment due to hoarseness and dyspnea after a change in body position. \nLaryngoscopy revealed that the upper airway was obstructed due to a large cyst \nin the throat, which required surgical resection. Although the crisis was \nresolved by surgical resection, this serious complication of endotracheal \nintubation, which could have endangered the patient's life, was indeed \nworrisome.\nCONCLUSIONS: The DLTs is thick, and the positioning of the intubation technology \nis high, which increases the likelihood of a throat injury. Thus, it is \nnecessary to actively prevent its occurrence during operation. Hoarseness after \noperation needs early examination to detect and treat the injury early and avoid \nsuch serious complications."}

However, \nthe pathophysiological features of YKL-40 remain unclear. The aim of the study \nis to evaluate the associations between YKL-40 and clinical features in patients \nwith asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma-COPD \noverlap (ACO).\nMETHODS: Serum and sputum YKL-40 levels were measured in 46 asthmatics, 35 COPD, \nand 32 ACO patients.\nRESULTS: Serum YKL-40 levels were elevated in the COPD and ACO patients, and \nsputum YKL-40 levels were higher in the COPD patients compared to the \nasthmatics. Both serum and sputum YKL-40 levels positively correlated with \nsputum neutrophils. Only serum YKL-40 levels negatively correlated with FEV1 \n(%predicted), FEV1/FVC, and annual decline in FEV1. In 15 patients whose paired \nserum samples were obtained within 6 months, changes in serum YKL-40 levels \nshowed a significant positive correlation with those in FEV1. Furthermore, \npatients who had experienced exacerbations either in the past year or the \nfollowing year showed significantly greater serum, but not sputum, YKL-40 \nlevels. Sputum YKL-40 levels showed significant correlations with scores on the \nCOPD assessment test and modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum and sputum YKL-40 may reflect distinct clinical features in \nobstructive airway disorders. Serum YKL-40 may provide beneficial information on \npredicting obstructive neutrophilic inflammation and exacerbations, whilst \nsputum YKL-40 may offer valuable insights for evaluating ongoing symptoms. \nConcomitant measurement of YKL-40 in serum and sputum might be more useful than \nindividual measurement."}

Optimizing respiratory \nmuscle performance through novel interventions may enhance patient outcomes. Our \nobjective is to compare the efficacy of the PowerBreathe device and \ntranscutaneous electrical diaphragmatic stimulation (TEDS) on COPD severity and \nfunctional capacity.\nMETHODS: Sixty male patients (45-65\u00a0years; BMI 25-29.9\u00a0kg/m2) with stage II or \nIII COPD under full medical management were allocated at random to Group A who \nreceived inspiratory muscle (IM) training (IMT) using the PowerBreathe device in \naddition to prescribed medications and Group B who received TEDS alongside \nstandard therapy. Outcomes assessed included the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) \nscore, dyspnea score, six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced expiratory volume in \none second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced \nmid-expiratory flow (FEF 25%-75%).\nRESULTS: Group A showed significantly reduced CAT scores and dyspnea severity \npost-treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "shortness of breath", "text": "PURPOSE: To explore the dynamic changes and to identify core symptoms using \nnetwork analysis in lung cancer survivors before, during, and after radiotherapy \nusing a longitudinal approach.\nMETHODS: This study recruited 234 lung cancer survivors from a prospective and \nlongitudinal study in a tertiary cancer hospital of China from January 2023 to \nOctober 2024. M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory of lung cancer module (MDASI-LC) \nand Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to measured physical \nand psychological symptoms at the time of pre-radiotherapy, the end of \nradiotherapy, and 4\u00a0weeks after radiotherapy, respectively. Network analysis was \nperformed using R software version 4.3.2 to identify the core symptoms.\nRESULTS: A total of 234 lung cancer survivors are treated with radiotherapy; \nparticipants were included with an average age of 59.2\u00a0years, predominantly male \n(78.2%), representing various lung cancer subtypes and stages. Before \nradiotherapy, poor appetite was identified as the core symptom. At the end of \nradiotherapy, shortness of breath emerged as the central symptom, likely driven \nby radiation-induced respiratory complications. Four weeks after radiotherapy, \nfatigue became the most significant symptom. Psychological networks revealed \ndepressive symptoms of lack of optimism as core before radiotherapy, panic as \ncentral at the end of treatment, and tension as predominant post-radiotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the dynamic evolution of core symptoms in \nlung cancer survivors undergoing radiotherapy. Findings underscore the \nimportance of early interventions targeting appetite and psychological distress, \nas well as post-treatment strategies to address fatigue and emotional tension. \nIntegrating physical and psychological care through symptom network analysis can \nguide personalized management approaches, improving patient quality of life and \ntreatment outcomes.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Integrating dynamic symptom management \nstrategies that address evolving physical and psychological challenges, such as \nappetite, fatigue, and emotional tension, can significantly enhance quality of \nlife and treatment outcomes for lung cancer survivors undergoing radiotherapy."}

Despite recommendations for opioid use \nto manage AVOC pain, regional variations and biases in pain management persist, \nparticularly in Saudi Arabia, where the prevalence of SCD varies by region.\nOBJECTIVE: To identify national trends in pain management for AVOC in EDs across \nSaudi Arabia and analyze the duration and frequency of ED visits.\nDESIGN: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.\nSETTINGS: Multiple acute care centers in Saudi Arabia under the Ministry of \nNational Guard Health Affairs, including EDs and urgent care centers in Riyadh, \nJeddah, Al-Ahsa, Dhahran, and Medina.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 421 SCD patients presenting with AVOC between \n2016 and 2021 were included. Patients with other complications such as \ninfections or acute chest syndrome were excluded. Data on patient demographics, \nED visit frequency, length of stay, and medications administered were collected.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the duration and frequency of \nED visits and the types and frequency of analgesics administered.\nSAMPLE SIZE: The study included 421 patients accounting for 20 508 ED visits.\nRESULTS: The average length of stay per ED visit was 4.7 hours. Morphine was the \nmost frequently used opioid, administered to 86% of patients, while paracetamol \nwas the most commonly used analgesic overall (93%). Regional differences were \nobserved, with less opioid use in the Eastern region, where the disease is less \nsevere due to haplotype variations. Ketamine was used in 13% of cases, \npredominantly in the Western region.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study highlights a diverse approach to AVOC management across \nSaudi Arabia, with variations influenced by regional differences and physician \npractices. Paracetamol and morphine were the primary analgesics, though \ndisparities in opioid use suggest the need for standardized pain management \nprotocols.\nLIMITATIONS: This study was limited to centers under one organization and \nexcluded patients with coexisting conditions, which may limit generalizability."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "chest pain", "text": "Ultrasound-guided transverse thoracic plane (TTP) block has been shown to be \nhighly effective in relieving postoperative pain in a variety of surgeries \ninvolving the anterior chest wall. Accurate identification of the target \nstructure on ultrasound images is key to the successful implementation of TTP \nblock. Nevertheless, the complexity of anatomical structures in the targeted \nblockade area coupled with the potential for adverse clinical incidents presents \nconsiderable challenges, particularly for anesthesiologists who are less \nexperienced. This study applied deep learning methods to TTP block and developed \na deep learning model to achieve real-time region segmentation in ultrasound to \nassist doctors in the accurate identification of the target nerve. Using 2329 \nimages from 155 patients, we successfully segmented key structures associated \nwith TTP areas and nerve blocks, including the transversus thoracis muscle, \nlungs, and bones. The achieved IoU (Intersection over Union) scores are 0.7272, \n0.9736, and 0.8244 in that order. Recall metrics were 0.8305, 0.9896, and 0.9336 \nrespectively, whilst Dice coefficients reached 0.8421, 0.9866, and 0.9037, \nparticularly with an accuracy surpassing 97% in the identification of perilous \nlung regions.

Urgent surgical repair is indicated when LA \ndissection results in hemodynamic instability, typically through obstruction of \nthe left atrial outflow, obstruction of the left atrial inflow, or cardiac \ntamponade. Although complete heart block is not a previously reported downstream \ncomplication of LA dissection, aspects of the atrioventricular (AV) node, \nparticularly the compact AV node, lie within the interatrial septum and could be \ndamaged by dissection.\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGES: LA dissection is a rare, but potentially serious, \ncomplication that most commonly arises following mitral valve surgery. Although \nthe presence of hemodynamic instability renders LA dissection a surgical \nemergency, a conservative approach that avoids reintervention may otherwise be \nconsidered."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "chest pain", "text": "OBJECTIVES: Most patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency medical \nservices (EMS) setting are suspected of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(NSTE-ACS). Distinguishing true NSTE-ACS from non-cardiac chest pain based \nsolely on the ECG is challenging. The aim of this study is to develop and \nvalidate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for risk \nstratification of suspected NSTE-ACS patients and to compare its performance \nwith currently available prehospital diagnostic tools.\nMETHODS: For this study, an internal training cohort and an external validation \ncohort were used, both consisting of suspected NSTE-ACS patients. A CNN (ECG \ninterpretation by CNN (ECG-AI)) was trained and validated to detect NSTE-ACS. \nThe diagnostic value of ECG-AI in detecting NSTE-ACS was compared with on-site \nECG analyses by an EMS paramedic (ECG-EMS), point-of-care troponin assessment \nand a validated prehospital clinical risk score (prehospital History, ECG, Age, \nRisk factors and POC-troponin (preHEART)).\nRESULTS: A total of 5645 patients suspected of NSTE-ACS were included. In the \nexternal validation cohort (n=754), 27% were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS. ECG-AI had \na better diagnostic performance than ECG-EMS (area under the curve (AUROC) 0.70 \n(0.66 to 0.74) vs AUROC 0.65 (0.61 to 0.70), p=0.045) for diagnosing NSTE-ACS. \nThe overall diagnostic accuracy of preHEART was AUROC 0.78 (0.74 to 0.82) and \nsuperior compared with ECG-AI (p=0.001). Incorporating ECG-AI into preHEART led \nto a significant improvement in diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.83 (0.79 to \n0.86), p<0.001).\nDISCUSSION: Correctly identifying patients who are at low risk for having \nNSTE-ACS is crucial for optimal triage in the prehospital setting. Recent \nstudies have shown that these low-risk patients could potentially be left at \nhome or transferred to a general practitioner, leading to less emergency \ndepartment overcrowding and lower healthcare costs. Other studies demonstrated \nbetter overall diagnostic performance compared with our artificial intelligence \n(AI) model. However, these studies were aimed at a study population with a high \nprevalence of occlusive myocardial infarction, which could explain the differing \nlevels of diagnostic performance.\nCONCLUSION: Integrating AI in prehospital ECG interpretation improves the \nidentification of patients at low risk for having NSTE-ACS. Nonetheless, \nclinical risk scores currently yield the best diagnostic performance and their \naccuracy could be further enhanced through AI. Our results pave the way for new \nstudies focused on exploring the role of AI in prehospital risk-stratification \nefforts."}

Nonetheless, \ncomparisons between these two techniques remain controversial.\nMETHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, \nCochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. Randomized \ncontrolled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies directly comparing the knotless and \nknotted arthroscopic Bankart procedures were included. The primary outcomes were \nrates of recurrent instability and revision surgeries. Secondary outcomes \nencompassed number of anchors, operative time, improvements in functional scores \nincluding Rowe score and Constant-Murley score (CMS), pain level assessed by the \nvisual analogue scale (VAS) score, range of motion (ROM), adverse events, and \nradiological results. Quality assessment was performed using RoB2 and MINORS \ntools. Meta-analysis pooled RCT data using Review Manager 5.4.1, and non-pooled \noutcomes from cohort studies or limited RCT data were reported separately.\nRESULTS: This meta-analysis included nine studies with a total of 729 patients. \nPooled data from three RCTs demonstrated no significant differences between the \ntwo techniques in terms of re-dislocation (P\u2009=\u20090.78), recurrent anterior \nsubluxation and positive apprehension test (P\u2009=\u20090.78), revision surgery \n(P\u2009=\u20090.94), number of anchors used (P\u2009=\u20090.26), or improvements in Rowe score \n(P\u2009=\u20090.15). For outcomes not suitable for pooling, qualitative analysis of \ntrends indicated comparable outcomes between the groups, except a slightly \nreduced operative time in the knotless repair group. Adverse events were \ninfrequently reported and occurred at similar rates in both groups. Limited \nradiological data from one RCT showed no significant differences in MRI \nparameters at the 24-month follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Both techniques demonstrate comparable clinical outcomes. The only \npotential advantage of the knotless technique is a possible reduction in \noperative time, though its clinical significance remains uncertain. Given the \nlimitations of the evidence, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION ID: CRD42024586135."}

Although many scholars have studied the effects of playing posture on \nlumbar-pelvic kinematics, few have focused on marching band performance.\nPURPOSE: This study assessed the influence of basic posture during marching band \nperformance on lumbar-pelvic kinematics.\nMETHODS: The participants were healthy young adults without musculoskeletal \ninjuries. Gait was measured under three conditions using a three-dimensional \nmovement analysis system: normal gait, gait with a 1.15\u00a0kg trumpet, and marching \nband performance. An analysis of a single right gait cycle was used in this \nstudy to compare the spatiotemporal parameters and joint angles between \nconditions.\nRESULTS: The mean values of the thoracic posterior tilt angle, thoracolumbar \ntransition, lumbar extension angle, and anterior pelvic tilt angle in forward \nmarching were significantly higher than those in free walking and \ninstrument-grasping gait (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The change in the thoracic and lumbar \nrotation angles in forward marching was significantly lower than those in free \nwalking (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nDISCUSSION: Forward marching may increase lumbar extension, heighten shear \nforces, and activate the erector spinae muscles. Restricted upper limb swing may \nhinder the coordination of the erector spinae muscles and impair trunk \nstability.\nCONCLUSION: Increased trunk/pelvic extension and decreased trunk rotation during \nforward marching may lead to overloading of the erector spinae muscle. Attention \nto posture during marching may help prevent low back pain."}

However, recent recommendations \nsuggest that stretching until reaching a new maximal angle may offer greater \nbenefits owing to increased stretching intensity. This study aimed to examine \nthe acute effects of resetting the static stretching intensity on flexibility.\nMETHODS: In this randomized crossover trial, 14 healthy participants performed \n300-s of static stretching of the right hamstrings randomly under two \nconditions: resetting the stretching intensity at new maximal knee extension \nangles every 30\u00a0s (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030-s) or no-resetting (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300-s). The outcomes assessed \nincluded range of motion (ROM), passive torque (PT) at pain onset, passive \nstiffness before and after stretching, and stretching angle during stretching.\nRESULTS: During the 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030-s condition, stretching angle was increased \ngradually (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Significant improvements were observed in ROM, PT at pain \nonset, and passive stiffness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after stretching under both conditions. \nMoreover, the relative improvement in these parameters was greater under the \n10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030-s condition than under the 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300-s condition (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest that resetting stretching intensity can \nenhance flexibility, possibly due to the increased stretching intensity, \nunderscoring the importance of individualized stretching approaches to optimize \nflexibility outcomes."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "joint pain", "text": "Shoulder problems are among the most common musculoskeletal complaints, with \nhigh lifetime incidence and re-occurrence rates. Research is struggling to \nunravel the relationship between symptomology, local structural changes and \nexperienced pain. This paper explains some such links, exploring the connections \nbetween the respiratory system, forward head posture, and nerve compression. The \neffects of peripheral nerve irritations on pain, reflexive changes, faulty nerve \ndischarges, referred pain, and alteration of muscle recruitment patterns are \ndiscussed and suggested to be evidence of a hierarchy existing between the \nneural and musculoskeletal structures. The content presented is based on \nclinical experience and a narrative literature review, and it is combined into \nan evidence-based clinical reasoning model. Challenges in detecting intermittent \nnerve compressions via different diagnostic tools are also addressed. It is \nsuggested that dynamic and transient nerve compressions during functional \nmovements are often overlooked, as there seems to be no diagnostic tool which \ncan confirm (rule in) nerve involvement when symptoms suggesting nerve \ninvolvement are present. Finally, a four-step treatment model for addressing \nfunctional relationships between respiration, forward head posture, nerve \ncompressions and motor control impairments is presented. In conclusion, this \nreview argues that prioritising afferent-efferent neuromuscular \ninterconnectedness in treating complex shoulder dysfunction could lead to \nimproved clinical outcomes and lower re-occurrence rates. Experienced clinicians \nshould form clinical reasoning models giving equal value to all three pillars of \nEvidence-Based Practice (EBP) - combining their experience and patient feedback \nwith the literature. This would lead to patient-centred integration of research \nand clinical practice, which could help reduce the gap between the academic and \nclinical worlds."}

It improved the maximum repetition capacity for the left \nknee extension (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) movement and for the right and left knee \nflexion(p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, it was able to reduce the MIVC right and left knee \nflexion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nCONCLUSION: Telerehabilitation was able to increase the recruitment of the right \nbiceps femoris muscles and maintain the recruitment of the right and left rectus \nfemoris; improve the maximum repetition capacity for left knee extension and of \nboth the right and left knees flexion movement. However, it could not increase \nthe MVIC after the training period."}

Retention, responder (\u2265\u200950% \nseizure reduction) rates, seizure-free rates and adverse events (AEs) were \nanalyzed. Sub-analyses examined early (\u2264\u20091 previous ASM) vs. late (>\u20092 previous \nASMs) add-on groups.\nRESULTS: The sample included 485 patients with focal and generalized epilepsy: \n354 with\u2009<\u20095 seizures/month, 79 with 5-20, and 52 with\u2009>\u200920 seizures/month. \nRetention rates at 12\u00a0months were 75.1%, 68%, and 58.1.7%, respectively. \nPerampanel significantly reduced seizure frequency in all groups, with responder \nrates of 71.2%, 61.8%, and 63.2% at the 12-month follow-up.

The Patient Perspective of Arrhythmia Questionnaire (PPAQ) was \ninitially developed as a self-administered, disease-specific PROM for patients \nwith supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) assessing the impact of the arrhythmia \nand symptoms on patients' daily activities and physical, emotional, and social \nfunctioning. Preliminary evidence of content and construct validity has been \npreviously demonstrated, but only in SVT patients in the U.S. and Poland. The \naim of this study was to further evaluate the concurrent validity of the PPAQ in \npatients having a variety of arrhythmias and to explore whether differences in \nsymptoms existed by gender.\nMETHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional study, adult cardiac arrhythmia outpatients \nfrom a tertiary care, academic medical center completed the 6-item PPAQ, the \nSF-12, a Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), \nand the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Included were patients with atrial \nfibrillation (82.4%), ventricular tachycardia (15.7%), and atrial tachycardia \n(2%). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, pairwise comparisons with \nPearson correlations, Goodman Kruskal gamma statistic for ordinal associations, \nCronbach's alpha, and Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) were used to determine \nconcurrent construct validity and internal consistency reliability.\nRESULTS: Participants (n=51) had a mean age of 59.4 years (\u00b1 12.6), were \nmajority male (66.7%) and Caucasian (75%). Preliminary evidence of concurrent \nconstruct validity was found based on moderate to strong correlations (range \nfrom 0.4 to 0.7) between the PPAQ and other validated measures, as well as \nstrong internal reliability (KR-20 of 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.91). The \nmost common symptoms reported were fatigue (60.8%) and heart fluttering (52.9%). \nBlurred vision (p<0.04), dizziness (p<0.01), and fatigue (p<0.04) were seen \nsignificantly more frequently in men compared to women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results present additional evidence of the validity and reliability \nof the PPAQ. The PPAQ comprehensively measures the burden of the disease from \ncardiac arrhythmia patients' perspective.

Although the \netiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is \nanatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to \nthese symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and \nneurotransmitter regulation.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent pineal cyst \nresection at our center between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients \npresenting with hydrocephalus or concomitant conditions were excluded.\nRESULTS: Seven female patients (median age 27, range 19-42) were analyzed. The \nmost common preoperative symptom was headaches, present in all patients, \nfollowed by fatigue, dizziness, memory problems, and psychiatric symptoms. \nPostoperatively, 85.7% (6/7) had complete headache resolution, while one (14.3%) \nhad partial relief. Cognitive symptoms, including memory and concentration \nproblems, improved in 66.6% (2/3) of cases, and psychiatric symptoms improved in \n66% (4/6). The median follow-up was 24 months, with no new neurological deficits \nat the final follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection can lead to significant improvements in \nnon-specific symptoms including headaches, psychiatric disturbances, and \ncognitive issues in a subset of pineal cyst patients with severe refractory \nsymptoms.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "dizziness", "text": "BACKGROUND: Conventional nystagmus classification methods often rely on \nsubjective observation by specialists, which is time-consuming and variable \namong clinicians. Recently, deep learning techniques have been used to automate \nnystagmus classification using convolutional and recurrent neural networks. \nThese networks can accurately classify nystagmus patterns using video data. \nHowever, associated challenges including the need for large datasets when \ncreating models, limited applicability to address specific image conditions, and \nthe complexity associated with using these models.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a novel approach for nystagmus \nclassification that used the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 Vision \n(GPT-4V) model, which is a state-of-the-art large-scale language model with \npowerful image recognition capabilities.\nMETHODS: We developed a pupil-tracking process using a nystagmus-recording video \nand verified the optimization model's accuracy using GPT-4V classification and \nnystagmus recording. We tested whether the created optimization model could be \nevaluated in six categories of nystagmus: right horizontal, left horizontal, \nupward, downward, right torsional, and left torsional. The traced trajectory was \ninput as two-dimensional coordinate data or an image, and multiple in-context \nlearning methods were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The developed model showed an overall classification accuracy of 37% \nwhen using pupil-traced images and a maximum accuracy of 24.6% when pupil \ncoordinates were used as input. Regarding orientation, we achieved a maximum \naccuracy of 69% for the classification of horizontal nystagmus patterns but a \nlower accuracy for the vertical and torsional components.\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the potential of versatile vertigo management in a \ngenerative artificial intelligence model that improves the accuracy and \nefficiency of nystagmus classification. We also highlighted areas for further \nimprovement, such as expanding the dataset size and enhancing input modalities, \nto improve classification performance across all nystagmus types. The GPT-4V \nmodel validated only for recognizing still images can be linked to video \nclassification and proposed as a novel method."}

Patients with SIH often \nexperience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory \nchanges, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral \nanalgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require \nadvanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim \nof this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with \nrefractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks.\nMETHODS: This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved \n(STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of \nspontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from \nSeptember 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and \noutcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative \nBern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist.\nRESULTS: Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative \nmanagement underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of \n52.1 \u00b1 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches \n(92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications \nwere Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved \nsignificant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in \nheadache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale \nscores (P < .01).\nCONCLUSION: Surgical repair is crucial for managing refractory SIH, with \ntailored techniques based on leak type and location.

We investigated LDOM adverse \neffects (AEs) in AGA patients.\nMETHODS: AGA patients taking LDOM were identified (January 1, 2010-December 3, \n2022). AEs and management were recorded from follow-up and emergency room \nvisits. Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, and Benjamini-Hochberg \nprocedure assessed significance and adjusted for multiple comparisons.\nRESULTS: Three hundred ten AGA patients were analyzed with mean age 47.5 years \nand 53.2% females. The average LDOM dose was lower for females vs. males. AEs \nwere observed in 14.9% of patients, with dizziness/lightheadedness, \nhypertrichosis, and extremity edema being most common. Higher doses were \nassociated with increased likelihood of dizziness/lightheadedness. Females had \nhigher overall incidence of AEs; however, gender differences did not persist \nafter subgroup analysis. Among patients experiencing AEs, 11.1% adjusted their \ndosage and 28.9% discontinued treatment.\nCONCLUSION: A higher LDOM dose increased risk of dizziness/lightheadedness in \nboth genders, with females more likely to experience any AE. Patients are often \nstarted at inappropriately high doses, causing AE-induced regimen changes. \nTherefore, we recommend a cautious approach when prescribing LDOM, starting with \nlower doses and gradually increasing as tolerated, and counseling female \npatients regarding their higher risk of AEs."}

Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia \nhave been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are \nincluded in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, \nsince total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive \norgans and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, \ndo these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint \narthroplasty surgery?\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative \ncarbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data \nwas collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 \npatients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed \nother short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating \nscale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse \nevents (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included \nindependent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical \ndata. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the \npotential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups.\nRESULTS: Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared \nwith the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we \nfound that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a \nsignificant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI \u2265 30. Among secondary \noutcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved \npostoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital \nstay.\nCONCLUSION: Although the combination of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and \nmultimodal analgesia did not show broad effectiveness in reducing PONV after \nTKA, it offered significant benefits for obese patients by reducing insulin \nresistance and decreasing PONV. Additionally, it demonstrated notable \neffectiveness in pain control, which significantly shortened the length of \nhospital stay."}

Central \nsensitization (CS) was diagnosed using the Central Sensitization Inventory \n(CSI), with a cutoff score of \u2265\u200940. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied \nto balance baseline characteristics between the CS and non-CS groups. \nPreoperative factors, postoperative outcomes (pain levels, complications, opioid \nconsumption, hospital stay), and the incidence of chronic pain and \ndissatisfaction at six months were collected and analyzed using SPSS software.\nRESULTS: A total of 230 patients were included, with 36 (15.7%) classified as \nhaving CS. Multivariable logistic regression identified female gender (OR: 3.9, \n95% CI: 1.0-14.3, P\u2009=\u20090.043), higher body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: \n1.1-1.3, P\u2009=\u20090.006), and residence above 4,000\u00a0m (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.7-15.1, \nP\u2009=\u20090.003) as significant factors associated with CS. After PSM, the CS group \nhad significantly worse short-term outcomes, with higher pain scores at 24, 48, \nand 72\u00a0h (P\u2009<\u20090.001), increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting \n(PONV) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), longer hospital stays (P\u2009<\u20090.001), greater cumulative opioid \nconsumption (P\u2009<\u20090.001), higher rates of chronic postoperative pain (46.9% vs. \n21.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.014), and greater patient dissatisfaction (25.0% vs. 6.3%, \nP\u2009=\u20090.039) compared to the non-CS group.\nCONCLUSION: This study found a 15.7% prevalence of CS among high-altitude TKA \npatients.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "nausea", "text": "Up to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to first-line treatment and \namong those who do respond, only about half achieve remission. For this reason, \nguidelines for treating depression mainly focus on how to proceed in cases of \ntreatment failure or only partial response. The aim of this review paper is to \npresent studies evaluating the effectiveness of vortioxetine in treatment of \npatients with depression following treatment failure with an SSRI/SNRI drug. \nVortioxetine is an effective antidepressant that, after treatment failure with \nan SSRI/SNRI drug, allows 32-55% of patients to achieve remission. However, the \nassessed dosing regimen of vortioxetine deviated from that used in the initial \ntherapy of depression, i.e. by the second week (8th day) of therapy the dose was \nincreased to the maximum - 20 mg/day and the period for treatment effectiveness \nassessment was 8-12 weeks. This dosing regimen more closely resembles the \npharmacological approach utilised in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive \ndisorder rather than depression. The administration of a high dose of \nvortioxetine did not negatively impact the tolerability of the treatment, even \namong patient groups at high risk of adverse events (elderly patients, \nco-existence of anxiety). The most common adverse effect was nausea; however, it \nwas not observed that rapid dose escalation intensified this effect. This is \nmost likely attributable to the receptor profile of vortioxetine."}

Maribavir (MBV), a new AV treatment approved for \nrefractory/resistant post-transplant CMV infections, demonstrated superior viral \nclearance in SOLSTICE trial.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective lab-linked claims analysis of solid \norgan transplant (SOT) patients on VGCV (\u2265900\u2009mg BID) treatment who newly \nswitched to MBV (i.e. index date) between 12/01/21-12/31/23. MBV treatment \neffectiveness (CMV viremia clearance/no treatment switch) and tolerability (e.g. \nleukopenia) during 3-months pre- and post-index were examined.\nRESULTS: Of 1,247 post-SOT VGCV-treated patients, 81 switched to MBV; mean age \nwas 55\u2009years and 73% had kidney transplant. Among 33 with follow-up labs, 88% \n(n\u2009=\u200929) achieved viral clearance. Of the remaining 48 without follow-up labs, \n60.4% (n\u2009=\u200929) did not switch to other AV treatments. The combined treatment \neffectiveness was 71.6%. Tolerability issues decreased after MBV initiation: \nwith leukopenia, neutropenia, nausea, and diarrhea decreasing by 14.3%, 3.57%, \n14.3%, and 17.86%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: MBV-treated patients had 10-15% lower tolerability issues; over 7 in \n10 demonstrated treatment effectiveness in this real-world analysis. MBV's \nfavorable benefit-risk profile makes it a potentially valuable addition to the \nCMV treatment armamentarium.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCT02931539."}

Patients with SIH often \nexperience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory \nchanges, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral \nanalgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require \nadvanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim \nof this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with \nrefractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks.\nMETHODS: This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved \n(STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of \nspontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from \nSeptember 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and \noutcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative \nBern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist.\nRESULTS: Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative \nmanagement underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of \n52.1 \u00b1 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches \n(92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications \nwere Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved \nsignificant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in \nheadache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale \nscores (P < .01).\nCONCLUSION: Surgical repair is crucial for managing refractory SIH, with \ntailored techniques based on leak type and location.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "vomiting", "text": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are major concerns \nfor surgical patients. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia \nhave been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are \nincluded in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, \nsince total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive \norgans and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, \ndo these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint \narthroplasty surgery?\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative \ncarbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data \nwas collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 \npatients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed \nother short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating \nscale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse \nevents (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included \nindependent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical \ndata. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the \npotential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups.\nRESULTS: Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared \nwith the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we \nfound that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a \nsignificant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI \u2265 30. Among secondary \noutcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved \npostoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital \nstay.\nCONCLUSION: Although the combination of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and \nmultimodal analgesia did not show broad effectiveness in reducing PONV after \nTKA, it offered significant benefits for obese patients by reducing insulin \nresistance and decreasing PONV. Additionally, it demonstrated notable \neffectiveness in pain control, which significantly shortened the length of \nhospital stay."}

Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied \nto balance baseline characteristics between the CS and non-CS groups. \nPreoperative factors, postoperative outcomes (pain levels, complications, opioid \nconsumption, hospital stay), and the incidence of chronic pain and \ndissatisfaction at six months were collected and analyzed using SPSS software.\nRESULTS: A total of 230 patients were included, with 36 (15.7%) classified as \nhaving CS. Multivariable logistic regression identified female gender (OR: 3.9, \n95% CI: 1.0-14.3, P\u2009=\u20090.043), higher body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: \n1.1-1.3, P\u2009=\u20090.006), and residence above 4,000\u00a0m (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.7-15.1, \nP\u2009=\u20090.003) as significant factors associated with CS. After PSM, the CS group \nhad significantly worse short-term outcomes, with higher pain scores at 24, 48, \nand 72\u00a0h (P\u2009<\u20090.001), increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting \n(PONV) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), longer hospital stays (P\u2009<\u20090.001), greater cumulative opioid \nconsumption (P\u2009<\u20090.001), higher rates of chronic postoperative pain (46.9% vs. \n21.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.014), and greater patient dissatisfaction (25.0% vs. 6.3%, \nP\u2009=\u20090.039) compared to the non-CS group.\nCONCLUSION: This study found a 15.7% prevalence of CS among high-altitude TKA \npatients. Female gender, higher BMI, and residence at altitudes above 4,000\u00a0m \nwere identified as factors associated with CS. Furthermore, CS was linked to \nworse short-term postoperative outcomes, including higher pain levels, increased \nincidence of PONV, greater opioid consumption, longer hospital stays, and a \nhigher prevalence of chronic postoperative pain and dissatisfaction."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "vomiting", "text": "BACKGROUND: Chlorine-based disinfectants, such as bleach, are widely used in \nhealthcare settings. However, their use has been linked to occupational \nrespiratory risks. During disinfection, both chlorine gas and ultrafine \nparticles (UFPs) can be generated, yet their exposure dynamics and health \nimpacts remain poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the emissions \nof chlorine gas and UFPs during disinfection under varying environmental and \nsurface conditions to better understand exposure dynamics and inform risk \nmitigation strategies.\nMETHODS: Controlled experiments were conducted in a sealed chamber to simulate \ntypical healthcare disinfection scenarios. Bleach was tested under different \nconditions of temperature, light exposure, and in the presence of organic \ncontaminants, including simulated vomit, urine, and blood. Chlorine gas was \nquantified using electrochemical sensors, while UFP emissions were measured \nusing a condensation particle counter and mobility particle sizers. Additional \nvalidation experiments were performed in real-world office settings before and \nafter cleaning.\nRESULTS: Chlorine gas was primarily emitted when bleach interacted with organic \ncontaminants, particularly acidic substances such as simulated vomit, with an \nemission factor of 9.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 \u00b5g/min/m2. In contrast, UFP emissions were highest \non clean surfaces under elevated temperature and light exposure, reaching up to \n1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091011 particles/min/m2. Real-world validation confirmed that cleaning prior \nto disinfection significantly reduced chlorine gas emissions but led to \nincreased UFP formation. Chlorine gas and UFP emissions were rarely observed \nsimultaneously, indicating distinct and independent emission pathways.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bleach-based disinfection generates airborne hazards through \nseparate mechanisms: chlorine gas via reactions with organic residues and UFPs \nthrough secondary processes influenced by environmental conditions. These \nfindings support enhanced cleaning protocols, improved ventilation, and the need \nfor regulatory attention to UFP exposure in occupational settings."}

We report results after 18 months of \nadditional follow-up.\nMETHODS: In this ongoing open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients with \nBRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC (59 treatment-na\u00efve and 39 previously treated) received \nencorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily. Primary \nendpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included \nduration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival \n(OS), and safety.\nRESULTS: At this data cutoff, median treatment duration with encorafenib plus \nbinimetinib was 16.3 months in treatment-na\u00efve and 5.5 months in previously \ntreated patients; minimum follow-up was approximately 32 and 22 months, \nrespectively. In treatment-na\u00efve patients, the ORR was 75%, median DOR was 40.0 \nmonths, median PFS was 30.2 months, median OS was not estimable (NE; 95% CI: \n31.3-NE), and the 3-year OS rate was 53%. In previously treated patients, the \nORR was 46%, median DOR was 16.7 months, median PFS was 9.3 months, median OS \nwas 22.7 months, and the 3-year OS rate was 29%. Overall, the most frequent \ntreatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (52%), diarrhea (44%), \nfatigue (33%), and vomiting (30%). TRAEs led to dose reductions and permanent \ntreatment discontinuations in 25 (26%) and 16 (16%) patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: With longer follow-up, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed durable \nand clinically meaningful antitumor activity, especially in treatment-na\u00efve \npatients, with a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant \nmNSCLC."}

Patients with SIH often \nexperience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory \nchanges, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral \nanalgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require \nadvanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim \nof this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with \nrefractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks.\nMETHODS: This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved \n(STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of \nspontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from \nSeptember 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and \noutcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative \nBern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist.\nRESULTS: Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative \nmanagement underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of \n52.1 \u00b1 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches \n(92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications \nwere Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved \nsignificant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in \nheadache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale \nscores (P < .01).\nCONCLUSION: Surgical repair is crucial for managing refractory SIH, with \ntailored techniques based on leak type and location.

Calf diarrhea, being \nthe main contributor to calf morbidity and mortality, is a major issue within \nthe livestock sector in Ethiopia. However, studies on viruses and the virome in \ncalves is lacking in the country. Therefore, we utilized viral metagenomics to \ninvestigate the diversity of RNA viruses in healthy and diarrheic calves from \ncentral Ethiopia.\nMETHODS: Fecal material from 47 calves were collected, pooled, and sequenced \nusing Illumina. Following sequencing, the virome composition and individual \nviral sequences were investigated using bioinformatic analysis.\nRESULTS: The metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of several RNA viruses, \nincluding rotavirus and bovine coronavirus, known causative agents in calf \ndiarrhea. In addition, several enteric RNA viruses that have not been detected \nin cattle in Ethiopia previously, such as norovirus, nebovirus, astrovirus, \ntorovirus, kobuvirus, enterovirus, boosepivirus and hunnivirus were identified. \nFurthermore, a highly divergent viral sequence, which we gave the working name \nsuluvirus, was found. Suluvirus showed a similar genome structure to viruses \nwithin the Picornaviridae family and phylogenetic analysis showed that it \nclusters with crohiviruses. However, due to its very divergent amino acid \nsequence, we propose that suluvirus represent either a new genus within the \nPicornaviridae or a new species within crohiviruses.\nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the RNA \nvirome in Ethiopian cattle and the study revealed multiple RNA viruses \ncirculating in both diarrheic and healthy calves, as well as a putative novel \nvirus, suluvirus. Our study highlights that viral metagenomics is a powerful \ntool in understanding the divergence of viruses and their possible association \nto calf diarrhea, enabling characterization of known viruses as well as \ndiscovery of novel viruses."}

Nintedanib, an antifibrotic agent, has been shown \nin clinical trials to slow the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) and reduce \nacute exacerbations (AE-IPF). Long-term studies confirm its continued \neffectiveness, though side effects like diarrhea may affect adherence. Despite \nreal-world data supporting nintedanib's benefits, no prospective study has \nassessed its efficacy in early-stage IPF. This study evaluated the efficacy, \nsafety, and tolerability of nintedanib in patients with early-stage IPF to \nassess its effectiveness outside randomized control trials.\nMETHODS: A 1-year interim analysis of a prospective, multicenter observational \nstudy was conducted in Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan. This study included 215 \npatients with early-stage IPF (stage I/II per the Japanese IPF severity system) \nwho were followed up for 52 weeks. Changes in FVC and diffusion capacity of \ncarbon monoxide (DLco); incidence of adverse events, acute exacerbations, and \ndeath; and factors associated with FVC decline and nintedanib discontinuation \nwere evaluated.\nRESULTS: The percentage of predicted FVC (%FVC) remained stable, from 83.2% at \nbaseline to 83.7% at 52 weeks, while %DLco decreased from 70.8% to 64.2%. \nIncidences of acute exacerbation and death were both 4.7%. Nintedanib was \ndiscontinued due to adverse events in 21.9% of the patients. Risk factors for \nFVC decline (>5%) included female sex, GAP stage II/III, low oxygen saturation \n(SpO2) in the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), and elevated biomarkers (KL-6). \nSignificant factors for nintedanib discontinuation were advanced age, modified \nMedical Research Council (mMRC) grade I or higher, GAP stage II/III, low %FVC, \nlow SpO2 in the 6 MWT, short 6 MWT distance, and low albumin levels.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this interim analysis indicate that nintedanib has \ngood efficacy, safety, and tolerability for early-stage IPF in real-world \nsettings, outside randomized control trials."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "diarrhea", "text": "BACKGROUND: Porcine group A rotavirus (RVA) is a significant causative agent of \ndiarrhea in piglets, leading to substantial economic losses in pig farms \nworldwide. While horizontal transmission of RVA among pig populations is well \ndocumented, the possibility of vertical transmission from sows to newborn \npiglets has not been definitively confirmed.\nRESULTS: In this study, piglet testicles, umbilical cord blood, and colostrum \nwere collected from porcine RVA (PoRVA)-active farms for analysis. The samples \npresented high PoRVA-positive rates, with 70.00% in the testicle samples, 55.00% \nin the umbilical cord blood samples, and 73.33% in the colostrum samples. \nImmunohistochemical assays confirmed the presence of PoRVA in neonatal piglet \ntesticles. Additionally, two PoRVA strains, RVA/Pig/CHN/QT/2023/G9P [23] \n(QT2023) and RVA/Pig/CHN/BH/2023/G12P [7] (BH2023), were isolated from newborn \npiglet testicles. Complete genome analyses revealed that strains QT2023 and \nBH2023 both presented a Wa-like backbone, with the genotype constellation of \nG9-P [23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G12-P [7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, \nrespectively. While strains QT2023 and BH2023 originated from PoRVAs, sequence \nidentities and phylogenetic analyses suggested close relationships with human \nrotaviruses in specific genes. Furthermore, successful viral replication of \nthese strains in MA-104 cells was observed. Inoculation of PoRVA-negative \npiglets with strains QT2023 and BH2023 resulted in clinical diarrhea, fecal \nvirus shedding, and intestinal pathological changes, highlighting the \npathogenicity of these strains.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that PoRVA can breach the placental \nbarrier and spread to newborn piglets through vertical transmission. These \ndiscoveries enhance our understanding of the transmission route of porcine RVA \nand have the potential to guide the development of efficient vaccine strategies \nfor combating this disease."}

The subjects of the study were 150 organ transplant \nrecipients (kidney, liver, intestine, simultaneous pancreas and kidney [SPK]) \nwho were at least two months post-transplantation. Stool samples were collected \nfrom each participant, and demographics along with clinical features were \nrecorded. The stool samples underwent parasitological examination, including \ndirect examination, zinc sulfate flotation, formalin-ethyl acetate \nsedimentation, trichrome, and acid-fast staining to detect protozoan and \nhelminthic infections. Samples positive for Blastocystis sp., as well as all \ndiarrheal samples suspected of having microsporidia or intestinal coccidia, were \nfurther investigated using molecular methods. Sequencing was performed on the \nPCR products obtained from 10 Blastocystis samples. The resulting sequences were \nsubmitted to the Blastocystis 18\u00a0S database for GenBank sequence queries.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 46.24 (\u00b1\u200915.13), ranging from 18 \nto 85 years. Among the 150 subjects, 96 (64%) were male and 54 (36%) were \nfemale. The majority had undergone kidney transplantation (52.66%), followed by \nliver transplantation (46%). The participants resided in various provinces of \nIran, with the majority (61.33%) living in Fars province. Overall, 63 (42%) \nindividuals were found to be infected with at least one type of intestinal \nparasite. Blastocystis sp., the most commonly detected parasite, was detected in \n58 (38.66%) cases, Entamoeba coli and Iodamoeba butchlii were each detected in 2 \n(1.33%) cases, while Enterocytozoon bieneusi was identified in 1 (0.66%) case. \nNo helminth infections were detected in any of the subjects. Sequencing of \nBlastocystis sp. revealed subtype 3 (ST3).\nCONCLUSION: The study highlights a high prevalence of intestinal protozoa, \nparticularly Blastocystis sp., among transplant recipients in southern Iran. The \ndetection of E. bieneusi underscores the critical need for greater awareness of \nthese parasitic agents, especially in cases presenting with diarrhea."}

High ambient temperatures are associated \nwith increased morbidity and mortality by infectious diseases, but the effect of \nthese high temperatures indoors remains to be studied.\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of high indoor temperatures on the \nfeelings of illness and heat coping mechanisms in vulnerable populations without \nheat mitigation.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 490 houses in rural villages \nin the coastal area of Chakaria, Bangladesh chosen through stratified cluster \nsampling. It assessed the feelings of illness and their adaptative behaviour to \nhigh temperatures. There were 49 temperature and humidity monitors placed \nindoors to obtain accurate measurements of these parameters in different areas \nand with different house materials. This information was used to determine the \neffect of high indoor temperatures on the symptoms that vulnerable populations \nreported.\nRESULTS: People living in hotter houses reported overall more symptoms, notably, \ndiarrhoea, local site infections and sore throat. Temperatures were higher in \nhouses made of bamboo compared to cement and having shade significantly \ndecreased indoor temperature. Most women in the study reported performing \nadequate heat coping mechanisms. However, these did not show a protective effect \nagainst illness.\nCONCLUSION: This paper showed that high indoor temperatures could be associated \nwith an increase in symptoms.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "diarrhea", "text": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare neurometabolic \ndisorder characterized by diverse neurological and extra-neurological \nmanifestations. In children, chronic diarrhea, neonatal cholestasis, and \ncataracts are characteristics and often precede neurological symptoms, while \nadults typically present with cognitive decline and gait disturbances. This \nvariability contributes to frequent misdiagnosis and delays in diagnosis, \nleading to significant neurological deterioration.\nOBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and genetic diversity of CTX cases in the \nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, comparing the phenotypic differences \nbetween children and adults.\nMETHODS: The retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study included 16 \nclinically and genetically confirmed CTX cases. Data collected encompassed \nclinical presentations, diagnostic delays, biochemical markers such as \ncholestanol levels, neuroimaging findings, and genetic mutations in the CYP27A1 \ngene. Participants were categorized into pediatric and adult groups.\nRESULTS: Common clinical features included cognitive decline (75%), learning \ndifficulties (69%), diarrhea (56%), cataracts (56%), gait issues (50%), and \nbehavioral changes (44%). Notably, childhood diarrhea was strongly associated \nwith earlier diagnosis, with approximately 90% of such cases identified in this \nage group. Misdiagnosis occurred in 3 patients, with an average diagnostic delay \nof 6.1 years-shorter for children (2.7 years) compared to adults (11.6 years). \nTendon xanthoma was observed in only 1 patient. Genetic testing identified 7 \nCYP27A1 variants, highlighting genetic heterogeneity in this population.\nCONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the need for increased physician awareness, \nparticularly regarding pediatric presentations, to reduce diagnostic delays and \nprevent irreversible neurological damage. These findings support integration of \ntargeted genetic testing and early screening programs to improve patient \noutcomes."}

We report results after 18 months of \nadditional follow-up.\nMETHODS: In this ongoing open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients with \nBRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC (59 treatment-na\u00efve and 39 previously treated) received \nencorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily. Primary \nendpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included \nduration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival \n(OS), and safety.\nRESULTS: At this data cutoff, median treatment duration with encorafenib plus \nbinimetinib was 16.3 months in treatment-na\u00efve and 5.5 months in previously \ntreated patients; minimum follow-up was approximately 32 and 22 months, \nrespectively. In treatment-na\u00efve patients, the ORR was 75%, median DOR was 40.0 \nmonths, median PFS was 30.2 months, median OS was not estimable (NE; 95% CI: \n31.3-NE), and the 3-year OS rate was 53%. In previously treated patients, the \nORR was 46%, median DOR was 16.7 months, median PFS was 9.3 months, median OS \nwas 22.7 months, and the 3-year OS rate was 29%. Overall, the most frequent \ntreatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (52%), diarrhea (44%), \nfatigue (33%), and vomiting (30%). TRAEs led to dose reductions and permanent \ntreatment discontinuations in 25 (26%) and 16 (16%) patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: With longer follow-up, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed durable \nand clinically meaningful antitumor activity, especially in treatment-na\u00efve \npatients, with a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant \nmNSCLC."}

This study \naimed to design an in-situ implant-forming system for controlled delivery of \nlevodopa and carbidopa for up to 1 week which will reduce the need for multiple \ndosing. The combination of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA 50:50) and \nEudragit L-100 was used to prepare the implants and the formulation was \noptimized to achieve a controlled release over 7 days. The optimized formulation \ncontaining 26% PLGA and 6% Eudragit L 100 displayed a favorable release profile \nand injectability with low viscosity. The optimized formulation in vitro release \nstudy revealed an initial burst of 34.17% and 37.16% for levodopa and carbidopa \nin the first 24\u00a0h and about 92% and 81% release within 7 days. A good \ncorrelation was observed between the in-vitro drug release data and ex-vivo drug \nrelease with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 for levodopa and 0.90 for \ncarbidopa. Viscosity analysis showed the Newtonian behavior of the formulation. \nSyringeability analysis of the formulation showed that the maximum force \nrequired for expelling the formulation was 32.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72\u00a0N using a 22 G needle. \nThe in-vitro degradation studies revealed 81.89% weight loss of implant in 7 \ndays.

However, sexual health is a poorly explored aspect in these \npatients, and the interaction between eating behavior, psychological factors, \nand sexual function remains insufficiently characterized, although it may \nrepresent a key aspect in clinical management.\nAIMS: To provide a characterization of psychological, eating, and sexual \nfunction characteristics of patients with obesity through an exploratory \nanalysis.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional, single-center study was carried out at Umberto I \nHospital of Sapienza University of Rome (Italy), where patients with obesity \n(body mass index \u226530\u00a0kg/m2) were recruited. Additionally, a control group of \nage-matched, normal-weight (body mass index\u2009=\u200918-25\u00a0kg/m2) subjects was enrolled \nonline. All subjects compiled a series of validated psychometric questionnaires \nthat evaluated psychological distress, disordered eating behaviors, attachment \nstyles, and sexual dysfunction.\nOUTCOMES: To evaluate the psychological distress, attachment style, disordered \neating behavior, and sexual dysfunction in patients with obesity and to explore \nthe correlations between these aspects.\nRESULTS: Seventy-two patients (45 women, mean age 51.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u00a0years and 27 men, \nmean age 39.6\u2009\u00b1\u200916.6\u00a0years) and 76 controls (51 women, mean age \n36.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.3\u00a0years and 25 men, mean age 39.2\u2009\u00b1\u200916.6\u00a0years) were recruited. \nSubjects with obesity reported significantly higher scores in somatization and \nparanoid ideation symptoms, higher scores in food addiction and binge eating \ndomains, and a more fearful attachment style. Women also reported lower sexual \ndesire, arousal, and lubrication, while men showed significantly lower erectile \nfunction, orgasmic intensity, and sexual satisfaction.\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Subjects with obesity are characterized by higher \nsomatization, maladaptive eating behaviors, insecure attachment style, and worse \nsexual function compared to controls, which highlights the necessity of a \nmultidimensional treatment approach.\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: A large and comprehensive battery of questionnaires \nwas employed to examine both the clinical and the control population. However, \nthe absence of stratification by age and the small sample size prevent the \ngeneralizability of the results.\nCONCLUSION: Our results highlight the intricate interplay between psychological, \nbehavioral, and sexual factors in individuals affected by obesity. Further \nstudies should focus on larger and more diverse samples and examine longitudinal \ntrajectories of psychological and sexual health changes in response to \nweight-loss interventions, to assess how such interconnection may help to \nimprove the personalization of care programs."}

Some patients with recurrent comorbidities or severe metabolic \nderangements require a reversal to normal anatomy or physiology.\nOBJECTIVES: To analyze indications, surgical techniques, and outcomes of \nreversal after malabsorptive or maldigestive surgery.\nSETTING: Academic institution, United States.\nMETHODS: Single-center retrospective analysis and systematic literature review \nof reversal after malabsorptive and maldigestive bariatric surgery.\nRESULTS: From January 2005 until November 2022, 19 patients underwent a reversal \nof malabsorptive or maldigestive surgery to normal anatomy (15 Roux-en-Y gastric \nbypass, 4 jejunoileal bypass). The median age was 52 years (21; 74), and 80% of \npatients were female. Median body mass index (BMI) was 23 kg/m2 (17; 38) before \nreversal and 28 kg/m2 (17; 39) after reversal. Indication for reversal was often \nmultifactorial but the most common indications were malnutrition (53%) with \nintractable diarrhea (42%) or hypoglycemia/dumping syndrome (37%). The most \ncommon reversal technique was a single anastomosis gastric bypass reversal (SARR \nprocedure). Postoperative morbidity was 53%, with one major complication \nrequiring reoperation (5%). With the exception of 4 patients who were lost \nduring follow-up, all patients had improvement/resolution of symptoms. Weight \nregain occurred in three patients (16%), and one patient required further weight \nloss intervention (sleeve gastrectomy [SG]). Median follow-up time was 6 months \n(1; 206).\nCONCLUSION: Reversal of a malabsorptive or maldigestive procedure due to \nmetabolic complications is an effective and safe treatment modality. Because of \nthe surgical complexity and its related postoperative morbidity, careful patient \nselection is essential to ensure a favorable postoperative outcome."}

The primary APO was a composite of fetal death \n\u226510 weeks' gestation or pre-eclampsia with severe features or placental \ninsufficiency requiring delivery <34 weeks' gestation. Target sample size was 45 \nwith expected APO rate of 20% with certolizumab versus 40% in historical \ncontrols from a prospectively observed population of similarly managed APS \npregnancies.\nRESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled, and 9 had primary APO (17.6%; 95% CI, \n8.4%-30.9%). Excluding 6 patients who had a pregnancy loss <10 weeks' gestation \nor fetal loss due to genetic abnormalities, primary APO occurred in 9 of the 45 \npatients (20%; 95% CI, 9.6%-34.6%), meeting predetermined criteria for efficacy \nof certolizumab and significantly lower than rates in historical controls. \nMedian gestational age at delivery in certolizumab-treated patients was 36.5 \nweeks and was after 30 weeks in those who met the primary outcome of \npre-eclampsia.

Although factors like baseline \ncharacteristics, body composition, and hormone levels partially explain CTS \nvariability, they leave substantial variability unaccounted for. To address this \ngap, we developed a machine-learning-assisted genetic risk score (CTSGRS) to \npredict high CTS.

The results suggest that agomelatine treatment effectively \ncountered the weight loss associated with AD. Importantly, agomelatine enhanced \ncognitive performance, as indicated by improved short-term memory in spatial \nrecognition assessments; mice treated with agomelatine showed spontaneous \nalternation percentages comparable to controls, with statistically significant \ndifferences observed between AD and control groups (Dunn's post-hoc p\u2009=\u20090.0072). \nAnalyses of biomarkers showed that agomelatine reduced the AD-induced elevation \nof acetylcholinesterase activity, interleukin-6 levels, and oxidative stress \nmarkers while increasing total antioxidant capacity. Histopathological \nassessments showed enhanced structural integrity in hippocampal regions. FTIR \nspectroscopy revealed agomelatine's protective effect on brain molecular \nstructure, mainly through preserving lipid order in the CH stretching region and \npreventing protein oxidation in the C\u2009=\u2009O spectral range, both of which are \ntypically altered by AD pathology.

The aim of the study is to test if spasm as well as the \nincrease of electromyography ( EMG) intensity of extensors in relaxation period \ncould be found during and/or after prolonged asymmetric static loading.\nMETHODS: Twenty six male healthy college students participated in the study. \nParticipants finished two 30\u00a0min asymmetry load conditions (left load(LL), right \nload (RL)), randomly with total load 10\u00a0kg on the left or the right shoulder, \nrespectively. EMG signals were recorded from the left(l) and the right(r) \nthoracic erector spinae (lTES, rTES), lumbar erector spinae (lLES, rTES), and \nhamstring (lHAM, rHAM) muscles in the first 10\u00a0min and the last 10\u00a0min during \nthe interventions, and also recorded in three trunk anterior flexion-extension \nexertions before (pre) and after (post) the interventions, respectively. The \nrhythmic of flexion-extension performance was controlled by a metronome with 5\u00a0s \nflexion and 5\u00a0s extension at 60\u00a0Hz. Spasms were evaluated and an averaged \nelectromyography (NEMG) was calculated for extensors at the first and last \n10\u00a0min of 30\u00a0min intervention, as well as in the relaxation period of FRP during \nflexion-extension exertion in both pre and post the intervention.\nRESULTS: During asymmetry spinal loading process, there was no sign of spasms in \nany of extensors. NEMG of multiple erect spinae had a significant decrease (with \nthe largest -60%, p\u2009=\u20090.021 in rLES in LL) while that of hamstring increases \nsignificantly (the largest value 139%, p\u2009=\u20090.001 in lHAM in LL). After the \ninterventions, the prevalence of spasms in extensors in relaxation period was \nfound with the value from 8 to 55%. Also, NEMG in multiple extensors had a \nsignificant increase (with the largest increase of 114% in lLES in LL, \np\u2009=\u20090.023).\nCONCLUSION: During sustained asymmetry spinal loading, the NEMG in bilateral HAM \nhas significant increase and the NEMG in bilateral erect spinea has a decrease \ntendency. After loading, the NEMG has a significant increase, in parallel with \nspasms elicited in multiple extensors in relation period in flexion-extension \nperformance, with no significant difference between bilateral sides. It may \nindicate that sustained asymmetry spinal loading could lead to a weakness for \ntension ability, and/or a micro-damage in spinal bilateral passive tissues in \nlow back area, the risk of developing low back disorder."}

The study involved seventeen pregnant women undergoing one \nin-person strength training session (IS), one remote strength training session \n(RS), and one control session (CS) in a randomly determined order. The team \nconducted assessments using questionnaires for low back pain, functional \ndisability, and enjoyment. We compared the Generalized Estimating Equations \n(GEE) method with a Bonferroni complementary test (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) and the \nMann-Whitney U test.\nRESULTS: Reduced values of low back pain were found after the session for the \nSUM item in the in-person (\u0394-2.06), remote (\u0394-1.59), and control (\u0394-2.17) \nsessions, as well as for the INTENSITY item in the in-person (\u0394-0.23), remote \n(\u0394-0.12), and control (\u0394-0.3) sessions.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "back pain", "text": "INTRODUCTION: The risk of spondylolysis increases in children and adolescents \ninvolved in sports that involve trunk extension, such as marching bands. \nProlonged posture while playing musical instruments may lead to musculoskeletal \ndisorders. Although many scholars have studied the effects of playing posture on \nlumbar-pelvic kinematics, few have focused on marching band performance.\nPURPOSE: This study assessed the influence of basic posture during marching band \nperformance on lumbar-pelvic kinematics.\nMETHODS: The participants were healthy young adults without musculoskeletal \ninjuries. Gait was measured under three conditions using a three-dimensional \nmovement analysis system: normal gait, gait with a 1.15\u00a0kg trumpet, and marching \nband performance. An analysis of a single right gait cycle was used in this \nstudy to compare the spatiotemporal parameters and joint angles between \nconditions.\nRESULTS: The mean values of the thoracic posterior tilt angle, thoracolumbar \ntransition, lumbar extension angle, and anterior pelvic tilt angle in forward \nmarching were significantly higher than those in free walking and \ninstrument-grasping gait (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The change in the thoracic and lumbar \nrotation angles in forward marching was significantly lower than those in free \nwalking (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nDISCUSSION: Forward marching may increase lumbar extension, heighten shear \nforces, and activate the erector spinae muscles. Restricted upper limb swing may \nhinder the coordination of the erector spinae muscles and impair trunk \nstability.\nCONCLUSION: Increased trunk/pelvic extension and decreased trunk rotation during \nforward marching may lead to overloading of the erector spinae muscle. Attention \nto posture during marching may help prevent low back pain."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "back pain", "text": "BACKGROUND: The transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle plays a crucial role in \nlumbar spine stability and core strength. Activation of the TrA is commonly \nachieved through the abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM). Dysfunction in the \ndeep abdominal muscles is often linked to low back pain and instability. The \nADIM technique involves drawing the navel inward toward the spine while \nmaintaining a neutral spine position and normal breathing, thereby engaging the \nTrA. Sphygmomanometer is a valuable tool for measuring muscle activation, \ntracking changes in pressure, and ensuring core stability and strength during \ntraining.\nMETHODOLOGY: This narrative review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A search \nacross PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and MEDLINE included \nstudies (2010-2024) on ADIM training for TrA activation using a \nsphygmomanometer. RCTs, observational and Systematic review were included. The \nPEDro scale assessed study quality, and two independent reviewers conducted data \nextraction and analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of sixteen studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0833) demonstrated the effectiveness of \nADIM training in activating the TrA muscle, with the sphygmomanometer providing \nhigh reliability (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.995-0.999) in assessing muscle activation. This review \nemphasizes the importance of proper training techniques, including visual cues, \nand biofeedback, to ensure optimal engagement of the deep abdominal muscles.\nCONCLUSION: ADIM training is a highly effective strategy for activating the TrA \nmuscle and improving core stability. Sphygmomanometer provides a reliable and \nobjective measurement of muscle strength and activation. Therefore, ADIM should \nbe integrated into rehabilitation and training programs aimed at enhancing core \nfunction and preventing low back pain."}

However, more definitive research is needed \nto understand how this intervention influences muscle stiffness in individuals \nwith idiopathic chronic neck pain.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a single session of supine cervical \ntraction on stiffness of the upper trapezius (UT) and middle scalene (MS) in \nparticipants with idiopathic chronic neck pain using ultrasound shear wave \nelastography.\nMETHODS: We recruited 18 participants (14\u00a0F, 4\u00a0M) exhibiting mild-to-moderate \nidiopathic chronic neck pain and 17 healthy controls (12\u00a0F, 5\u00a0M) for this study. \nCervical traction was applied using a 9\u00a0kg force for 6 sets of 5\u00a0min with breaks \nin between. Ultrasound shear wave elastography images were acquired bilaterally \nfrom two UT sites and one MS site before and after the cervical traction session \nto measure muscle stiffness and at 2.5\u00a0min and 5\u00a0min into each set for one \nrandomized location.\nRESULTS: Cervical traction significantly reduced stiffness in both UT sites \nduring a 5-min application of traction (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but did not \nsignificantly affect MS stiffness (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). However, the effects were \ntemporary as stiffness for all six muscle sites returned to their baseline \nlevels after the 30\u00a0min session was completed.\nCONCLUSION: A single session of cervical neck traction reduces the stiffness of \nthe upper trapezius muscles while traction forces are applied, but these changes \ndo not persist after removing traction."}

However, it is unknown whether \nadministering accurate pressure by an algometer is more successful than the \nusual method of pressure release by hand in producing therapeutic effects. This \nstudy examined the effects of manual pressure release (MPR) and algometer \npressure release (APR) on the latent myofascial trigger points (MTrP) of the \nupper trapezius muscle.\nMETHODS: In this clinical trial, 40 patients with latent MTrP of the upper \ntrapezius were randomly allocated to the MPR (n: 20) or APR groups (n: 20). \nTreatments were applied for 5 sessions over 2 weeks. Pain, neck range of motion, \npressure pain threshold, and morphometric indications were examined using a \nvisual analog scale, goniometry, algometer, and ultrasonography, respectively. \nUltrasonography was used to evaluate the penetration angle, muscle thickness, \nL-mean (muscle echogenicity), and standard deviation of echogenicity. Before \ntreatment, at the end of the fifth session, and 2 weeks following the \nintervention (follow-up session), measurements were taken at rest and during \ncontraction of the upper trapezius muscle at 90\u00b0of shoulder abduction.\nRESULTS: At the end of treatment (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and follow-up session (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015), \nthe pressure-pain threshold was significantly higher in the APR group than in \nthe MPR group. In contrast, the penetration angle at rest (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and during \ncontraction (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and the L-mean during contraction (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) were \nsignificantly reduced in the MPR group compared with the APR group.\nCONCLUSION: The APR approach assisted in raising the pressure pain threshold, \nwhereas the MPR technique was more efficient at enhancing the morphological \nmarkers of the upper trapezius with latent MTrp."}

Trends were assessed by age, sex, and \nsociodemographic index (SDI). Bayesian age-period-cohort models (BAPC) predicted \nfuture burden up to 2035.\nRESULTS: Between 1990 and 2021, the global age-standardized prevalence rate of \neating disorders increased from 300.73 to 354.72 per 100,000 population (EAPC: \n0.57).

A total of 48 \nhealthy adults were randomised (6:2) across six dose cohorts (0.375, 0.75, 1.5, \n3, 6 and 9\u2009mg) to receive Efsubaglutide Alfa or placebo. Safety, PK and PD \nparameters were assessed.\nRESULTS: Efsubaglutide Alfa exhibited dose-proportional PK, with a median Tmax \nof 47.5-71.7\u2009h and a mean half-life (T1/2) of 121.4\u2009h. Exposure increased \nlinearly across doses (Cmax: 37.1-832.4\u2009ng/mL, AUC0-\u221e: 8699.6-193446.6\u2009ng/mL\u00b7h). \nNo serious AEs occurred; mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, \nvomiting, decreased appetite) were the most common in Efsubaglutide Alfa-treated \nsubjects. Post-dose, fasting plasma glucose transiently declined on Day 1, \nreturned to baseline by Day 2, and remained within -0.8 to +1.9\u2009mmol/L relative \nto baseline (within expected physiological variability) through Day 28. Fasting \ninsulin and C-peptide levels slightly increased on Day 1, normalised by Day 2, \nand remained stable. At Day 2, OGTT revealed reduced glucose excursions in \nEfsubaglutide Alfa recipients (p\u2009=\u20090.0150 vs. placebo; AUC ~0.7\u2009mmol/L\u00b72\u2009h \nlower), while insulin and C-peptide levels remained unchanged. Dose-dependent \nweight loss peaked at Day 4-7, with up to a 4.0% reduction (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) at the \nhigher dose, followed by a gradual return towards baseline by Day 28.\nCONCLUSIONS: Efsubaglutide Alfa was well tolerated in healthy participants, with \na favourable PK and PD profiles that support further clinical development in \ntype 2 diabetes and metabolic disorders."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "loss of appetite", "text": "INTRODUCTION: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the process of \ntransferring fecal microbiota from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal \ntract of a recipient. Although many mechanisms of FMT are still not completely \nunderstood at present, it has been described that the treatment of various \ngastrointestinal diseases in different species, including humans, is \nsignificantly improved by FMT therapy. Since the first report on FMT therapy in \nveterinary medicine in small mammals numerous cases have been reported, but \nlittle information has been published on the therapeutic effects of FMT \ntreatment in reptiles. The present case report describes the effects of orally \nadministered fecal microbiota transplantation in a Mediterranean spur-thighed \ntortoise (Testudo graeca) suffering from chronic gastrointestinal disorders.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A nine-year-old, 330\u202fg, intact female Mediterranean \nspur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) from the animal owner's own offspring was \npresented for consultation due to decreased general condition, anorexia and \nsialorrhea following oral intake of a lettuce species (Lactuca virosa) known for \nits poisonous plant ingredients (sesquiterpene lactones) 3\u202fweeks prior to \npresentation. Pre-existing conditions were not reported. Clinical examination \nrevealed sialorrhea and a reduced general condition. Diagnostic procedures \nincluded blood chemistry, radiography and ultrasonography. Despite repeated \ntreatment attempts with various medical regimes over 158\u202fdays, the tortoise \ncontinued showing variable recurring gastrointestinal symptoms. An orally \nadministered FMT was initiated and continued for a total of 3\u202fweeks. \nGastrointestinal signs improved rapidly within 1\u202fweek and resolved completely \nafter 3\u202fweeks. Over a follow up period of 9\u202fmonths, no symptom recurrence or \nadverse effects were monitored.\nCONCLUSION: This case report describes the first successful trial of fecal \nmicrobiota transplantation in chelonians. The outcome indicates that this \ntherapeutic approach may be beneficial not only to small animals but also for \nthe therapy of gastrointestinal disorders in reptiles, especially those cases \nwith insufficient conventional therapy results."}

Coptis japonica Makino (CJM) is a medicinal herb \nwidely used in Asia, known for its anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory \nproperties. However, its potential role in cancer cachexia has not yet been \nexplored. This research aimed to explore the potential of CJM extracts (CJME) in \nmitigating cancer cachexia in both myotubes treated with CT26 conditioned medium \n(CM) and in a CT26-induced cancer cachexia mouse model. Our results demonstrated \nthat CJME significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of muscle-specific \nE3 ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 in myotubes exposed to CT26 CM. \nFurthermore, CJME notably enhanced the protein levels of myosin heavy chain \n(MyHC). In the mouse model of CT26-induced cancer cachexia, severe loss of \nmuscle and fat was observed. however, CJME effectively countered this wasting \nand restored abnormal biochemical parameters such as CK, albumin, triglycerides \n(TG), cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein \n(LDL) associated with cancer cachexia. Moreover, CJME reduced interleukin-6 \n(IL-6) levels in both CT26 CM-stimulated myotubes and the serum of CT26-induced \ncancer cachexia mice. The mechanism underlying these effects appears to involve \nthe suppression of STAT3 activation by CJME. These findings suggest that CJME \nhas potential as a therapeutic candidate in the management of cancer cachexia."}

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 31\u202fU/L, aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) was 35\u202fU/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 175\u202fU/L. The \npatient had a five-year history of recurrent episodes, previously resolving \nspontaneously or with medical treatment. Following liver biopsy diagnosis and \nfailure of conventional therapy, she underwent plasmapheresis on alternate days. \nFour sessions of one plasma volume exchange, using albumin, were performed \nconcurrently with medical treatment. The patient demonstrated rapid and \nsignificant improvement in pruritus and urine color, with no adverse events or \nneed for fresh frozen plasma. Total bilirubin decreased progressively to \n5\u202fmg/dL, and direct bilirubin to 4\u202fmg/dL.\nCONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis appears to be a beneficial adjunct therapy for \nrefractory BRIC, effectively reducing bilirubin levels and alleviating pruritus. \nThis intervention may improve patient quality of life and potentially prevent \nrenal complications associated with hyperbilirubinemia, serving as a bridge to \nliver transplantation, if necessary."}

We \ndeveloped an average clinical pathway based on data from three Finnish \nuniversity hospitals to estimate resource use. The model captured health-related \nquality of life, potential adverse events, device upgrades, and device failure. \nWe estimated unit costs from national expert opinions and from grey and \npublished literature. We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to \nevaluate how uncertain model inputs affect the incremental cost-effectiveness \nratio (ICER).\nRESULTS: The ICER for UCIs compared to hearing aids in the Finnish adult \npopulation was \u20ac14,528 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The \ncost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated a 98,5% likelihood that UCIs \nare cost-effective compared to a \u20ac25,000 per QALY gained threshold. The ICER was \nmost sensitive to the discount rate, UCI device and surgery costs, the utility \nincrement from UCI treatment, costs associated with UCI fitting, and the cost \nand upgrade cycle of sound processors.\nCONCLUSION: UCIs for adults are cost-effective within the Finnish healthcare \nsetting. Our results align with ICER findings for UCIs in the UK and Swedish \nadult populations, despite differences in indications, clinical pathways, and \ndevice unit costs. All studies suggest that UCIs are more cost-effective when \nimplemented at an earlier age, given the same level of hearing performance."}

Recent research suggests that acoustic background noise can \nenhance neural speech tracking, enabling the auditory system to robustly encode \nspeech even under unfavorable conditions. Aging and hearing loss are associated \nwith internal, neural noise in the auditory system, raising the question whether \nadditional acoustic background noise enhances neural speech tracking in older \nadults. In the current electroencephalography study, younger (\u223c25.5 years) and \nolder adults (\u223c68.5 years) listened to spoken stories in quiet (clear) or in the \npresence of background noise at a wide range of different signal-to-noise \nratios. In younger adults, early neural speech tracking responses (<0.15\u202fs) were \nenhanced by minimal background noise, indicating response facilitation through \nnoise. In contrast, older adults, compared to younger adults, showed enhanced \nneural speech tracking for clear speech and speech masked by minimal background \nnoise, but the acoustic noise led to little enhancement of the early neural \ntracking response in older people. The data demonstrate different sensitivity of \nthe auditory cortex to speech masked by noise between younger and older adults. \nThe results are consistent with the idea that the auditory cortex of older \npeople exhibits more internal, neural noise that enhances neural speech tracking \nbut that additional acoustic noise does not further support speech encoding.

Brain functional connectivity \ncoefficients were used to construct graph data analyzed with a graph attention \nnetwork (GAT) model for categorization. Analyses focused on the auditory network \n(AN), salience network (SN), and default mode network (DMN) and their \ncorrelations with tinnitus severity.\nRESULTS: Both SSNHL groups showed reduced connectivity within the SN and DMN, \nwhich correlated with tinnitus severity. Notably, COV-SSNHL patients exhibited \ndistinct, complex network remodeling involving the AN, SN, and DMN, with the \ndorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as a central mediator.

The basal ganglia, involved in voluntary and automatic movements, are \naffected by reduced dopaminergic activity, contributing to motor signs in PD. \nMotor signs may be exacerbated by cortical white matter hyperintensities (WMH), \nbut the relationship between basal ganglia WMH and motor signs remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between subcortical WMH burden and \nmotor severity in PD participants.\nMETHOD: This cross-sectional study included 140 PD participants from the Ontario \nNeurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI). The relative WMH (i.e, \npercentage) in the whole brain, frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobes, \nand basal ganglia+thalamus (BGT) were calculated. Adjusted regression models \nwere used to test the associations between WMH and motor signs. WMH burden was \nstratified by quartiles, and Analysis of Covariance was applied to determine \nwhich WMH quartile most affected motor signs.\nRESULTS: Increased WMH burden in BGT was associated with better motor function. \nIn contrast, WMH burden in cortical brain regions, i.e., frontal, parietal, \ntemporal, and occipital lobes, was not associated with worse motor signs. \nParticipants with larger BGT WMH volumes exhibited better motor function \ncompared to those in lower quartiles CONCLUSION: Hyperintense lesions in the \nbasal ganglia+thalamus were significantly associated with better motor function, \nsuggesting that disruption of inhibitory basal ganglia circuitry may recalibrate \nmotor output. These findings raise novel hypotheses about circuit-level \nmodulation in Parkinson's disease and may guide future mechanistic and \ntherapeutic investigations. However, as the results are correlational, they do \nnot imply causality."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "tremors", "text": "Cerebellar dysfunction causes various movement disorders, including ataxia, \ndystonia, and tremor. Previous work demonstrated that spike patterns in \ncerebellar nuclei neurons were distinct between different movement disorder \nmouse models. However, often these changes arise from neural dysfunction in the \ncerebellar cortex, through misfiring, miswiring, or degenerating Purkinje cells. \nEven though Purkinje cells form the sole output from the cerebellar cortex, \ntheir information is relayed to other regions of the motor network via \ncerebellar nuclei cells. Purkinje cells make GABAergic synapses onto cerebellar \nnuclei cells, and it is often assumed that changes in Purkinje cell spike \npatterns result in inverse changes in nuclei cell spike patterns. Here, we test \nthis hypothesis by answering the question of whether a reliable relationship \nbetween Purkinje cell and nuclei cell spike patterns exists. Single-cell, in \nvivo electrophysiology recordings of both cell types from six mouse models for \ncerebellar movement disorders were analyzed according to parameters relating to \nspike rate and irregularity. We investigated whether Purkinje cell spike \npatterns correlated with nuclei cell spike patterns. We found that some \nparameters for firing irregularity were positively correlated between Purkinje \nand nuclei cells but no - and particularly no inverse - relationship was \nobserved between Purkinje and nuclei cell spike rate. Overall, this study begins \nto illuminate that the relationship between Purkinje cells and nuclei cell spike \nactivity in a disease state is more complex and unpredictable. The data suggest \nPurkinje cell spike activity changes cannot accurately predict nuclei cell \nchanges, which ultimately drive cerebellar disease states. Our findings \nunderscore the importance of studying cerebellar nuclei cell function in \ncerebellar disease, as lack of changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns can mask \ndisease-causing firing patterns in these cerebellar output cells."}

To explore the phenomenological dimension of physical \ncraving in addiction, we measured self-reported body sensations of craving among \nindividuals with subclinical (binge drinking, BD) or clinical (severe alcohol \nuse disorder, SAUD) alcohol use disorders.\nMETHODS: We used a body mapping technique, allowing for the free report of \nthe\u00a0bodily counterparts of psychological phenomena, among 76 binge drinkers and \n97 recently detoxified patients with SAUD. We measured the taxonomy, \nlocalization, intensity, and pleasantness of the craving bodily sensations.\nRESULTS: Physical sensations of craving were reported (1) for individuals with \nBD habits, mostly in the shoulders/thorax (53.95%), mouth (47.37%), and forehead \n(31.58%), in the form of palpitations, dryness, and tension; (2) for patients \nwith SAUD, most often and with the highest average intensity in the hands \n(31.96%), forehead (24.74%), and shoulders/thorax (22.68%), in the form of \ntremors, perspiration, and palpitations. In BD, craving sensations were \ndescribed as slightly unpleasant to pleasant. Conversely, in SAUD patients, \ncraving was perceived as slightly to very unpleasant.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings bring forth a novel perspective of the bodily \nmechanisms involved in craving. They support a dissociation between subclinical \nand clinical populations of excessive alcohol drinkers, as body sensations \nrelated to craving might generate alcohol consumption through positive \nreinforcement (to extend positive sensations) for subclinical populations and \nthrough negative reinforcement (to alleviate unpleasant body sensations) for \nclinical populations. More widely, we highlight the need to add perceived bodily \nsensations to the predominantly and exclusively cognitive focus that \ncharacterizes the craving research field, since craving is also underpinned by \nphysical sensations."}

We measured the taxonomy, \nlocalization, intensity, and pleasantness of the craving bodily sensations.\nRESULTS: Physical sensations of craving were reported (1) for individuals with \nBD habits, mostly in the shoulders/thorax (53.95%), mouth (47.37%), and forehead \n(31.58%), in the form of palpitations, dryness, and tension; (2) for patients \nwith SAUD, most often and with the highest average intensity in the hands \n(31.96%), forehead (24.74%), and shoulders/thorax (22.68%), in the form of \ntremors, perspiration, and palpitations. In BD, craving sensations were \ndescribed as slightly unpleasant to pleasant. Conversely, in SAUD patients, \ncraving was perceived as slightly to very unpleasant.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings bring forth a novel perspective of the bodily \nmechanisms involved in craving. They support a dissociation between subclinical \nand clinical populations of excessive alcohol drinkers, as body sensations \nrelated to craving might generate alcohol consumption through positive \nreinforcement (to extend positive sensations) for subclinical populations and \nthrough negative reinforcement (to alleviate unpleasant body sensations) for \nclinical populations. More widely, we highlight the need to add perceived bodily \nsensations to the predominantly and exclusively cognitive focus that \ncharacterizes the craving research field, since craving is also underpinned by \nphysical sensations."}

It is crucial for the discipline of \ncardiology to address the special difficulties that come with diagnosing and \ntreating these two diseases together. The goal of this case report is to provide \na comprehensive overview of the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, \nand treatment strategies for this uncommon cardiac disease in a resource-limited \nsetting.\nCASE PRESENTATION: This is a case involving a 50-year-old Ethiopian female \npatient referred to our hospital for cardiac evaluation. She presented with \nintermittent palpitation to a nearby health center, which was diagnosed as \nrheumatic heart disease, for which she was on intramuscular benzathine \npenicillin injection on a monthly basis. Otherwise, she had no history \nsuggestive of acute rheumatic fever and no chest pain, body swelling, orthopnea, \nor paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, historically or on current presentation. \nEvaluations revealed that her chest was clear and resonant with good air entry, \nand flat jugular venous pressure, but she had a grade III pansystolic murmur \nbest heard at the apex that radiates to the left axilla. No other pertinent \nphysical examination findings were discovered. Echocardiographic evaluation \nrevealed a tiny cyst at the apex of posterior mitral valve leaflet with \ninteratrial septal bulging into the right atrium.\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac blood cysts are an uncommon congenital cardiac condition \nthat can lead to stroke and other potentially fatal consequences, especially if \nthey are situated on the mitral valve. With improved specialists and low-risk \nprocedures, surgical removal is advised. Given the patient's state, a proper \ndiagnosis was therefore essential to provide her with accessible management \noptions in this setting while she waits for a definitive surgical treatment in \ncase the need arises."}

Resistance to direct \ncurrent cardioversion (DCCV) is uncommon and can be clinically challenging. \nLifestyle factors, including dietary stimulant intake, may influence arrhythmia \ndynamics and treatment responsiveness. We present a case of a 26-year-old female \nknown to have SVT, who presented with six hours of palpitations, with a past \nmedical history of successful cryoablation performed in 2021 for atrial \ntachycardia originating from tissue near the atrioventricular bundle.

The pharmacological intervention failed to achieve rhythm control, \nnecessitating DCCV. Despite appropriate sedation and energy dosing, initial \ncardioversion attempts were unsuccessful. Subsequent higher-energy shocks \nultimately restored sinus rhythm. This case underscores an unusual presentation \nof cardioversion-resistant SVT in a young adult with prior ablation. The \npatient's habitual intake of energy drinks raises concern for potential \npro-arrhythmic and electrophysiologic alterations induced by high caffeine and \nother stimulant content. While caffeine's arrhythmogenic potential is \nrecognized, its role in altering myocardial excitability and threshold for \ncardioversion is not well established. This case adds to the limited literature \nsuggesting that excessive stimulant use may contribute to treatment-resistant \narrhythmic episodes.

Percutaneous \nballoon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is often limited in these cases due to valve \nrigidity, increasing the risk of mitral regurgitation (MR). Transcatheter mitral \nvalve lithotripsy (TMVL) is an emerging technique that uses sonic waves to \ndisrupt calcification, enhancing valve pliability and PBMV outcomes. A \n39-year-old woman, 18 weeks pregnant, with a history of rheumatic heart disease \nand prior surgical mitral commissurotomy, presented with palpitations, fatigue, \nand exertional breathlessness. She had severe MS (mitral valve area 0.8\u2009cm\u00b2) and \nsevere tricuspid regurgitation, with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular \nresponse. Due to a high Wilkins score, PBMV was attempted with a 28\u2009mm Inoue \nballoon inflated to 28\u2009mm, but was suboptimal due to significant valve rigidity. \nAdjunctive TMVL improved valve pliability, successfully reducing the mitral \ngradient and increasing valve area without worsening MR.

IST is associated with symptomatic palpitation \ndescribed as an abrupt transient acceleration of HR at rest or minimal activity \nand is often associated with multiple psychosomatic symptoms. Self-sustained \ncontractile activity, i.e., pace-making, is the basic physiological process \ncharacterizing the sinus node. The funny current (If) initially described in \nsinus node myocytes is a mixed Na/K cation channel that is slowly activated upon \nthe hyperpolarization of the sinoatrial node's myocytes. This inward current \ngenerates repetitive activity responsible for the rhythmic pacemaker activity. \nThe higher the activation of If current, the steeper will be phase 4 hence \ngreater the frequency of action potential firing, i.e., HR. Dysfunctional funny \nchannels have been identified as playing a critical role in the development of \nIST, alongside the external influences stemming from modulatory actions of the \nautonomic nervous and humoral systems. Beta-blockers and calcium channel \nblockers are current first-line therapies that often require high doses, but are \nusually inefficient and poorly tolerated. Ivabradine has been shown to have \nunique properties of blocking If current at low concentration with a \nuse-dependent way, which manifests as a slowly progressing accumulation of the \ndrug during repetitive channel activation/deactivation cycles. Thus, unlike \nbeta-blockers, Ivabradine, in smaller doses, results in a more substantial \nblocking effect at higher tachycardic rates and, therefore, more successful in \nthe treatment of IST. The current literature review, which includes a small \nnumber of patients, has shown that Ivabradine lowered basal, mean, and maximal \nHR and was associated with symptomatic improvement. We have described the unique \nand specific mechanism of action, along with its safety profile, which supports \nIvabradine's role as the first-line therapy for the resolution of IST."}

Adults with OAB or overactive bladder \nsymptom score (OABSS)\u2009\u2265\u20093 were included. Trials evaluating vibegron \n(monotherapy/combination) and mirabegron combination therapies were eligible. \nExcluded were nonrandomized studies, secondary OAB, and long-term cardiovascular \ndisease cases. Primary outcomes included micturition frequency (MF), urgency \nepisodes (UE), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mean voided volume (MVV). \nSecondary outcomes were adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation \n(AELTD), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (sAEs), dry mouth, and \nconstipation. Data analysis used the netmeta R package with both NMAs and cNMA.\nRESULTS: Twelve studies (11,374 participants) were included. Vibegron \noutperformed mirabegron and antimuscarinics in reducing micturition frequency, \nwith 100\u00a0mg vibegron showing the greatest reduction (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.87, 95% \nCI\u2009-\u20091.16 to\u2009-\u20090.59). Combination therapies generally had better efficacy in \nimproving UE and UUI than monotherapies, except mirabegron 50\u00a0mg\u2009+\u2009tamsulosin. \nNo significant MVV differences between treatments and controls. For AEs, there \nwere no significant differences in overall AEs or AELTD between treatments and \ncontrols. But higher doses and combination therapies had higher risks of dry \nmouth and constipation. Component network meta-analysis (cNMA) showed greater \nreductions in micturition frequency, suggesting possible negative interactions, \nwhereas standard NMA showed synergistic effects on urgency episodes (UE) and \nmean voided volume (MVV).\nCONCLUSION: \u03b23-agonists, especially vibegron, are effective for OAB symptoms (MF \nand UUI), both alone and with antimuscarinics.

UI can be managed through qualified early assessment, \npossibly reducing associated health care costs. However, limited studies have \nestimated the economic burden of UI in the European Union (EU). This study \nestimates the economic burden of UI on individuals, carers, health systems, \nlong-term care, and society in the EU.\nMETHODS: Prevalence data were extracted or estimated to inform the \nepidemiological burden of UI in the EU. The economic burden of UI in 27 EU \nmember states was then estimated, which included direct and indirect \nproductivity losses and incontinence pad disposal costs. The 2023 results were \npresented, and projections for 2030 were estimated for future costs if no \npreventative action is taken. All costs were expressed in euros (EUR\u20ac).\nKEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In 2023, the EU economic burden of UI was EUR\u20ac69.1 \nbillion (EUR\u20ac26.1-133.4 billion) without caregiver costs, with females bearing \nquadruple the burden compared with males. On average, per-patient annual costs \nwere EUR\u20ac1,470.6. Caregiver costs increased EU economic burden to EUR\u20ac80.0 \nbillion (EUR\u20ac32.5-150.6 billion) with per-patient per-year costs increasing to \nEUR\u20ac1,700.0. In 2030, the economic burden could rise to EUR\u20ac100.2 billion \n(EUR\u20ac40.8-188.6 billion). Shifting to 100% incontinence pad waste recycling \ncould reduce the overall carbon footprint of continence health in Europe by \n117.8 million kg CO2e in 2023.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A high UI economic burden emphasises the \neconomic and environmental benefits of prevention. The results highlight the \nneed for recognising the high economic burden in women, improved prevalence data \nsurveillance driving effective prevention strategies, and formally recognising \nsecondary caregivers in the UI treatment pathway."}

To identify associated \nfactors with the recovery of urinary continence.\nMETHODS: A quasi-experimental, pre-/post-intervention, without control group \nstudy was conducted. Participants were aged 65 and over with a history of \nurinary incontinence less than one year of current from the Functional Recovery \nUnit of Guadarrama Hospital throughout a convenience sampling. Patients were on \na prompted voiding programme throughout their hospitalisation, individualizing \nfor a voiding diary. Data were collected from October 2019 to March 2020. A \ndescriptive, pre-post intervention, prediction and logistic regression analysis \nwere conducted using SPSS 25 and STATA 15 software. The study was approved by \nthe reference Ethics Committee.\nRESULTS: 57 patients were included, 86% of them were female (n\u2009=\u200949) who were \n82.1 age mean (SD\u2009=\u20099.4). The 56.1% (n\u2009=\u200932) experienced new-onset mixed urinary \nincontinence and the mean hospital stay was 40.5 (SD:14.7) days. 35.1% (n\u2009=\u200920) \nachieved urinary continence and reduced the number of urine leaks in those \npatients who remained incontinent upon discharge (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). Factors associated \nwith the recovery of urinary continence were functional ability upon discharge \n(p\u2009<\u20090.001), frequency of the episodes of urinary incontinence on admission \n(p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), frequency of toilet use on admission (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), lessened hospital \nstays (p\u2009=\u20090.041), reduction of the risk of the appearance of pressure wounds \n(p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: Prompted voiding has been shown to be effective in restoring urinary \ncontinence in more than a third of the patients studied. Having better \nfunctional ability and more frequency of toilet use on admission were associated \nwith the programme's success. It prevents skin wounds and reduces dependency \nlevel."}

Previously, we identified wheelchair use, VP shunt \npresence, and urinary incontinence as predictors of bowel control. Bowel control \ncan be predicted in anorectal malformations, predictions for patients with spina \nbifida or spinal cord injuries have not been established.\nMETHODS: Single-center, retrospective, observational study including patients 4 \nyears or older at last follow-up, seen at Children's Hospital Colorado \nmultidisciplinary spina bifida and spinal cord injury clinic, September 2020 to \nJanuary 2023.\nRESULTS: FI was seen in 73% of patients. FI patients had higher end-fill \npressures (EFP) (median 25 vs. 20 cmH2O), lower leak point pressures (mean 42.55 \nvs. 50.74 cmH2O). Analysis of 142 children younger than four, found; greater \nfilling pressure changes (median 20 vs. 15 cmH2O), post-void residual volumes \n(median 20 vs. 5 ml), lower leak point pressures (mean 43.0 vs. 52.85 cmH2O). On \nmultiple logistic regression wheelchair users (OR 2.71) and EFP greater than \n24.5 cmH2O (OR 2.71) had increased odds for FI.\nCONCLUSIONS: Before age 4 urodynamics are useful to predict FI in spina bifida \nand spinal cord injury patients. A cutoff of 24.5 cmH2O in EFP is the best \npredictor in urodynamics."}

In women, sexual \ndysfunction following ALIF is rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to \ninvestigate the frequency of postoperative changes in sexual function and \nincontinence in women following ALIF.\nMETHODS: For this study, 173 female patients aged 18 to 60 years who had \nundergone a primary ALIF surgery in 2015 to 2022 in a large spine center to \nretrospectively answer a questionnaire about sexual function and incontinence \npre- and postoperatively; they were also asked to rate their satisfaction with \nthe surgery. McNemar tests were used to compare the prevalence of specific \nproblems pre- vs postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Of all respondents (n = 84), 23 (27%) reported a worsening of sexual \nfunction following ALIF surgery, and these changes were persistent in 83% of \nthose patients. Among individual symptoms of sexual dysfunction, the highest \nincrease was observed for the prevalence of vaginal dryness, which increased \nfrom 12% preoperatively to 32% postoperatively (P < 0.001), followed by \ndyspareunia, which increased from 8% to 21% (P = 0.001). Urinary incontinence \nincreased from 25% to 41% (P < 0.001). Patient age, level of surgery, and fusion \nmaterial were not associated with worsening of sexual function. However, \nworsening of sexual function was associated with a lower level of satisfaction \nwith the surgery outcome and a lower proportion of patients who would have the \nsurgery again.\nCONCLUSIONS: Female patients undergoing ALIF should receive adequate \npreoperative information about potential changes in sexual function to enable \nthem to make an informed decision.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: An improved understanding among patients will lead to more \nrealistic patient expectations and higher patient satisfaction."}

Given that nurses \nare particularly susceptible to nocturia due to frequent shift work, poor \nurination habits, and heavy workloads, this study aims to investigate the \nprevalence of nocturia among nurses and its effects on their psychosocial \nfunctions, as well as the mediating role of sleep quality.\nMETHODS: 105 hospitals, comprising 46,391 valid samples, were conveniently \nselected between February 2021 and March 2024, based on the baseline survey of \nthe Chinese Nurses' Health Cohort Study (TARGET). Variables were measured by the \nInternational Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety \nDisorder 7-Item Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Work-Family Balance \nScale, 6-item Stanford Presenteeism Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. \nUnivariate and binomial logistic regression analyses, correlation analyses, and \nmediation model tests were employed.\nRESULTS: Nocturia (frequency\u2009\u2265\u20092 times/night) was observed in 7,265 (15.7%) and \npoor sleep quality in 19,002 (41.0%) among nurses. Sleep quality partially \nmediated the relationship among nocturia-anxiety, nocturia-depression, \nnocturia-health-related productivity loss, and nocturia-work-family balance, \nwith mediation effects of 1.080, 1.368, 0.538, and -\u20091.112, accounting for \n79.70%, 78.05%, 71.68%, and 89.56% of the total effect, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nocturia adversely affects nurses' psychosocial functions, and \nsleep quality mediates this relationship.

Untreated urinary incontinence is associated with reduced quality of \nlife, amongst others. Pelvic floor muscle training is the first-line treatment. \nExisting evidence on the proportion of physiotherapy care remains limited, \nparticularly regarding men with urinary incontinence, and insufficiently \naccounts for care situation- or age-specific disparities. This study \ninvestigated the proportion of physiotherapy care, differentiated by age, sex, \ncare situation, informal provider networks, and temporal trends, to address \nthese evidence gaps.\nMETHOD: We analysed health insurance fund claims data covering a period of 9 \nyears (2008-2016), from up to 6,433,070 individuals aged 65+, and applied a \nnetwork approach to identify patient sharing networks. We calculated the \nproportion of physiotherapy care on a quarterly basis.\nRESULTS: The proportion of physiotherapy care remained relatively stable over \ntime. In the first quarter of 2016, it was 10.5% for people with incident \nurinary incontinence in total, 7.9% for those without care, 11.9% for people \nwith home care, and 14.0% for nursing home residents. The lowest proportion of \nphysiotherapy care (3.5%) was found among men with incident urinary incontinence \nin the 85 to 89 age group receiving no care, and the highest proportion (19.3%) \namong women with incident urinary incontinence in the age group 70 to 74 years \nliving in a nursing home. The variation in the proportion of physiotherapy care \nbetween patient sharing networks was the highest for women and men in nursing \nhomes (SD 9.7% and 9.2%, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a systematic underuse of physiotherapy \nservices for both sexes across all age groups and care situations. Older men \nwithout care needs are particularly at risk for underuse."}

Adults with OAB or overactive bladder \nsymptom score (OABSS)\u2009\u2265\u20093 were included. Trials evaluating vibegron \n(monotherapy/combination) and mirabegron combination therapies were eligible. \nExcluded were nonrandomized studies, secondary OAB, and long-term cardiovascular \ndisease cases. Primary outcomes included micturition frequency (MF), urgency \nepisodes (UE), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mean voided volume (MVV). \nSecondary outcomes were adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation \n(AELTD), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (sAEs), dry mouth, and \nconstipation. Data analysis used the netmeta R package with both NMAs and cNMA.\nRESULTS: Twelve studies (11,374 participants) were included. Vibegron \noutperformed mirabegron and antimuscarinics in reducing micturition frequency, \nwith 100\u00a0mg vibegron showing the greatest reduction (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.87, 95% \nCI\u2009-\u20091.16 to\u2009-\u20090.59). Combination therapies generally had better efficacy in \nimproving UE and UUI than monotherapies, except mirabegron 50\u00a0mg\u2009+\u2009tamsulosin. \nNo significant MVV differences between treatments and controls. For AEs, there \nwere no significant differences in overall AEs or AELTD between treatments and \ncontrols. But higher doses and combination therapies had higher risks of dry \nmouth and constipation. Component network meta-analysis (cNMA) showed greater \nreductions in micturition frequency, suggesting possible negative interactions, \nwhereas standard NMA showed synergistic effects on urgency episodes (UE) and \nmean voided volume (MVV).\nCONCLUSION: \u03b23-agonists, especially vibegron, are effective for OAB symptoms (MF \nand UUI), both alone and with antimuscarinics. For short-term treatment, \ncombination therapies seem superior to monotherapies in symptom control."}

This systematic review and \nmeta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluates the efficacy and \nsafety of ondansetron, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, as adjunctive \ntreatment for the management of schizophrenia, especially the negative symptoms.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, \nScopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science, was performed in October 2024. We included \nonly randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and their data were extracted and \nanalyzed using RevMan 5.4 software. The primary outcome was the PANSS (Positive \nand Negative Syndrome Scale) negative subscale.\nRESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 533 patients were included in the study. \nOndansetron showed a statistically significant improvement in PANSS negative \nsubscale at 12\u00a0weeks [pooled as mean difference, MD\u00a0=\u00a0-2.96, 95\u00a0% CI [-4.69, \n-1.24], P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.00007] and in general psychopathology scale [MD\u00a0=\u00a0-2.71, \n95\u00a0% CI [-3.52, -1.90] compared to placebo. However, ondansetron and placebo did \nnot differ in reduction of PANSS positive subscale [MD\u00a0=\u00a00.1, 95\u00a0% CI [-1.19, \n1.38], P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.88], and depression scale. Ondansetron showed no significant \ndifference regarding tardive dyskinesia between the two groups. However, \nconstipation was significant in the ondansetron group over placebo.\nCONCLUSION: The study findings provide valuable insights into the efficacy of \nondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, in managing schizophrenia, \nparticularly negative symptoms. However, the limitations of the study highlight \nthe need for caution in interpreting these results. Further high-quality trials \nare required to confirm our findings and explore the long-term impact of \nondansetron in the treatment of schizophrenia."}

The criteria for choosing one \ntherapy over the other are debated.\nOBJECTIVES: Identify factors influencing the choice of early surgical \nintervention over biologic therapy.\nDESIGN: Retrospective.\nSETTING: Single center, tertiary training and research hospital.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed adult patients with Crohn's disease who had \nintra-abdominal fistulas and were followed for three years. Baseline data were \ncollected from medical records, and imaging studies assessed the fistula type, \nnumber, affected segment length, and presence of strictures and abscesses. \nMultivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for \nsurgical intervention.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors that led to early surgical intervention in \npatients with intra-abdominal fistulizing Crohn's disease.\nSAMPLE SIZE: 73 patients.\nRESULTS: Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria: 27 (37.0%) in the \nnonsurgical group and 46 (63.0%) in the surgical group. Early surgical \nintervention was done if patients had bloating or constipation (P=.018), \nextensive disease segments (P<.001), and no prior biologic treatment (0.015). In \nthe multivariate analysis, early surgical intervention was indicated for \nenterocutaneous fistulas (odds ratio [OR]: 8.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: \n1.25-53.80, P=.03), abscesses (OR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.03-26.12, P=.046), and \nstrictures (OR: 6.08, 95% CI: 1.26-29.25, P=.024). Nonsurgical fistula treatment \nresulted in complications in 55% of patients, 48% of them requiring surgical \nresections, whereas biologic treatment achieved a 40.7% fistula healing rate.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings associated with Crohn's fistulas, including \nenterocutaneous fistulas, extensive disease segments, strictures, and abscesses, \nare associated with a higher likelihood of early surgical intervention and may \nsuggest potential ineffectiveness of biologic therapies.\nLIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective analysis of a single center with a small \nsample size, which may involve a degree of recall bias when data are collected, \nthus reducing the reliability of the results."}

Due to limited pediatric data, reference ranges and management are \noften extrapolated from adult studies. We review four pediatric \nneurogastroenterology areas where clinical science may translate and inform \nadult gastroenterology. Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency can be diagnosed via \ndisaccharidase enzyme testing from duodenal mucosal biopsies. Dietary \nrestriction and sacrosidase supplementation are effective, based on randomized \ncontrolled trials, in children with genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency; \nhowever, they remain to be rigorously studied in adults. Gastric emptying breath \ntesting (GEBT) in large cohorts of children reinforces the importance of \nbiological sex, puberty, and size while deriving normative reference values. \nFurther study of GEBT in adults may help determine the influence of sex and \nhormones on gastric emptying rates, offering an opportunity to develop tailored \nreference ranges. Antegrade continence enema (ACE) therapy is the most common \nreversible surgical treatment for children with chronic constipation with high \nrates of efficacy. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of ACE in adult \npopulations. Auricular neurostimulation through percutaneous electrical nerve \nfield stimulation is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in \nadolescents with irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia based on \nsham-controlled, randomized trials with emerging efficacy data in other \npediatric DGBI. To date, efficacy studies using auricular neurostimulation in \nadults with gastrointestinal disorders have not been performed. These areas \nhighlight how pediatric neurogastroenterology generates discoveries with the \npotential to guide approaches in adult populations, underscoring the \nbidirectional value of translational clinical science."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "constipation", "text": "Gut dysmotility is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by \ndisrupted defecation and often accompanied by depression and anxiety. Lycopene \n(LYC) is a type of carotenoid with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory \nproperties. However, the effects of LYC on gut dysmotility and related \nbehavioral disorders remain elusive. Herein, we found that 100 mg kg-1 d-1 LYC \nnotably improved the gut transit time and intestinal transit rate as well as \nconcurrently alleviated depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a \ndiphenoxylate (Dip, 5 mg kg-1 d-1)-induced constipated mouse model. LYC \npretreatment enhanced gut barrier integrity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) \nproduction as well as rebalanced gut microbiota homeostasis by enriching \nbeneficial bacteria, including Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia. Furthermore, LYC \nrestored enteric neuronal function, as evidenced by increased HuC/D and Tuj1 \nexpression as well as balanced neurotransmitter levels. Brain transcriptomics \nresults suggest that LYC regulates the cholinergic synapse pathway and increases \nacetylcholine (Ach) content in the brain, which is associated with the \nalleviation of neuroinflammation. In summary, this study offers insights into \nfunctional dietary component-based nutritional strategies that target gut \ndysmotility comorbid behavioral dysfunction."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "constipation", "text": "Internal hernias are a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, accounting for a \nsmall proportion of cases. Among these, paraduodenal hernias represent a \nsignificant subtype and require prompt recognition and intervention to prevent \nlife-threatening complications. We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no \nsignificant medical or surgical history who presented with a three-day history \nof generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Clinical examination \nrevealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds. \nLaboratory findings were unremarkable except for leukocytosis. Abdominal X-ray \ndemonstrated features of small bowel obstruction, and CT imaging identified \nfindings suggestive of a left paraduodenal hernia. Exploratory laparotomy \nrevealed a large encapsulated peritoneal sac originating from the left \nparaduodenal region and extending into the pelvis. Dilated and edematous but \nviable small bowel loops were released, and adhesiolysis was performed. A \nplanned second-look surgery two days later confirmed resolution of bowel edema, \nand the abdomen was closed without complications. Paraduodenal hernias arise \nfrom a congenital anomaly involving the mesentery and often present as \nintermittent or acute bowel obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging due to \nnonspecific symptoms but can be facilitated by CT imaging. Definitive management \ninvolves surgical reduction and repair of the hernia, whether through open or \nlaparoscopic approaches. This case highlights the importance of considering \ninternal hernias in young patients with small bowel obstruction and no prior \nabdominal surgery. Prompt imaging, timely surgery, and individualized management \nare crucial for optimal outcomes."}

Previously, the patient underwent laparoscopic insertion of PD \ncatheter due to ESKD. One month after the procedure, there were signs of \ncatheter obstruction. Laparoscopy evaluation and revision were carried out.\nCONCLUSION: PD catheter malfunction is primarily due to obstruction; early \nlaparoscopic intervention should be considered to address adhesion to other \norgans, preventing complications and PD discontinuation."}

The principal objective of this study was to describe the oral \nphenotype of young children with SATB2-associated syndrome, especially in terms \nof orofacial malformation of Robin Sequence (RS) spectrum (bifid uvula, cleft \npalate, or\u00a0RS, dental malformation, feeding and communication, with data from a \nnational cohort. The secondary objective was to determine whether feeding and \ncommunication disorders were more severe when associated with an orofacial \nmalformation of RS spectrum.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study among the largest \npossible cohort of patients with a mutation of the SATB2 gene in France. A \nquestionnaire completed by the referring physicians and by telephone with \nparents enabled us to collect the following clinical information: (1) orofacial \nmorphology, feeding difficulties, and pharyngeal functioning from birth to \n3\u00a0years, (2) communication and language from 0 to 6\u00a0years, (3) speech \ndevelopment at the last examination.\nRESULTS: The study included 40 patients. Early and persistent feeding \ndifficulties were found in 55% of the children. Communication was abnormal from \nthe first months of life, with poor babbling in 85% of them. A major language \ndelay was described in all patients; 65% had a vocabulary of 10 words or less. \nAn anomaly of RS spectrum was found in half the cases, and dental malformations \nwere described in 90%. Feeding difficulties and language delay were greater in \nthe group with one or more orofacial malformations than the group with none.\nCONCLUSION: This study confirmed the severity of oral involvement, affecting \nfeeding and speech simultaneously, in individuals with SAS. It raises the \nquestion of why the oral phenotype involving feeding and speech is more severe \nin the presence of cleft palate or RS. We recommend close monitoring of \nprelanguage communication in infants with apparently isolated cleft palate or RS \nand the search for SATB2 impairment when a cleft palate or RS is found, \nespecially in the prenatal period."}

Previous studies on oral dysfunction \nhave focused on older people already in need of nursing care. Therefore, we \nconducted a study of older people able to travel independently or with minor \nassistance to examine the relationship between oral and cognitive function in \nmemory clinic study participants classified as cognitively normal, with mild \ncognitive impairment, or with dementia.\nMETHODS: Participants were 178 study participants (median age: 79.0\u00a0years, 49.4% \nfemale) attending the memory clinic at the National Center for Geriatrics and \nGerontology, Japan. Following provision of informed consent, cognitive function \nwas assessed using clinical dementia ratings and oral function assessed using \nnumber of present teeth, occlusal force, oral diadochokinesis, repetitive \nsalivary swallowing test, and tongue pressure. The relationships between \ncognitive and oral function were evaluated using multivariable logistic \nregression analyses.\nRESULTS: Of the participants, 25, 92, and 61 were classified as cognitively \nnormal, with mild cognitive impairment, and with dementia, respectively. Oral \ndiadochokinesis /ka/ was associated with a high risk of mild cognitive \nimpairment: adjusted odds ratio, 6.930 (95% confidence interval: 1.284-37.402, \nP\u2009=\u20090.024).

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "dry eyes", "text": "Tear secretion from the lacrimal gland is essential for maintaining ocular \nsurface homeostasis, and its insufficiency causes aqueous-deficient dry eye. \nUnlike the well-established parasympathetic neuronal regulation, the role of \nsympathetic nervous system (SNS) in tear secretion remains controversial. Here, \nwe demonstrate the intact sympathetic innervation in lacrimal gland and its \nactivation under multiple dry eye stresses. Pharmacological, surgical, and \ngenetic blockade of SNS increases tear secretion and alleviates dry eye signs. \nMechanistically, SNS-driven noradrenaline (NA) release activates \u03b11a-adrenergic \nreceptor (Adra1a) in acinar and myoepithelial cells to regulate mitochondrial \nUcp2 and tear secretion. Systemic and local delivery of Adra1a antagonists, \nincluding silodosin and tamsulosin, improves tear secretion and reduces corneal \nlesions in multiple dry eye mouse models. In addition, we identify the brain \nlocus coeruleus as an upstream driver orchestrating sympathetic regulation of \nlacrimal secretion. Overall, these findings reveal a gatekeeper role of SNS in \ntear secretion and offer potential therapeutic strategies for dry eye disease."}

The inspection \nencompasses essential variables which include Schirmer's Test 1 (ST1), Tear Film \nBreakup Time (TBUT), ocular surface staining (OSS), tear osmolarity, blink rate, \nalongside symptom severity measured by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI).\nMETHODS: Fifty participants (100 eyes; 33 males, 17 females), aged 18-25\u00a0years, \nwere evaluated during morning and nocturnal phases following 5\u00a0h of VDT \nexposure. The purpose inspections comprised ST1, TBUT, OSS, tear osmolarity, \nalongside blink rate. The previously Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) has \nbeen utilised for assessing unreliable warning signs. The statistical \nevaluations have been performed by employing paired t-tests, Pearson \ncorrelation, alongside straight-line regression mathematical modelling.\nRESULTS: ST1 values decreased significantly at night (right eye: \n18.06\u2009\u00b1\u20092.49\u00a0mm; left eye: 19.02\u2009\u00b1\u20092.48\u00a0mm) compared to morning (right eye: \n22.18\u2009\u00b1\u20091.95\u00a0mm; left eye: 23.70\u2009\u00b1\u20091.94\u00a0mm) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). TBUT declined from \n7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 to 4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0s, accompanied by a 44% reduction in blink rate. OSDI \nscores rose from 25.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2 to 42.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9, correlating negatively with TBUT \n(r\u2009=\u2009-0.69, p\u2009<\u20090.01).

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "dry eyes", "text": "PURPOSE: Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-related dry eye disease (SS-DED) is an autoimmune \ndisorder characterized by ocular surface inflammation and lacrimal gland \ndysfunction, with limited clinical treatment options currently available.\nMETHODS: Based on the traditional Chinese medicine theory of \"the liver opens \ninto the eyes\" and the modern \"gut-eye axis\" hypothesis. This study investigated \nthe therapeutic effects and immunomodulatory mechanisms of total glucosides of \npaeony (TGP) using a NOD mouse model.\nRESULTS: The results showed that TGP significantly increased tear secretion in \nSS mice, alleviated corneal and conjunctival damage, improved pathological \nchanges in the Harderian gland, reduced inflammatory infiltration, and restored \nglandular secretory function. At the molecular level, TGP markedly downregulated \npro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 while upregulating \nanti-inflammatory factors like IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, effectively modulating the \nTh17/Treg immune balance. Additionally, TGP enhanced the expression of tight \njunction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-3) in SS mice, repairing \nintestinal barrier function. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that TGP \nintervention regulated gut microbiota composition in SS mice, reducing the \nFirmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increasing the abundance of beneficial \nbacteria such as Lactobacillus. Functional prediction analysis indicated that \nTGP-modulated gut microbiota primarily participated in key metabolic pathways, \nincluding carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, TGP can ameliorate ocular surface damage in SS mice \nby regulating gut microecology and immune homeostasis via the \"gut-eye axis\" \npathway. Our study not only provides a novel therapeutic strategy for SS-DED but \nalso offers scientific evidence for the modernization of traditional Chinese \nmedicine theories."}

Tear secretion, corneal epithelial barrier function, \nexpressions of matrix-metalloproteinases, chemokines, and inflammatory cytokines \nwere assessed. Transcriptomic analysis identified key pathways, followed by \nexperimental validation with human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs).\nRESULTS: DED mice showed apparent SNS activation with elevated corneal NE \ncontents. Systemic SNS ablation and local NE depletion alleviated dry eye \nseverity. Topical NE administration induced dry eye signs in healthy mice, but \nnot in Adrb2-/- mice. ICI 118,551 improved tear secretion, corneal epithelial \nbarrier function, and reduced inflammation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed \nthat the top 10 downregulated pathways were strongly associated with dry \neye-related inflammatory responses, including TNF, NF-\u03baB, chemokines, and IL-17 \nsignaling pathways. In vitro, ICI 118,551 inhibited NF-\u03baB activation and \ninflammatory cytokines expression in HCECs under hyperosmotic stress.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides direct evidence that SNS activation drives dry \neye onset through the NE-\u03b22-AR signaling pathway, offering a potential \ntherapeutic target for dry eye diseases."}

Also, NEMG in multiple extensors had a \nsignificant increase (with the largest increase of 114% in lLES in LL, \np\u2009=\u20090.023).\nCONCLUSION: During sustained asymmetry spinal loading, the NEMG in bilateral HAM \nhas significant increase and the NEMG in bilateral erect spinea has a decrease \ntendency. After loading, the NEMG has a significant increase, in parallel with \nspasms elicited in multiple extensors in relation period in flexion-extension \nperformance, with no significant difference between bilateral sides. It may \nindicate that sustained asymmetry spinal loading could lead to a weakness for \ntension ability, and/or a micro-damage in spinal bilateral passive tissues in \nlow back area, the risk of developing low back disorder."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "muscle cramps", "text": "Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) is relatively common among patients with \nhemifacial spasm (HFS). Vertebral artery (VA)-associated HFS accounts for 10-30% \nof cases. In microvascular decompression (MVD) for these patients, mobilization \nof the VA and other offending vessels is challenging, often limiting exposure of \nthe root exit zone (REZ). Glue-transposition has emerged as the primary \ntechnique to address this issue. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes and \ncomplications associated with glue-transposition through a cohort study and a \ncomprehensive literature review. A retrospective analysis of 164 patients who \nunderwent MVD at Shenzhen Second People's Hospital was conducted, categorizing \nthem into VBD (14 patients) and non-VBD (150 patients) groups. Additionally, a \nsystematic literature search was performed in PubMed up to June 2024, including \nclinical studies that applied the glue-transposition technique in MVD. The \nremission rate, complications, and surgical techniques were analyzed in detail. \nIn our cohort, patients in the VBD group had a higher mean age and a higher \nprevalence of hypertension. Glue-transposition was required in 64.3% of VBD \ncases. Logistic regression analysis identified hypertension as significantly \nassociated with VBD. The spasm remission rates and complication rates were \ncomparable between VBD and non-VBD groups. The systematic review included 14 \nstudies, of which 10 employed the one-step transposition technique, while four \nutilized the two-step approach. The included studies reported favorable outcomes \n(Cohen grade I or II) with the glue-transposition technique, ranging from 84.9 \nto 100%. The complication rates varied from 0 to 9.5%. Hypertension is an \nindependent risk factor for VBD, which significantly increases the surgical \ncomplexity in MVD. Glue-transposition remains the most widely used technique for \nVA-associated HFS, with fibrin being the most common adhesive. We present the \nfirst experience of using cyanoacrylate as an adhesive in our cohort. Both our \ncohort study and literature review demonstrate that the glue-transposition \ntechnique is safe and effective."}

Although preventive measures are critical, operators must \nrecognize the complication and the various methods to safely resolve it.\nCASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old man presented with progressive angina. A coronary \nangiogram via the right radial artery revealed a heavily calcified, subtotally \noccluded right coronary artery. Attempts to engage the right coronary artery \nresulted in an overtorqued, kinked guide catheter within the brachial artery. \nInitial resolution measures were unsuccessful. A novel alternative method-the \nsimultaneous antegrade/retrograde double-balloon-handshake-inflation (SARDHI) \ntechnique-successfully resolved the kink. The SARDHI method involved obtaining \nalternative access, passing a guidewire distal to the kink, inflating 2 \nhigh-pressure coronary balloons on either side of the kink, and unraveling the \nkink in the larger-caliber axillary artery.\nDISCUSSION: Catheter kinking management should be individualized to the \npatient's anatomy and risk factors. We present the first report of the SARDHI \ntechnique for safe kinked catheter extraction during coronary intervention.\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGES: This case highlights the risk factors and early signs of a \nkinked transradial coronary guide catheter and frames the stepwise approach for \nits resolution. Techniques for preventing guide catheter kinking include \nresolving vessel spasm, avoiding catheter over-rotation, ensuring adequate guide \nsupport, and ensuring the guidewire remains in situ within the guide while \ntorquing. The simultaneous antegrade/retrograde \ndouble-balloon-handshake-inflation (SARDHI) technique should be considered by \nproceduralists as a novel, viable method for percutaneous kinked catheter \nextraction given its technical ease, independence from a larger-bore catheter, \nand avoidance of distal catheter tip deformation."}

Meanwhile, a multivariate \nmeta-analysis identified independent risk factors.\nRESULTS: Fifteen observational studies comprising 5,262 MVD cases and 494 DFP \nevents met inclusion criteria. The pooled incidence of DFP was 9% (95% CI: \n7-10). The average duration of DFP was 84.8 days (95% CI: 23.4-146.2), and the \nmean latency from surgery to onset was 10.9 days (95% CI: 4.7-17.1). \nMultivariate meta-analysis of nine studies using adjusted data identified facial \nnerve indentation (OR = 12.78, 95% CI: 3.66-41.74), multiple offending vessels \n(OR = 6.95, 95% CI: 1.41-34.22), and longer disease duration (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: \n1.01-2.89) as significant risk factors for DFP (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: DFP is a relatively common complication after MVD, and facial nerve \nindentation, prolonged disease duration, and the presence of multiple offending \nvessels significantly increase DFP risk."}

Episodes of INOCA can be caused by \ndifferent mechanisms including coronary microvascular dysfunction and coronary \nartery spasm, while episodes of MINOCA can be caused by plaque disruption \n(rupture or erosion), coronary artery spasm, or coronary embolism. Both \nconditions affect women more than men.\nREVIEW METHODS: The current review evaluates available evidence on exercise and \ncardiac rehabilitation in patients with INOCA and MINOCA.\nSUMMARY: Small studies have shown that exercise training can result in \nimprovements in endothelial function, myocardial perfusion, exercise capacity, \nand overall wellbeing and quality of life in patients with INOCA. Structured \ncardiac rehabilitation programs have also been shown to improve symptoms of \nangina, physical functioning, and quality of life for patients with INOCA. \nStudies of cardiac rehabilitation among patients with MINOCA have found that \nonly one third participate in cardiac rehabilitation, but among those who do, \nobservational studies and a randomized controlled trial demonstrate a lower risk \nof major adverse cardiovascular events (such as all-cause mortality and nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction) with cardiac rehabilitation. However, given that INOCA \nand MINOCA are conditions that predominantly affect women and may be caused by \nnon-atherosclerotic mechanisms, tailoring of traditional cardiac rehabilitation \nprograms (eg, education components) may be desirable to meet the specific needs \nof these patients. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of tailored \ncardiac rehabilitation programs with novel delivery methods to optimize programs \nfor patients with INOCA and MINOCA."}

Minor complications included chest wall pain \n(n = 6), chest tube air leak (n = 4), dyspnea (n = 3), atelectasis (n = 2), \nileus (n = 2), postpneumonectomy syndrome (n = 1), and chronic cough (n = 1). \nSerious complications included atrial fibrillation (n = 2), respiratory failure \n(n = 1), hemothorax (n = 1), hypovolemic shock (n = 1), and intraoperative \ntension pneumothorax (n = 1). No patients died during surgery or secondary to \nany complications of surgery.\nOUTCOMES: The cumulative 2-year survival rate was 98.5%, and the cumulative \n5-year survival rate was 96.3%. There were seven total deaths during the study \nperiod, but the cause of death was not reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that resection of primary pulmonary carcinoid \ntumors is relatively low risk, with excellent long-term survival rates."}

Specific \nstimuli, as water immersion or mechanical pressure usually elicit it. This study \nexplored the influence of some physical, chemical, sympathetic stimuli and \ncircadian cycle on SSW.\nMETHODS: Time required to achieve grade III finger wrinkling was assessed in 24 \nhealthy adults. SSW induced by room-temperature filtered water (RTFW) for \ncomparison across temperature variations: warm water (40\u00b0C) and iced water; \ntonicity: Distilled water and hypertonic saline (36% NaCl); pH variations: \nacidic and alkaline solution; oily medium: soybean oil; or pressure: immersion \nunder hydrostatic pressure (30cm water column). To evaluate the influence of \nsympathetic activity, SSW was assessed under caffeine stimulation: 30min after \ningestion of 60mg caffeine (Ristretto espresso); diurnal variation: testing at \n10AM versus 10PM; or ischemic influence: under sub-systolic ischemia induced by \nan arm cuff. Additionally, 12 participants underwent 10min fingertip exposures \nto EMLA and room-temperature vinegar for comparison.\nRESULTS: The time to reach grade III SSW under RTFW varied widely across the \nsample (from 2.1 to 37.0min). The acidic solution reduced the time to SSW \ncompared to RTFW (mean: 6.4 vs 13.9min; p<0.01), with a more pronounced effect \nobserved with a warm (40\u00b0C) acidic solution (4.0 vs 15.5min; p<0.01). Hot water, \ndistilled water, and 30cm hydrostatic pressure stimulation shortened the time to \nSSW compared to RTFW (p<0.01). No SSW was observed after 30min of immersion in \nthe oily medium, iced water, alkaline solution, hypertonic solution, or \nfollowing ischemia. A circadian influence on SSW was also observed, with morning \nmeasurements resulting in a faster response than at night (10.4 vs 14.6min; \np<0.01). SSW was also accelerated after coffee consumption (6.1 vs 10.5min; \np<0.01). After 10min of stimulation with either EMLA or vinegar, 75% of \nparticipants reached grade III SSW (p=1.00).\nCONCLUSION: SSW is influenced by multiple factors, including solution \ntemperature, pH, osmolarity, hydrostatic pressure, caffeine ingestion, and \ncircadian timing. Warm vinegar elicited a faster and more consistent SSW \nresponse compared to other tested conditions, highlighting its use in \nexperimental settings. No difference in SSW was observed between \nroom-temperature vinegar and EMLA after 10min, supporting its potential for \nclinical application."}

Here, we present a \ncomprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in females from the UK \nBiobank.\nMETHODS: 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included. \nDetailed MHT prescription data from primary care records was available for 538. \nWe tested for associations between the brain measures (i.e. gray/white matter \nbrain age, hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes) and MHT \nuser status, age at first and last use, duration of use, formulation, route of \nadministration, dosage, type, and active ingredient. We further tested for the \neffects of a history of hysterectomy \u00b1 bilateral oophorectomy among MHT users \nand examined associations by APOE \u03b54 status.\nRESULTS: Current MHT users, not past users, showed older gray and white matter \nbrain age, with a difference of up to 9 mo, and smaller hippocampal volumes \ncompared to never-users. Longer duration of use and older age at last use \npost-menopause was associated with older gray and white matter brain age, larger \nwhite matter hyperintensity volume, and smaller hippocampal volumes. MHT users \nwith a history of hysterectomy \u00b1 bilateral oophorectomy showed younger gray \nmatter brain age relative to MHT users without such history. We found no \nassociations by APOE \u03b54 status and with other MHT variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT \nuse and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past \nsurgical history.\nFUNDING: The authors received funding from the Research Council of Norway (LTW: \n223273, 249795, 273345, 298646, 300768), the South-Eastern Norway Regional \nHealth Authority (CB: 2023037, 2022103; LTW: 2018076, 2019101), the European \nResearch Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation \nprogram (LTW: 802998), the Swiss National Science Foundation (AMGdL: \nPZ00P3_193658), the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (LAMG: PJT-173554), \nthe Treliving Family Chair in Women's Mental Health at the Centre for Addiction \nand Mental Health (LAMG), womenmind at the Centre for Addiction and Mental \nHealth (LAMG, BHL), the Ann S.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "night sweats", "text": "Plain Language Summary: Ovarian hormones, including oestrogens and progesterone, \nfluctuate throughout each menstrual cycle, during and after pregnancy, and in \nthe years leading up to menopause when ovarian function begins to decline. \nDuring these transitional years, up to 80% of women will experience symptoms \nsuch as hot flashes and night sweats, which are believed to stem from the brain. \nMenopausal hormone therapy (MHT) often contains low doses of estrogens with or \nwithout progesterone and is commonly prescribed to minimize menopausal symptoms. \nMHT is believed to protect the brain and reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease; \nhowever, the evidence supporting this claim is conflicting. Furthermore, \nadditional research is necessary to evaluate the risks and benefits of MHT on \nbrain health. It remains unclear whether other factors, including a genetic \npredisposition to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the age at which MHT begins, the \nformulation, and the route of administration (e.g., pills or a transdermal \npatch), affect the impact of MHT on the brain. Addressing these questions is \ncrucial to inform clinical decision-making regarding the prescription of MHT and \nto subsequently enhance women\u2019s brain health during and beyond the menopause \ntransition. Barth et al. analyzed brain imaging data as well as data about \nlifestyle and demographic factors and histories of gynecological surgeries, of \nover 20,000 current, past, and never users of MHT from the UK Biobank cohort. As \na proxy for brain health, they calculated the so-called \u2018brain age gap\u2019, which \nrefers to the difference between a person\u2019s actual chronological age and their \nestimated brain age calculated from brain imaging data using machine learning; \ne.g., if someone\u2019s chronological age is 50 years and their predicted brain age \nis 45, the brain age gap is \u20135 years. A negative brain age gap indicates a \n'younger-looking' brain, while a positive brain age gap suggests a brain that \nappears 'older'. Barth et al. further looked at the volume of the hippocampus, a \nbrain region important for memory, learning and emotion regulation. They found \nthat women who were current MHT users had an \u2018older looking brain\u2019 than women \nwho had never taken MHT. The volume of the hippocampus was also smaller. In past \nusers, the age at which MHT was last taken also made a difference. Those who \nwere older at the time of their last use after menopause had an \u201colder looking\u201d \nbrain and lower hippocampal volumes. Similar results were found for women who \ntook MHT for longer. However, women on MHT who had undergone surgery to remove \ntheir womb and/or both ovaries had a \u2018younger looking brain\u2019 than women on MHT \nwithout similar surgical histories. Interestingly, factors such as a genetic \nrisk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, differences in formulations, or methods of \nadministration did not appear to affect brain health in this study. The findings \nof Barth et al. suggest that MHT does not have a general neuroprotective effect, \nnor does it lead to severe adverse effects on brain health. Instead, the impact \nof MHT on the brain may be influenced by various factors, including age, \nduration of use, and past surgical history. However, since the study is \ncross-sectional, meaning it was conducted at a single point in time, direct \ncausality cannot be established. Future research examining the long-term impact \nof MHT on brain health is crucial for understanding individual risk profiles and \nbenefits. Women around the world are faced with critical decisions regarding MHT \nuse, yet the current lack of comprehensive research leaves them without the \nnecessary evidence to make informed choices."}

It highlights a rare clinical \nscenario in which viral immune dysregulation likely facilitated TB progression. \nTo date, few reports have explored the complex interplay between COVID-19, EBV \nreactivation, and TB in a single patient, particularly with isolated \nextrapulmonary involvement. Case Presentation: A 24-year-old woman presented \nwith persistent low-grade fever, fatigue, night sweats, unintentional weight \nloss, and progressive cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. These \nsymptoms emerged shortly after a moderate COVID-19 infection. Laboratory studies \nrevealed elevated inflammatory markers and pronounced lymphopenia. EBV \nreactivation was confirmed via serology and PCR. Despite antiviral therapy, \nsymptoms persisted, and imaging revealed necrotic lymphadenopathy. Tuberculous \nlymphadenitis was diagnosed through fine-needle aspiration cytology and PCR \ndetection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was treated with a standard \nanti-tuberculosis regimen, resulting in clinical, radiological, and \nimmunological improvement. Conclusions: This case underscores the importance of \nconsidering latent TB reactivation in patients with persistent lymphadenopathy \nand recent viral infections, particularly in regions with high TB prevalence. It \nalso emphasizes the need for thorough immunological and microbiological \nassessment in complex post-viral syndromes. The main clinical takeaway is that \nCOVID-19 and EBV co-infection may create a permissive environment for TB \nreactivation through immune system compromise."}

To address this gap, we investigated the \nassociations of daytime nap timing and intraindividual variability of nap \nduration with incident Alzheimer's dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from 936 older adults (age range: 56-99; 77% female) \nin the Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine incident Alzheimer's dementia \nand from 320 deceased participants (age range at death: 71-105; 70% female) to \nexamine Alzheimer's pathology. The proportions of morning (9-11am) and early \nafternoon naps (1-3\u2009pm) and the intraindividual variability of nap duration were \nassessed using actigraphy. Participants completed neurological assessments at \nbaseline and annually for up to 17 years. In deceased participants, amyloid \u03b2 \nand neurofibrillary tangles were examined.\nRESULTS: Here we show that more morning naps are linked to a higher risk of \nAlzheimer's dementia, whereas more early afternoon naps are linked to reduced \namyloid \u03b2 levels. Higher intraindividual variability of nap duration is shown to \nbe associated with increased amyloid \u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that specific timing patterns and \nirregularities in daytime napping are linked to Alzheimer's disease risk and \npathology. Multi-dimensional assessments of nap behaviors may aid in risk \nstratification for neurocognitive impairment and offer a potential target for \ninterventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging."}

We found that more frequent morning naps were \nlinked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Additionally, more \nnaps in the early afternoon and more consistent nap patterns were linked to \nlower levels of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology.

However, the underlying \nmechanisms by which general anaesthetics contribute to PND remain largely \nunknown. Based on our findings of a link between hyperhomocysteinaemia and \nincreased risk of PND, we investigated functional alterations in \ncystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS) and its role in memory function after general \nanaesthesia.\nMETHODS: Mice were subjected to isoflurane 1.4 vol% anaesthesia for 2 h, and the \nlevels of homocysteine, homocysteine-associated enzyme expression, and CBS \nactivity were measured using ELISA. The time course of memory reconstruction \nafter general anaesthesia was evaluated using the contextual fear conditioning \ntest. WaterLOGSY was used to examine the interaction between isoflurane and CBS. \nA hydrogen sulfide (H2S) probe, AZ-NO2, was used for H2S bioimaging, and RNA \nsequencing, sulfhydrome detection, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings \nwere performed to explore the underlying mechanisms.\nRESULTS: The decline in cognitive function persisted for at least 8 h after \nisoflurane anaesthesia, which is attributed to the selective homocysteine \naccumulation in the brain via direct inhibition of CBS activity by isoflurane. \nActivation of CBS alleviates the reduction of H2S and alters the sulfhydration \nof synaptic-related proteins, ultimately accelerating the restoration of \nneuronal firing rates in the hippocampus (saline, 1.42 [0.49] vs NaHS, 2.45 \n[0.68] Hz). Pretreatment with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, CBS activator) could \nincrease the freezing time of mice after isoflurane anaesthesia (control 4.86 \n[3.30]% vs SAM, 9.89 [3.03]%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane contributes to delayed cognitive recovery after \nisoflurane anaesthesia in mice by directly inhibiting CBS activity, providing \nnovel insights into the involvement of isoflurane in PNDs and their underlying \nmechanisms."}

However, the potential mechanism remains \nunclear. Neuroimaging studies have found that tPBM-induced physiological changes \nexist in both targeted and non-targeted brain areas, suggesting the necessity of \nunderstanding the modulation mechanism from the perspective of the whole brain \nlevel.\nOBJECTIVE: This randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled crossover study aimed \nto investigate the hypothesis that tPBM improved working memory in healthy older \nadults through the mechanism of optimizing the properties of the resting-state \nfunctional brain networks.\nMETHODS: A total of 55 right-handed healthy older adults were randomly assigned \nto sham tPBM session group or active tPBM session group. After a washout \ninterval, they were assigned to the opposite intervention session. Each session \nincluded the following: active or sham tPBM application with a 1064-nm laser to \nthe left forehead; before and after, resting-state functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements; and the digital n-back task. Differences in \naccuracy and reaction time of the n-back task, and changes in functional \nconnectivity and graph metrics of the brain networks were investigated and \ncompared between the active and sham tPBM sessions. In addition, correlations \nbetween tPBM-induced changes in functional brain networks, and the n-back task \nwere examined.\nRESULTS: The results showed that compared with the sham tPBM session, the \naccuracy and reaction time during 3-back task significantly improved in the \nactive tPBM session. In addition, the global efficiency, local efficiency, nodal \nefficiency, and functional connectivity significantly increased in the active \ntPBM session, particularly in the frontoparietal areas. Importantly, the altered \n3-back accuracy was positively correlated with the changes of functional \nconnectivity and nodal efficiency mainly in left prefrontal cortex in those who \nhad increased 3-back accuracy in the active tPBM session.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that tPBM may serve as an effective tool to \nimprove working memory in older adults through the modulation of resting-state \nfunctional brain network properties. Investigations in large-scale samples are \nneeded to further validate the findings of this study."}

Histopathological \nassessments showed enhanced structural integrity in hippocampal regions. FTIR \nspectroscopy revealed agomelatine's protective effect on brain molecular \nstructure, mainly through preserving lipid order in the CH stretching region and \npreventing protein oxidation in the C\u2009=\u2009O spectral range, both of which are \ntypically altered by AD pathology. These results emphasize the efficacy of \nagomelatine and support its consideration in mitigating symptoms associated with \nAD etiology."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "memory loss", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by \ncognitive decline and memory loss, with limited therapeutic options. Traditional \ntreatments primarily focus on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), which \naim to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain, and selective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which modulate serotonin levels. However, these \ntreatments often provide only modest symptom relief. This review explores the \npotential benefits of combined targeting of cholinesterases and serotonin \nreuptake as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. We discuss the \npathophysiological role of acetylcholine and serotonin in AD, highlighting their \nimpact on cognitive function, mood regulation, and neuroplasticity. By targeting \nboth cholinergic and serotonergic systems, this dual approach may offer \nsynergistic effects, improving cognitive function, reducing neuropsychiatric \nsymptoms, and enhancing neuroprotective mechanisms. The review also examines \npreclinical and clinical studies investigating the efficacy of combination \ntherapies and outlines the challenges and opportunities in their development. \nUltimately, this combined targeting approach holds promise for providing more \neffective and comprehensive treatment options for AD, addressing both cognitive \nand behavioural symptoms associated with the disease."}

Upregulation of NEK2 is associated with aberrant B cell \nproliferation, a phenomenon potentially driven by NEK2-mediated disruption of \nthe PKM1/PKM2 equilibrium. The overexpression of NEK2 in the B cell lineage may \nfacilitate the maturation processes of B cells. Nonetheless, the precise role of \nNEK2 in modulating B cell-mediated immunity in autoimmune disorders remains to \nbe fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that NEK2 was significantly \nupregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Pharmacological inhibition of \nNEK2 resulted in a marked reduction in the expression of co-stimulatory \nmolecules CD80 and CD86 on B cells, concomitant with a suppression of their \nproliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and \nclass-switched memory B cells (SWM). Administration of the NEK2 inhibitor INH1 \nin a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) led to \nnotable improvements in neurological function, amelioration of demyelination, \nand a decrease in the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the central nervous \nsystem (CNS) compared to vehicle-treated EAE mice. Mass cytometry analysis \nrevealed that NEK2 inhibition downregulated the expression of co-stimulatory \nmolecules and diminished the proportion of Th1 cells in the CD4\u2009+\u2009T cell \npopulation. In vitro studies further substantiated that NEK2 blockade attenuated \nCD4\u2009+\u2009T cell proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells by disrupting B-T \ncell interactions. Collectively, these findings underscore an immunomodulatory \nfunction for NEK2 and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in the \ntreatment of multiple sclerosis."}

Metabolic \nreprogramming from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis has been associated with \nkidney injury. Given the histological localisation of T cell-mediated rejection \n(TCMR) to the tubulointerstitium, we hypothesised that expression of glycolytic \ncontrol proteins contained in urinary extracellular vesicles (UEV) may increase \nduring TCMR.\nMETHODS: In this prospective observational study, urine samples were collected \nfrom kidney transplant recipients prior to indication biopsy. UEV were separated \nby differential ultracentrifugation. Vesicle markers, glycolytic control \nproteins and CD3 were assayed by immunoblotting. Differences in protein \ndetection were compared across biopsy diagnoses (TCMR versus not) and Banff \nlesion scores.\nRESULTS: 51 paired urine and biopsy samples from 43 subjects were included. The \nTCMR group comprised of 6 cases of TCMR and 1 borderline TCMR. The remaining 44 \nsamples comprised a \"No TCMR\" group. There was significant increase in \nphosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) (p\u2009=\u20090.018) in \nTCMR compared to No TCMR, and similarly when tubulitis (p\u2009=\u20090.037) and \ninterstitial inflammation (p\u2009=\u20090.047) were present. Total inflammation score \u2265 1 \nwas associated with increases in PFKFB2 (p\u2009=\u20090.027), PFKFB3 (p\u2009=\u20090.090) and \nPFKFB4 (p\u2009=\u20090.0098). Interstitial fibrosis was associated with increased PFKFB2 \n(p\u2009=\u20090.0045) and PFKFB3 (p\u2009=\u20090.045). CD3\u2009+\u2009UEV did not correlate with TCMR \ndiagnosis. When combining the four glycolytic control proteins governing the \nphosphofructokinase-1 step of glycolysis (PFK-L, PFKFB2, PFKFB3 and PFKFB4), \npresence of\u2009\u2265\u20093 markers discriminated TCMR with ROC AUC of 0.73 (95% CI \n0.50-0.96).\nCONCLUSION: Increased rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis in UEV were detected \nin association with tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. This suggests \naltered energy metabolism in the form of increased renal glycolysis occurring in \nthe tubular epithelium, consistent with findings in native kidney injury. \nFurther work is required to evaluate whether this could serve as a non-invasive \nstrategy to study pathology in kidney transplantation."}

In \nthis study, definitive drug testing is used to assess ED drug prevalence and \nimmunoassay drug screening performance.\nMETHODS: Definitive testing for 116 drugs and metabolites was performed on urine \nfrom 400 ED patients, with comparison to immunoassay drug screening.\nRESULTS: Definitive testing resulted in 1,350 drug findings with prevalent use \nof nicotine (63%), cocaine (34%), \u22069 tetrahydrocannabinol (34%), fentanyl (17%), \nmorphine or heroin (11%) and methamphetamine (6%). Forty percent of patients \nwere also positive for antidepressants and 24% positive for antipsychotics. \nSignificant patterns of co-drug use were found for cocaine, fentanyl, morphine \nand nicotine. Multi-serotonergic drug use was frequent, suggesting a risk for \nserotonin syndrome. Immunoassay performance showed high false negative rates for \nbenzodiazepines (40%), amphetamines (38%), barbiturates (33%), opiates (25%), \nmethadone (20%) and cocaine (16%), along with inaccuracy in phencyclidine \ndetection. Immunoassay missed 890 of the 1,350 drug findings by definitive \ntesting, due to either high cutoff thresholds or limited testing scope.\nDISCUSSION: A high prevalence of drugs use by ED patients is evidenced with \nfrequent co-use of illicit and therapeutic drugs and with potential for \nunrecognized multi-serotonergic drug interactions. This study also shows the \nlimitations of immunoassay drug testing in both scope and sensitivity, with a \nhigh rate of undetected drug use.\nCONCLUSION: The study provides evidence-based support for recommended \nimplementation of definitive drug testing in emergency medicine as a guide to \nclinical management in drug-related ED visits."}

It is \ncharacterized by persistent inflammation and often leads to a considerable \ndecline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A subset of these \npatients-approximately 17.7%-have NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD), \na more severe form that frequently necessitates repeated sinus surgeries and \nrescue therapies. Compared with individuals without N-ERD, affected patients are \nmore prone to asthma flare-ups, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and loss of \nsmell. Treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) following desensitization \n(ATAD) has been suggested as a therapeutic option in cases of severe CRSwNP with \nN-ERD. While this approach may offer symptom improvement, decreased polyp \nburden, and enhanced QoL, it is not without risks, such as gastrointestinal \nirritation and bleeding complications. This randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trial (RDBCT) assesses the effectiveness and safety \nof ATAD in comparison with placebo in patients suffering from severe CRSwNP, \nN-ERD, and asthma. The study explores various outcomes, including reduction in \npolyp burden, improvement in QoL, treatment-related side effects, and biomarker \nanalyses derived from nasal swabs, blood, and urine samples.\nMETHODS: AirGOs Medical is an investigator-initiated RDBCT conducted at Helsinki \nUniversity Hospital.

This study aims to assess the prevalence of \nurogenital schistosomiasis and risk factors among school-aged children in the \nPru East district of Ghana. A cross-sectional study recruited 452 schoolchildren \nrandomly selected from the Basic Schools in the district between Nov. 2023 and \nOct. 2024. A questionnaire was used to obtain demographic, socio-economic, water \nsources and water collection practices, participants' knowledge of \nschistosomiasis, transmission, clinical manifestations, prevention, and control. \nA urine sample (20\u00a0ml) was collected from each participant between 10 am and 1 \npm. Samples were transported in a cold chain to the laboratory for assessment. \nThe prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was 9.3% and using pipe borne water \nwas associated with 64% reduction (aOR\u2009=\u20090.36, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.13-0.99, \np-value\u2009=\u20090.047). Washing near the river significantly increased the risk of \ninfection, with a 7-fold higher likelihood (aOR\u2009=\u20097.33, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.59-33.81, \np\u2009=\u20090.011). In contrast, individuals who were aware of schistosomiasis had a 98% \nreduced risk of infection, and those knowledgeable about its transmission had a \n96% lower risk compared to their counterparts. None of those recently exposed to \npraziquantel tested positive. Based on the prevalence of 9.3% obtained, the \nstudy area is at a hypo-endemic level for urogenital schistosomiasis. Frequent \nwashing near the river increases infection risk, highlighting the need for \nbehavioral and environmental interventions. People in the study areas should use \npipe borne water to reduce infection risk. Understanding schistosomiasis and its \ntransmission lowers the risk of infection, highlighting the importance of health \neducation in raising awareness. Praziquantel is highly effective in both \npreventing and treating schistosomiasis, reinforcing the need for comprehensive \ncontrol programs that integrate drug administration, education, and improved \nwater access."}

Electronic databases were searched in \nFebruary 2025. Clinical studies that meet the criteria were included in the \npresent study.\nRESULTS: Totally 116 cases were analyzed in this study, including 1 case in our \ncenter and 115 cases from 45 studies. The cohort included 82 males (70.7%) and \n34 females (29.3%), with ages ranging from 10 months to 18 years. The main \nclinical manifestations were fever (79.3%), respiratory symptoms (41.4%), and \nneurological symptoms (39.7%), followed by hepatosplenomegaly (35.3%), rash \n(27.6%), lymphadenopathy (18.1%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (16.4%). The \nmost commonly affected organs were the lungs (77.6%), central nervous system \n(53.4%), and lymph nodes (51.7%). Immunodeficiency was present in 12.9% of \nchildren (3.4% domestic cases vs. 9.5% foreign cases). Elevated eosinophils were \nobserved in 43 patients (37.1%), and elevated IgE levels in 35 patients (30.2%). \nThe most common pathogen-positive specimens were cerebrospinal fluid (54 cases, \n46.6%), blood cultures (49 cases, 42.2%), lymph node biopsies (26 cases, 22.4%), \nbone marrow (18 cases, 15.5%), and skin samples (8 cases, 6.9%). Combination \ntherapy was administered to 89 patients (76.7%), while 21 patients (18.1%) \nreceived monotherapy. Clinical improvement occurred in 94 patients (81.0%), with \n15 fatal cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Disseminated cryptococcosis in children often presents with fever, \nrespiratory and neurological symptoms, with the lungs, central nervous system, \nand lymph nodes being the most frequently involved organs. Most cases do not \nhave immunodeficiency or underlying diseases, and blood tests often reveal \neosinophilia and elevated IgE levels.

This study aims to improve understanding of Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome (SJS) induced by this monoclonal antibody and its treatment strategies.\nCASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of SJS induced by Sintilimab in a patient \ntreated at our hospital. The patient exhibited widespread erythema, papules, and \nvesicles, accompanied by mucosal erosion and exudation in the oral cavity, eyes, \nurethral orifice, and perianal region. The patient was immediately treated with \nintravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate (40 mg/day), antihistamines, and \nsupportive care, including fluid replacement and wound care. His symptoms \ngradually improved, and he was discharged after 20 days. At the 6-month \nfollow-up, he remained stable, with no recurrence of symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although severe drug rash, including SJS, caused by PD-1 inhibitors \nis relatively uncommon, its underlying molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. \nPhysicians should remain vigilant regarding potential adverse reactions when \nprescribing Sintilimab. If severe reactions occur, discontinuation of \nchemotherapy and immediate administration of adequate corticosteroids with \nsymptomatic support can help reduce morbidity and mortality."}

There are different diagnostic tools to evaluate \nsensitization to allergens in CAD; however, there is little information to \nevaluate the clinical usefulness of these tests.\nMETHODS: A systematic review aiming to assess the accuracy of allergen \nsensitization tests in CAD patients was performed. The search was planned, \nexecuted, and reported following PRISMA standards. The OVID\u00ae/MEDLINE, PubMed\u00ae, \nSciELO, and Redalyc databases were searched to find relevant studies comprising \n\"diagnostic method\" (OR test OR diagnosis OR method OR diagnostic OR \nparaclinic=) AND (atopic = OR hypersensitivity* OR allergen* OR \"allergic \nreaction*\" OR atopy) AND (dermatitis OR eczema OR scratching OR prurit = OR \nerythema OR rash OR edema) AND (canine OR dog* OR bitch* OR pupp*) search. \nDefined relevant articles were systematized, and content was analyzed via Atlas \nTI Scientific Software Development Software.\nRESULTS: The groups of diagnostic tests included the intradermal test (IDT), \nserologic-specific allergen test (SAT), skin prick test (SPT), and patch test. \nCombining the results from all the search engines and deduplicate elimination, \nyielded 928 eligible citations published between 1963 and 2024, and the 72 \narticles that met the eligibility criteria were included in the qualitative \nsynthesis evaluating SAT (n\u202f=\u202f36), IDT (n\u202f=\u202f37), SPT (n\u202f=\u202f2), and patch tests \n(n\u202f=\u202f1) reporting the use of 136 different allergens. Favrot's clinical criteria \nwere applied in 41.6% of the studies (30/72), with no previous consensus on the \ncase definition for CAD.\nDISCUSSION: The results of the review indicate that there is little information \navailable to establish the diagnostic performance of the tests, which makes it \ndifficult to make a recommendation regarding their use. In this systematic \nreview they identified gaps in current knowledge that suggest the need for \nfuture research to standardize allergenic extracts, define cutoff points in \nserological tests, and consider environmental, geographic, and demographic \nvariables. These findings provide a solid basis for improving the diagnosis and \nmanagement of CAD and guiding future research in this field.

Treatment \noptions include topical metronidazole and azelaic acid, and oral \ntetracycline-class antibiotics. While the broad-spectrum antibiotics are \nefficacious, they can lead to adverse gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, \nnegatively impact gut flora, and lead to antibiotic resistance. Narrow-spectrum \ntetracyclines, such as sarecycline, have a low potential for promoting bacterial \nresistance and GI issues.\nOBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to demonstrate \nsarecycline&rsquo;s efficacy and safety in treating POD. It was hypothesized \nthat subjects with POD given a 4-week course of sarecycline would have \nimprovement in their POD and tolerate the medication well.\nMETHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, pilot study to evaluate the \nefficacy, safety, and tolerability of sarecycline for the treatment of POD with \nonce-daily dosing over 4 consecutive weeks.

However, the analgesic properties of these medical treatments have \nbeen reported to be less than highly effective in some HZ patients. The factors \ninfluencing the efficacy of medical treatments for HZ patients are not yet fully \nunderstood, warranting further investigation.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the factors influencing the efficacy of \nmedical treatments in HZ patients and provide insights for clinical management \nof the condition.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.\nSETTING: This retrospective study included 76 individuals diagnosed with HZ who \nmet specific inclusion criteria and were receiving treatments at Changde \nHospital between February 2023 and December 2023.\nMETHODS: The patients were divided into 2 groups. Data on age, gender, family \nhistory, comorbidities, prior use of antiviral drugs, rash location, skin lesion \nseverity, HZ stage, visual analog scale (VAS) scores at admission and discharge, \nand responses to questionnaires were collected and statistically analyzed.\nRESULTS: The study revealed no significant differences in gender, family \nhistory, comorbidities, prior use of antiviral medication, rash location, or VAS \nscores between the 2\u00a0 groups of patients. However, the results demonstrated a \nsignificant correlation between the analgesic effects of medical treatments and \nage, skin lesion severity, disease duration, and plasma adrenocorticotropic \nhormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels. Depression, anxiety, and sleep quality also \ninfluenced the treatment outcomes.\nLIMITATIONS: The limitations of this study include the relatively small sample \nsize and the lack of long-term follow-up data.\nCONCLUSION: Age, skin lesion severity, disease duration, depression, sleep \nquality, and levels of anxiety and stress hormones are important factors \ninfluencing the efficacy of medical treatments for HZ patients."}

While a small carpal tunnel area is \nconsidered a risk factor for CTS, varying carpal tunnel dimensions in CTS \npatients have been obtained via axial computed tomography and magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI). Methods: In this retrospective study, MR images from 49 CTS \npatients and 38 healthy controls were analyzed to investigate differences in the \ncarpal tunnel area and carpal boundaries between the groups and to explore the \nrelationships of these parameters with CTS severity. Results: Our findings \nrevealed that compared with the controls, CTS patients presented significantly \nlarger cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the MN and carpal tunnel and increased MN \nflattening ratios. The CSAs of the MN showed moderate positive correlations with \nseverity (r = 0.395, p < 0.001), symptom score (r = 0.354, p < 0.001), and \ndisability score (r = 0.300, p < 0.001), while the carpal tunnel area showed \nweaker but significant correlations with severity (r = 0.268, p = 0.002), \nsymptom score (r = 0.173, p = 0.026), and disability score (r = 0.183, p = \n0.018). The ratios of the MN CSA to those of the carpal tunnel, the interior \ncarpal boundary (ICB), the exterior carpal boundary (ECB), and the wrist were \ndisproportionately greater in the CTS patients. Among them, both the MN-to-ICB \nand MN-to-ECB ratios had fair to good diagnostic values (area under the curve = \n0.725 and 0.794, respectively). Conclusions: These results highlight the utility \nof MRI-derived CSA measurements and ratios in identifying pathophysiological \nchanges in CTS patients, particularly crowding of the MN inside the carpal \ntunnel. Further studies are recommended to refine MRI-based diagnostic protocols \nfor CTS."}

Although commonly regarded as trivial, it involves \ncomplex neurobiological mechanisms and diverse behavioral phenomena observed \nacross species. Two distinct forms exist: knismesis, a mild tingling sensation \nelicited by gentle touch, and gargalesis, an intense sensation associated with \ninvoluntary laughter. Advocating the importance of clearly distinguishing these \ntwo types of ticklishness, this review synthesizes current knowledge on their \nneuronal underpinnings. Topics include somatosensory processing, self-tickling \nand sensory attenuation, emotional modulation, sociosexual dimensions, and \nevolutionary perspectives, among others. Special attention is given to the \nambivalent nature of gargalesis, challenging conventional single-dimensional \nmodels of emotional valence. Ultimately, studying ticklishness provides a \nvaluable opportunity to investigate playful emotional experiences from a \nnaturalistic perspective, addressing fundamental yet underrepresented questions \nin contemporary neuroscience. Far from trivial, ticklishness thus provides \nvaluable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying complex, \ncontext-dependent emotional and social experiences."}

The results indicate \nthat the addition of acetic acid and hexanoic acid at low to medium \nconcentrations (< 1000\u00a0mg/L) led to a reduction in both the maximum intensity \nand overall intensity of pungency. However, the addition of these acids at high \nconcentrations increased the maximum and overall pungency intensity.

The suppression of pungency by organic acids is likely related to \ninteractions between sourness and pungency, changes in ester-to-acid ratios, and \nincreased saliva stimulation.

This \nprocedure allows for improved performance and comfort and can minimize the risk \nof injuries to cyclists.\nOBJECTIVE: To analyze the main musculoskeletal complaints reported by cyclists \nwho sought a Bike Fit service.\nMETHODS: Observational and cross-sectional study. Professionals who perform Bike \nFit in different regions of Brazil were invited to participate in the research. \nVolunteers filled out electronic forms with data extracted from medical records \nof patients they had already treated. For this study, data from 1505 cyclists \nwere used. Absolute number (n), relative number (%), 95% confidence interval \n(95% CI) and prevalence ratio (PR) were analyzed in men and women. Fisher's \nexact test and Cohen's were used to analyze differences between genders.\nRESULTS: 29.1% of reported complaints were pain in the lumbar spine, 21.5% \nnumbness in the hands and/or fingers, 19.5% pain in the knees, 14% pain in the \nneck, and 11.5% numbness in the feet and/or fingers. The type of complaint and \nprevalence of complaints were similar in male and female cyclists.\nCONCLUSION: The main neuromusculoskeletal complaints involve low back pain, \nparesthesia in the hands or fingers, neck pain, and paresthesia in the feet or \ntoes. These findings can contribute to more assertive decision-making by \nprofessionals who work with cyclists' health."}

Firstly, \nnetwork pharmacology was adopted to predict potential drug targets and molecular \npathways of AKI by utilizing the active ingredients in JHD. Secondly, molecular \ndocking was used to explore the affinity between the active ingredients of JHD \nand AKI targets. Thirdly, biochemical analysis and histopathology were performed \nto estimate JHD's impact on cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Finally, quantitative \nreal-time PCR, Western blot, lipid/immunofluorescence staining, and untargeted \nmetabolomics were performed to understand the underlying mechanisms in vivo.\nRESULTS: In silico analysis identified 184 active compounds and 394 targets of \nJHD. Topology analysis based on the PPI network indicated 7 main targets. The GO \nand KEGG enriched signaling pathways pointed to metabolic changes due to JHD's \neffects on AKI. Molecular docking screening revealed that TP53, SRC, MAPK1, \nMAPK2, and AKT1 were the key targets of JHD. Further molecular biology and \nuntargeted metabolomics experiments revealed that fatty acid uptake (CD36) and \nlipogenesis (sphingolipids, phospholipids, and neutral lipids) mediated by the \np53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway may be involved in the protective effects \nof JHD against AKI in vivo.\nCONCLUSION: JHD exerted therapeutic effects on AKI by regulating fatty acid \nuptake and lipogenesis via the p53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway."}

TP53 mutations were detected in 28 patients (52.8\u202f%), and 17 \npatients (32.1\u202f%) showed positive ichorCNA TF. Combining TP53 mutation detection \nwith ichorCNA TF identified 62.3\u202f% (n\u202f=\u202f33) of patients as ctDNA-positive, \nshowing a trend towards improved detection compared to TP53 mutation alone \n(p\u202f=\u202f.063).

The TP53 exon 4 Arg72Pro polymorphism \n(rs1042522) influenced several BIA parameters, including calf circumference \n(P\u2009=\u20090.013), protein levels (P\u2009=\u20090.022), mineral levels (P\u2009=\u20090.049), body cell \nmass (BCM; P\u2009=\u20090.027), and arm muscle circumference (AMC; P\u2009=\u20090.010). The CC \ngenotype exhibited significantly higher values than the TC genotype. Significant \ndifferences were observed among TP53 haplotypes for protein levels (P\u2009=\u20090.012), \nmineral levels (P\u2009=\u20090.020), fat-free mass (FFM; P\u2009=\u20090.033), BCM (P\u2009=\u20090.012), and \nbone mineral content (BMC; P\u2009=\u20090.043).

However, \ntheir relationship remains unclear. This study aims to explore the relationship \nbetween angiogenesis-related genes and TACE failure in patients with HCC and to \ndevelop a predictive model for assessing treatment outcomes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Somatic mutation profiles of 165 patients with HCC \ntreated with TACE were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Multivariate \nCox regression analysis was performed to calculate the genetic risk score (GRS) \nfor angiogenesis-related gene mutations. The participants were randomly divided \ninto training and validation groups. In the training set, independent prognostic \nfactors of TACE-treated patients with HCC were screened using univariate \nCox-LASSO-stepwise Cox regression, and a nomogram was established and evaluated \nusing the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and \ndecision curve analysis of the two sets.\nRESULTS: Among 165 patients, significant genetic alterations were identified, \nwith TP53 being the most frequently mutated gene. Mutations in FGFR4, MST1R, and \nRECK were associated with the treatment efficacy of patients receiving TACE \ntreatment, and the constructed GRS was associated with poor prognosis. \nFurthermore, AFP, ALT, AST, PLR, PD-L1 immune drug treatment, and GRS were \nconfirmed as independent factors affecting the prognosis of patients with HCC \ntreated with TACE. A nomogram was constructed, which demonstrated excellent \ndiscrimination, calibration, and clinical benefits in both the training and \nvalidation sets.\nCONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical role of angiogenesis-related \ngenes in predicting TACE outcomes in patients with HCC and indicate that the \ndeveloped prognostic model and nomogram can serve as valuable tools to predict \nprognosis based on the GRS of angiogenesis-associated gene mutations.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings highlight the critical role of \nangiogenesis-related genes in predicting TACE outcomes in HCC patients.

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "EGFR", "text": "Plain Language Summary: This study describes treatment patterns in patients with \na type of lung cancer that is caused by a mutation in a gene called the \nepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Many kinds of EGFR mutations have been \nidentified and are grouped as \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cuncommon\u201d mutations. Patients with \nEGFR mutation-positive cancer are usually treated with tablets called EGFR \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which are very effective at silencing \nabnormal forms of EGFR that drive tumor growth. Unfortunately, tumors may \neventually become resistant to EGFR TKIs and alternative treatments are required \n(named \u201csecond-line treatments\u201d). There are several types of EGFR TKI available: \nfirst-generation (e.g. gefitinib, erlotinib); second-generation (e.g. afatinib, \ndacomitinib) and third-generation (osimertinib) TKIs. A few unanswered questions \nremain regarding the optimal use of EGFR TKIs. Firstly, which EGFR TKI is most \neffective against uncommon EGFR mutations and, secondly, what is the most \neffective second-line treatment after first-line treatment with an EGFR TKI? In \nthis study, we reviewed treatment patterns in 805 patients with lung cancer in \nJapan who received afatinib. We found that half of patients remained on \ntreatment for at least 13\u2009months, providing further evidence that afatinib is an \neffective therapy. Afatinib was effective in patients with uncommon and common \nEGFR mutations. The most common second-line treatment after afatinib was \nchemotherapy. Approximately a third of patients received another EGFR TKI after \nafatinib, most commonly osimertinib, which was the most effective second-line \ntreatment. Sequential afatinib and osimertinib treatment should be considered."}

As reference groups, we included an age- and sex-matched cohort of \n80,131 individuals with diabetes and mild-to-moderate CKD (eGFR 30-59 \nmL/min/1.73 m2) and 80,797 individuals with diabetes and no-to-mild CKD (eGFR \n\u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2). Multiple Cox regressions were used to estimate the \nstandardized 1-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), \nmicrovascular complications, and hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia across \nstrata of HbA1c levels.\nRESULTS: For individuals with severe CKD, the risk of MACE significantly \nincreased at HbA1c levels \u22657.2% (55 mmol/mol) (P < 0.01) and <5.8% (40 mmol/mol) \n(P < 0.001), compared with an HbA1c level of 6.3-6.6% (45-49 mmol/mol). The risk \nof microvascular complications significantly increased at HbA1c levels \u22657.2% (55 \nmmol/mol) (P < 0.001), and the risk of hospitalization due to hypoglycemia \nsignificantly increased at HbA1c levels \u22656.7% (50 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001). The \nassociation patterns between HbA1c and outcomes were similar in the severe CKD \ncohort compared with the matched cohorts with mild-to-moderate CKD and \nno-to-mild CKD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest an HbA1c range of 6.7-7.1% (50-54 mmol/mol) to be \nmost favorable for reducing long-term complications in this high-risk \npopulation."}

Epidermal growth factor receptor \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) serve as pivotal therapeutic agents for \nnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, considerable interindividual \nvariability exists in drug exposure, along with a high incidence and severity of \nadverse events. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the impacts of \nEGFR TKI exposure and other covariates on the severity of the maximum grade of \ndrug-related adverse events (MDRAE) in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs. \nData were collected from 277 patients treated with gefitinib, icotinib, afatinib \nor osimertinib. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models were constructed for \neach drug, and individual exposure metrics were derived through model \nsimulations. Normalized individual exposures to different EGFR TKIs based on \ntheir IC50 values and MDRAE data were integrated to develop an ordinal logistic \nregression model for an exposure-safety analysis. A user-friendly nomogram was \nsubsequently designed. The probability of high-grade MDRAE was significantly \nassociated with normalized exposure levels, a history of EGFR TKI treatment, sex \nand other factors. Model simulations revealed substantial interindividual \nvariability in drug exposure and the probability of different grades of MDRAE \nfor the same treatment regimen. This study quantitatively elucidates the \ninfluences of drug exposure and other critical factors on safety, thereby \ncontributing to the formulation of individualized treatment strategies to \nprevent and promptly address drug safety-related issues."}

This study aimed to \ndescribe the impact of clinical and host factors including bilateral \noophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA \nmutation carriers.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study extends from a longitudinal observational \nstudy of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that has been ongoing since 1995. \nThe Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among \n752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability \nof amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test \ncompletion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, \nand was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host \nfactors were collected from biennial research questionnaires.\nRESULTS: There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild \ncognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a \nhigh probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 \nvs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer \nprevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low \nprobability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women \nwith a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those \nwith a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04).\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy \non the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation \ncarriers. A higher probability was predominantly attributed to older age at \ncognitive assessment. It is prudent to continue to monitor this population for \npotential long-term adverse effects following preventive surgery or cancer \ntreatment."}

A \n3\u2009+\u20093 design was utilized for dose escalation. The primary objective of the \nphase II study was objective response rate (ORR) in the patients with wildtype \ngermline BRCA1/2. The prespecified efficacy threshold was 20%. Secondary \nobjectives included progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as \ncorrelative testing, examining homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status.\nRESULTS: The combination of gedatolisib and talazoparib carried manageable \ntoxicities with a low incidence of grade 3 adverse events. The most common \nadverse events of all grades were anemia, fatigue, and oral mucositis. The ORR \nin the phase II study was 12%. There were no new safety signals identified in \nthe phase II study. mPFS was 2.5\u00a0months (95% CI 1.71, 9.89), and mOS was \n7\u00a0months (95% CI 4.3, NA) in the full phase II cohort. HRD status was analyzed \nby high (\u2265\u200933) or low (<\u200933) genomic instability score, and there was no \ndifference in response rate between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of gedatolisib and talazoparib is safe but did not \nmeet the prespecified efficacy threshold for objective response rate.

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "BRCA1", "text": "BACKGROUND: PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS) patients have a high \nhereditary risk of cancer, especially breast (BC), endometrial (EC), and thyroid \ncancer (TC). However, the prognosis of PHTS-related cancers is unknown.\nMETHODS: This European cohort study included adult PHTS patients with data from \nmedical files, registries, and/or questionnaires. Overall survival (OS) was \nassessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and were compared with sporadic cancer and \nthe general population using standardized mortality (SMR) and relative survival \nrates (RSR). Survival bias was addressed using left-truncation.\nRESULTS: Overall, 147 BC patients were included. The 10y-OS was \n77%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200966-90), decreasing with increasing stage from 90%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200973-100) \nfor stage 0 to 0%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u20090-0) for stage IV. BC relative survival was \ncomparable to sporadic BC in the first two years (2y-RSR\u2009=\u20091.1;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20091.1-1.1) \nand increasing thereafter (5y-RSR\u2009=\u20091.7;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20091.6-1.7). For TC (N\u2009=\u200956) and \nEC (N\u2009=\u200935), 10y-OS was 87%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200974-100) and 64%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200938-100), \nrespectively. Overall and cancer-specific mortality in female PHTS patients \nexceeded general population rates (SMR\u2009=\u20093.7;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20092.6-5.0 and \nSMR\u2009=\u20092.7;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20091.6-4.4).\nCONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of PHTS-related cancers was comparable to the general \npopulation. The higher overall mortality in PHTS patients is presumably related \nto their higher cancer incidence. These findings, and the high survival observed \nin early-stage cancer, emphasise the importance of recognising PHTS early to \nfacilitate cancer surveillance."}

Poly(adenosine \ndiphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, the only treatment demonstrated to \nimprove the prognosis of patients with mCRPC, are also being developed for the \ntreatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). \nTo fully assess their potential benefit in this setting, it is essential to \nunderstand how BRCA and HRR defects may influence the prognosis of \nconventionally treated patients with low- and high-disease volume.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible mHSPC patients diagnosed between January 2018 and \nDecember 2023 underwent paired somatic/germline DNA sequencing. Cases with \nalterations in \u22651 HRR gene were classified as BRCA, HRR non-BRCA, non-BRCA or \nnon-HRR. Radiographic progression-free survival, time to castration resistance, \nand overall survival were reported for all subgroups; associations between \nmutations and outcomes were assessed after controlling for treatment modality \nand baseline characteristics using inverse probability of treatment weighting \nmodels.\nRESULTS: Of 556 patients, 159 (28.6%) had HRR gene alterations: 69 (12.4%) with \nBRCA and 90 (16.2%) with HRR non-BRCA mutations. mHSPC was synchronous in 451 \npatients (81.1%) and was classified as high-volume (CHAARTED criteria) in 306 \n(55%) patients. Within the HRR subgroup, patients with BRCA mutations had \nsignificantly worse outcomes across all endpoints (P < 0.005 for all \ncomparisons). Differences in prognosis by BRCA and HRR status were observed in \nboth low- and high-volume subgroups and were independent of treatment with \nandrogen receptor pathway inhibitors or taxanes.\nCONCLUSION: Presence of HRR mutations, particularly BRCA alterations, \nsignificantly worsened prognosis, regardless of disease volume or treatment \nregimen. These findings underscore the importance of integrating tumour biology \nfor accurate risk stratification in mHSPC and the design of new treatment \nstrategies and follow-up."}

We aimed to \ndetermine this in patients with GC undergoing germline genetic testing at a \nlarge commercial laboratory.\nMETHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Retrospective review of genetic \ntesting in patients with GC at a commercial laboratory (Invitae Corp) from March \n2015 to July 2023 was performed. Prevalence of PGVs was determined and compared \nwith a control cohort of 20,139 individuals unaffected by cancer. Data were \nabstracted from test requisition forms.\nRESULTS: In total, 3,706 patients with GC underwent genetic testing, of which \n494 (13.3%) patients carried PGVs, 1,200 (32.4%) had variants of uncertain \nsignificance, and 1,890 (51%) had negative testing. PGVs were identified in 38 \ngenes, of which 385 of 494 (77.9%) were in a gene previously associated with GC, \nincluding 35% in homologous recombination repair genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and \nATM), 19.5% in Hereditary Diffuse GC genes (CDH1 and CTNNA1), and 17.4% in Lynch \nsyndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM). Comparing the GC cohort with \nthe unaffected cohort, it was found that there was significant enrichment of \nPGVs in most GC-associated genes, except for APC, EPCAM, MUTYH, and PMS2. Odds \nof carrying a PGV was increased significantly in males and patients with a \npersonal history of another cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to \n1.6) and OR, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.7), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: In this large study of genetic testing in patients with GC, more \nthan one in eight patients referred for germline testing was found to harbor a \nPGV in a cancer predisposition gene, which is higher than previous estimates. \nMost PGVs were identified in genes previously associated with GC."}

However, in the clinical oncology setting it is still \nrestricted to large panel sequencing limiting capacity for routine biomarker \nscreening. In this article, we describe our experience of tailoring \namplicon-based library construction for the MGI platform. Illumina compatible \nreagents served as a prototype in order to introduce platform specific adapters. \nElaborated reagent kits were used for BRCA1/2 or 34 oncogenes testing both with \nwhole blood and FFPE-derived DNA. Our data show that amplicon-based \nDNBSEQ-tailored library preparation demonstrates sufficient analytical \nefficiency in terms of coverage uniformity (average MAPD 1.08 and 1.19 for ABC \nplus and Atlas plus panels) and amplicon drop-out rate (ranging from 0.3% to \n2.5%). Additionally, it shows efficiency in terms of single sample sensitivity, \nmaintaining 99% sensitivity compared to 99% for the Illumina prototype. We show \nthat it also outreaches expected diagnostic parameters of MGI exome sequencing \n(99% vs 95% for WES). Per-amplicon coverage of sticky-end libraries sequenced on \nIllumina and MGI were highly correlated demonstrating that the platform itself \ndoes not introduce any bias to amplicon coverage. Across three tested variations \nof library preparation protocol, discordances were related to ligation mix \ncomponent composition and resulted in underrepresentation of GC-low and GC-high \namplicons and low uniformity as a result. Overall, we outline the successful \nadaptation of PCR-based library preparation for MGI signifying the importance of \ntailoring component composition of reagent kit for uniform coverage."}

MD metrics [Percent density (PD), dense area (DA), and non-dense \narea (NDA)] were quantified using STRATUS. Multivariable linear mixed models \nassessed changes in MD metrics between groups, adjusting for confounders.\nRESULTS: Mean PD at first mammogram was 26.8% \u00b1 15.3 (RRSO) and 31.3% \u00b1 18.1 (no \nRRSO). In a median 1.1 years between mammograms, PD decreased on average 0.9% \n(95% CI: -1.6; -0.2) among women who did not undergo RRSO in the interval \nbetween mammograms compared to 5.9% (95% CI: -7.4; -4.5) among women who \nunderwent RRSO in the interval (adjusted difference: -5.9%, 95%CI: -9.5; -2.2, \np=0.002). Results were driven primarily by MD changes among BRCA2 PGV carriers. \nUse of HRT after RRSO attenuated the decline in PD.\nCONCLUSIONS: On average, PD and DA decrease following RRSO in premenopausal \ncarriers, particularly among BRCA2 PGV carriers.

This study aimed to \ndescribe the impact of clinical and host factors including bilateral \noophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA \nmutation carriers.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study extends from a longitudinal observational \nstudy of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that has been ongoing since 1995. \nThe Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among \n752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability \nof amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test \ncompletion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, \nand was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host \nfactors were collected from biennial research questionnaires.\nRESULTS: There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild \ncognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a \nhigh probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 \nvs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer \nprevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low \nprobability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women \nwith a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those \nwith a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04).\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy \non the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation \ncarriers. A higher probability was predominantly attributed to older age at \ncognitive assessment. It is prudent to continue to monitor this population for \npotential long-term adverse effects following preventive surgery or cancer \ntreatment."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "BRCA2", "text": "BACKGROUND: PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS) patients have a high \nhereditary risk of cancer, especially breast (BC), endometrial (EC), and thyroid \ncancer (TC). However, the prognosis of PHTS-related cancers is unknown.\nMETHODS: This European cohort study included adult PHTS patients with data from \nmedical files, registries, and/or questionnaires. Overall survival (OS) was \nassessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and were compared with sporadic cancer and \nthe general population using standardized mortality (SMR) and relative survival \nrates (RSR). Survival bias was addressed using left-truncation.\nRESULTS: Overall, 147 BC patients were included. The 10y-OS was \n77%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200966-90), decreasing with increasing stage from 90%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200973-100) \nfor stage 0 to 0%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u20090-0) for stage IV. BC relative survival was \ncomparable to sporadic BC in the first two years (2y-RSR\u2009=\u20091.1;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20091.1-1.1) \nand increasing thereafter (5y-RSR\u2009=\u20091.7;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20091.6-1.7). For TC (N\u2009=\u200956) and \nEC (N\u2009=\u200935), 10y-OS was 87%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200974-100) and 64%\u00a0(95%CI\u2009=\u200938-100), \nrespectively. Overall and cancer-specific mortality in female PHTS patients \nexceeded general population rates (SMR\u2009=\u20093.7;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20092.6-5.0 and \nSMR\u2009=\u20092.7;\u00a095%CI\u2009=\u20091.6-4.4).\nCONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of PHTS-related cancers was comparable to the general \npopulation. The higher overall mortality in PHTS patients is presumably related \nto their higher cancer incidence. These findings, and the high survival observed \nin early-stage cancer, emphasise the importance of recognising PHTS early to \nfacilitate cancer surveillance."}

Carriers of BRCA2 PVs (N\u2009=\u20091629) had a \nsignificantly increased risk for four core HBOC-associated cancers (breast, \novarian, pancreatic, and prostate) and six additional types of cancer (lung, \noral, small intestine, larynx, liver, and mesothelioma), hazard ratio (HR) \n>\u20092.37, all ps\u2009<\u20090.001. For eight cancers where cancer-specific PGS is \navailable, each PGS was significantly associated with its respective cancer risk \nand independent of BRCA2, HR\u2009>\u20091.25 for 1\u2009unit increase in standard deviation, \nall ps\u2009<\u20090.001. For female breast and prostate cancer, a significant interaction \nbetween BRCA2 and PGS was found (HR\u2009<\u20090.83, p\u2009<\u20090.05); the effect of PGS on \ncancer risk was weaker in carriers than noncarriers. The probability of cancer \nby age 75\u2009years (P75) for these 10 cancers increased with higher PGS deciles in \nboth carriers and noncarriers. For several cancers, the P75 in carriers with the \nlowest PGS decile was lower than that of noncarriers with the highest PGS \ndecile.\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA2 PVs increase risk beyond core HBOC cancers and their risks \nare modified by cancer-specific PGS. These results suggest that genetic \ncounseling of BRCA2 PV carriers may extend to cancers beyond core HBOC syndrome \nand incorporate cancer-specific PGS in estimating their penetrance."}

Since 2018, five new therapies have been \nintroduced into clinical practice for the treatment of advanced TNBC. \nPoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors represent the only success for \ngenomically targeted therapy, and this is an option only for a small subgroup of \npatients with TNBC and a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant. \nPembrolizumab is currently the only PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor approved in the \nUnited States in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting and is \nan option for roughly 40% of patients with PD-L1 positive tumors. Antibody-drug \nconjugates have been an important advance in the treatment of advanced TNBC, \nalthough these drugs do not represent a TNBC-specific advance as both \nsacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan have activity in breast tumors \nbeyond TNBC. Thus, despite significant strides over the past decade, significant \nunmet clinical need persists, and novel therapeutics remain a pressing need for \nthe treatment of advanced TNBC."}

Reversion mutations that restore homologous \nrecombination (HR) repair are detected in ~50 to 80% of BRCA-mutant patients who \nrespond but subsequently relapse, but there is currently little insight into why \nonly ~50% of BRCA-mutant patients display upfront resistance. To address this \nquestion, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genomic \ndeterminants of PARPi resistance in murine Brca2\u0394/\u0394 prostate organoids \ngenetically engineered in a manner that precludes the development of reversion \nmutations. Remarkably, we recovered multiple independent single guide RNAs \n(sgRNAs) targeting three different members (Cdt1, Cdc6, and Dbf4) of the DNA \nprereplication complex (pre-RC), each of which independently conferred \nresistance to olaparib and the next-generation PARP-1 selective inhibitor \nAZD5305. Moreover, sensitivity to PARP inhibition was restored in Brca2\u0394/\u0394, \nCdc6-depleted prostate cells by knockdown of geminin, a negative regulator of \nCdt1, further implicating the critical role of a functional pre-RC complex in \nPARPi sensitivity. Furthermore, ~50% of CRPC tumors have copy number loss of \npre-RC complex genes, particularly CDT1. Mechanistically, prostate cells with \nimpaired pre-RC activity displayed rapid resolution of olaparib-induced DNA \ndamage as well as protection from replication fork degradation caused by Brca2 \nloss, providing insight into how Brca2-mutant cancer cells can escape cell death \nfrom replication stress induced by PARP inhibition in the absence of HR repair. \nOf note, a pharmacologic inhibitor that targets the CDT1/geminin complex (AF615) \nrestored sensitivity to AZD5305, providing a potential translational avenue to \nenhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "BRCA2", "text": "PURPOSE: Second primary cancers (SPCs) are independent primary cancers that \ndevelop separately from pre-existing malignancies, distinct from metastasis or \nrecurrence. This study aims to review the current literature and analyse the \nassociation between melanoma and colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as the factors \ncontributing to the development of these SPCs.\nMETHODS: A scoping review was conducted, including 21 independent studies. \nPatient data from these studies were analysed and reviewed alongside relevant \nbiological and lifestyle factors.\nRESULTS: The studies reported standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for a second \nprimary colorectal cancer (CRC) following a melanoma diagnosis ranging from 0.62 \nto 1.55, while SIRs for a second primary melanoma following a CRC diagnosis \nranged from 0.89 to 1.55. Males exhibited a higher risk of developing either CRC \nor melanoma as a second primary cancer (SPC). An inverse relationship between \nage and the development of CRC was observed, with younger individuals having a \nhigher risk. African-American populations demonstrated a higher prevalence of \nmelanoma and CRC as SPCs compared to Caucasian and other racial groups. \nLifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and the intake of \nred and processed meats were associated with an increased risk of developing \nmelanoma or CRC. Genetic mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were commonly \nimplicated in the development of both melanoma and CRC, while mutations in \nCDKN2A and BRCA2 were specifically significant in melanoma.\nCONCLUSION: The association between melanoma and CRC incidence was confirmed \nthrough analysis of current literature and is influenced by various biological, \nlifestyle, and genetic factors. Understanding these correlations is crucial for \npredicting the risk of SPCs and enhancing the follow-up care of melanoma and CRC \nsurvivors."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "BRCA2", "text": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of cases with gastric cancer (GC) exhibit familial \nclustering, however, only 1-3% of cases can be explained by two known hereditary \nsyndromes: Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) caused by CDH1 and CTNNA1 \npathogenic germline variants; and Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis \nof the Stomach (GAPPS), caused by germline variants in APC 1B promoter. Familial \nintestinal gastric cancer (FIGC) has been defined clinically, but it remains \nmostly genetically unexplained. Likewise, the heritability of mixed histology GC \nremains to be known. We aimed to estimate the frequency of known cancer \npredisposition gene variants in GC cases with and without a cancer family \nhistory, diverse histological subtypes, and varied age of onset.\nMETHODS: We evaluated the contribution of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) \nvariants in well-established moderate-to-high penetrance multi-organ cancer \npredisposition genes for GC risk in a large international multi-centre \nretrospective cohort study involving 750 patients with GC of early-onset or \nfamily history of cancer, either by panel sequencing or whole exome sequencing \n(WES). Panel sequencing was conducted on 328 cases, while WES was performed on \nthe remaining 422. Tumour sequence analyses were performed on samples from 15 \npatients with P/LP variants. Mutations identified in five index cases were also \ntested in their relatives.\nFINDINGS: We identified 45 patients (6%) with P/LP variants in: ATM (17 cases), \nBRCA2 (10 cases), MLH1 (five cases), TP53 (three cases), BRCA1, PALB2, RAD51D, \nand CHEK2 (two patients each), and RAD51C and PMS2 (one case each), all of which \nwere mutually exclusive. The P/LP variant prevalence was higher in intestinal \n(9.8%) than in diffuse (4.3%) or mixed GC (4.5%) (p-value = 0.023), without \ndifference per mutated gene by histological subtypes. Only 16 of the 45 patients \nwho carried P/LP variants fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network \ngenetic testing criteria of at least one cancer predisposition syndrome.\nINTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that a broader panel of cancer \npredisposition genes, beyond CDH1 and CTNNA1, should be included in gene panels \nto investigate germline variants in patients with GC. This would be especially \nbeneficial when there is a family history of cancer, irrespective of histology \nsubtype, as it would increase the chance of identifying patients who could \nbenefit from risk reduction, targeted treatment, and surveillance of other \ncancer types.\nFUNDING: National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health, USA; \nUniversidad del Tolima, Colombia; MINCIENCIAS, Colombia; \nL'OREAL-UNESCO-ICETEX-COLCIENCIAS, Colombia; Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda, \nColombia; American Association for Cancer Research, USA; ANID Ministerio de \nCiencia, Chile; Fondecyt, Chile; CONICYT/ANID FONDAP, Chile; Instituto Mexicano \ndel Seguro Social and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda, M\u00e9xico; IPO \nPorto, Portugal; Liga Portuguesa Contra o Cancro, Portugal; Fundacao para a \nCiencia e Tecnologia, Portugal; The Auburn Community Cancer Endowed Chair in \nBasic Research, USA; The Heart, BrEast, and BrAin HeaLth Equity Research (HEAL \nHER) program, a program made possible by residual class settlement funds in the \nmatter of April Krueger v.

This study aimed to identify potential \ntherapeutic targets for LUAD through the integration and analysis of multi-omics \ndatasets.\nMETHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted using two extensive proteomics datasets, \nthe UK Biobank Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) and the Fenland study, to identify \ndisease-associated targets for LUAD through the Summary-Data-Based Mendelian \nRandomization method. Sensitivity analysis, including heterogeneity tests for \ndependent instruments, were conducted to validate the findings. The prognostic \nrelevance of the identified candidate targets was assessed using transcriptomic \ndata. Functional interactions were explored via protein-protein interaction \nnetwork analysis, while single-cell analyses were employed to determine \ncell-specific expression patterns and differentiation trajectories. Potential \nside effects and therapeutic indications of these targets were evaluated using \nphenome-wide association studies and pharmacological data mining.\nRESULTS: Following meta-analysis, a primary significant target, intercellular \nadhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5), along with potential targets FUT8 and KLK13, were \nidentified as therapeutic candidates for LUAD. FUT8 demonstrated a positive \nassociation with LUAD risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.02, p\u2009=\u20090.049), while ICAM5 (OR\u2009=\u20090.88, \np\u2009=\u20090.002) and KLK13 (OR\u2009=\u20090.85, p\u2009=\u20090.021) exhibited negative associations. \nICAM5 was further identified as an independent prognostic factor for patient \nsurvival (HR: 0.788, 95% CI: 0.663-0.936, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and revealed significant \ndiagnostic and prognostic utility in LUAD. ICAM5 expression correlated with \nvarious immune infiltration patterns, suggesting potential modulation of the \ntumor immune microenvironment. Single-cell analysis revealed that ICAM5 did not \ndirectly impact LUAD cell differentiation, though its downstream target, MUC1, \nmay contribute to differentiation processes, particularly in KRAS-mutated LUAD. \nFurthermore, phenome-wide association studies did not reveal substantial \nevidence of adverse phenotypes linked to ICAM5, supporting its safety profile \nfor drug development.\nCONCLUSION: ICAM5 emerges as a promising biological marker with significant \nprognostic and therapeutic potential in LUAD."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "KRAS", "text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited \nresponsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or \nrecurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an \nindolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, \nhighlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, \ntrametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 \n(CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the \nrepurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast \ncancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to \nimprove outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes \nevidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer \ntherapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of \nrapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian \ncancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG \n281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, \nmolecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, \nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, \nand CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer \nprovide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies \ndemonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when \ncombined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 \ninhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the \nresponse to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin \ninhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the \nimportance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and \nendocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade \nserous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited \ntreatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates \nprecise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies \nleveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical \nfor refining these approaches.

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "KRAS", "text": "Lung cancer remains one of the major causes of cancer-related mortality. Thus, \nnewer therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Because cancer is a metabolic \ndisease, lung cancer cells have also rewired their metabolism to gain growth \nadvantage and support survival. Therefore, the use of metabolic stress-inducing \nagents as a therapeutic strategy for lung cancer is an attractive idea. In this \nstudy, we have investigated the anticancer potential of CB-839 and metformin. \nCB-839, a selective glutaminase-1 inhibitor, creates glutamine-deficient \nconditions, and metformin is an antidiabetic drug. We report that CB-839 and \nmetformin induce metabolic stress and inhibit growth of human lung cancer cells. \nOf note, lung cancer cells that harbor mutant K-Ras are more sensitive to these \nagents compared to cells with wild-type K-Ras status. In the K-Ras mutant cells, \nthese agents induce cell death partly, via death receptor 5 (DR5)-dependent \nextrinsic pathway. However, in the lung cancer cells harboring wild-type K-Ras, \nthese agents activate autophagy without significant effect on DR5 regulation. \nPretreatment of K-Ras wild-type cells with autophagy inhibitor improves the \nanticancer potential of these agents coupled with activation of DR5-dependent \npathway. Our results further show that the growth inhibitory effects of these \nagents appear to be linked to the mutant K-Ras status because pan-K-Ras \ninhibitor that inhibits the mutant K-Ras proteins blunted the growth inhibitory \neffects of these agents in cells harboring mutant K-Ras. Collectively, our \nresults provide valuable new insights into exploiting the metabolic rewiring of \nlung cancer cells by using metabolic stress-inducing drugs as an important \ntherapeutic approach. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Anticancer potential of CB-839 and \nmetformin is investigated in lung cancer. These agents induce cell death partly, \nvia death receptor 5-dependent pathway, and a relationship with K-Ras status of \nlung cancer cells is noted. Lung cancer cells with mutant K-Ras are more \nsensitive compared to cells with wild-type K-Ras. Autophagy inhibition of K-Ras \nwild-type cells improves the anticancer potential. This study provides new \ninsights into exploiting the metabolic rewiring of lung cancer cells as an \nimportant therapeutic strategy."}

IDO-1-related immune suppression is due to \ndecreased tryptophan availability and to the generation of tryptophan \nmetabolites, culminating in substantial suppression of T-lymphocytes. Here we \ninvestigate IDO-1 expression in 2 cohorts of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \nspecimens, both in tumor cells and in immune infiltrate, with correlation of \nIDO-1 to PD-L1 expression, clinical patient demographics and outcomes.\nMETHODS: Evaluation first utilized an exploratory cohort of 259 NSCLC samples \nobtained from 122 patients followed by a second validating cohort of 1,200 NSCLC \nsamples obtained from 437 patients. All tumor samples were collected from \npatients who underwent surgical lung resections. IDO-1 expression was evaluated \nby immunohistochemistry (IHC). Correlations were assessed using Spearman and \nKendall tests. A Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was used to assess if \noverall survival (OS) was associated with IDO-1 positivity in univariate and \nmultivariable settings.\nRESULTS: In the validating cohort of 437 patients IDO-1 expression was positive \nin 111 (25.4%) with an H-Score \u2265 1. IDO-1 expression was determined to be \ngreater in tumor immune infiltrate, with 406 patients (93.8%) determined as \npositive. Both continuous and binary versions of tumor H-Score showed a \nsignificant positive correlation with the amount of tumor immune infiltrate \n(0.1806 and 0.1698, p < 0.0001). None of the analyzed variables (age, sex, \nhistology, stage, EGFR, KRAS and PD-L1 status) were found to display a \nsignificant correlation with IDO-1 positivity in tumor and immune cells. IDO-1 \npositivity in tumor cells was found to be significantly associated with OS in \nthe univariate setting and in the multivariable model [P-value = 0.009 and \n0.021, respectively; HR: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55-0.95)]. IDO-1 positivity in immune \ncells was found to be significantly associated with OS in the univariate setting \nand was borderline significant in the multivariable model [P-value = 0.006 and \n0.053; HR: 0.798 (95% CI: 0.635-1.003)].\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest a prognostic role of IDO-1 protein expression in \nNSCLC tumor and immune cells independent of EGFR, KRAS AND PD-L1 expression, and \nshould be explored as a predictive biomarker in clinical studies with IDO-1 \ntargeted therapies."}

Historically, KRAS had been a very difficult target \ndue to its strong binding to GDP/GTP and the lack of available druggable binding \npockets. Considerable advances have been achieved in generating direct \nsmall-molecule inhibitors selectively targeting KRAS G12 mutations.

Structure-guided drug design improved \nthe basis for understanding the mutations in KRAS, notably at codon 12, and the \nidea has potential for gene therapy.

Standard diet syngeneic C57BL/6 mice of the same age were used for \nthe control group. The drug-treated groups received high-dose and low-dose XFZY \nvia continuous intragastric administration in atherosclerotic mice. The \nconcentrations of the inflammatory factors were measured. The lipid deposition, \npathological changes and collagen expression in the thoracic aorta wall were \ndetected. The levels of expression of CD36, ABCA1, SR-A1, and ABCG1 were \nquantified within the thoracic aorta tissue.\nRESULTS: In the XFZY-treated group, a notable decline was observed in serum \nlipid levels, as well as in the concentrations of inflammatory factors. This \nreduction was accompanied by a decrease in the accumulation of lipids within the \nwall of the thoracic aorta. The XFZY treatment leaded in a decrease in the \nexpression value of collagen I and III within the thoracic aorta. Pathological \nexamination of the thoracic aorta indicated alleviation of atherosclerotic \nlesions. Intriguingly, The study observed a downregulation of SR-A1 and CD36 \nexpression, accompanied by an upregulation of ABCG1 and ABCA1 in \natherosclerosis-induced mice models.\nCONCLUSION: XFZY exerts an anti-atherosclerotic effect not only by reducing \nserum lipid and inflammatory levels but also by decreasing thoracic aortic lipid \ndeposition, repairing endothelial injury, and stabilizing atherosclerotic \nplaques.

By integrating genomic data from the Gene \nExpression Omnibus (GEO) with human atherosclerotic tissues, we identified \nenrichment of sumoylation pathways in AS, with chromobox 4 (CBX4), a SUMO E3 \nligase, being significantly upregulated. This study aims to investigate the role \nof CBX4 in macrophages during atherosclerosis progression and its potential \nmolecular mechanisms.\nMETHODS: We analyzed gene expression profiles from human atherosclerotic \nsegments to identify differentially expressed pathways. High-fat diet \n(HFD)-challenged apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice were used to examine \nCBX4 expression in macrophages. The impact of CBX4 on atherosclerosis was \nassessed using macrophage-specific CBX4 knockdown and overexpression models. \nMechanistically, we evaluated the interaction between CBX4 and hypoxia-inducible \nfactor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and its effect on sumoylation and transcriptional \nactivity.\nRESULTS: CBX4 expression was elevated in macrophages from atherosclerotic \nlesions of HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice. Macrophage-specific CBX4 knockdown \nsignificantly alleviated HFD-induced AS, whereas CBX4 overexpression exacerbated \natherosclerotic progression. Mechanistically, CBX4 directly interacted with \nHIF-1\u03b1 and promoted its sumoylation, leading to increased HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional \nactivity, which may contribute to AS development.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight CBX4-promoted SUMOylation of HIF-1\u03b1 \nexacerbates AS progression. Targeting CBX4 may represent a promising therapeutic \nstrategy for mitigating atherosclerosis progression."}

In particular, the TIGIT.2 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell \nsubset manifests a more pronounced exhaustion score relative to TIGIT.1 \u03b3\u03b4 T \ncell subset, indicating differential levels of cellular exhaustion among these \ngroups. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between high expression \nof TIGIT \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets and poorer patient prognoses. We also discovered \nunique expression profiles within these subgroups: TIGIT.1 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are marked \nby elevated CXCR4 expression, contrasting with the TIGIT.2 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subgroup \nwhich exhibits increased CX3CR1 expression. Pseudotime analysis implies a \npotential differentiation trajectory from na\u00efve and GZMK \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to various \nterminally differentiated subsets, with genes associated with stemness (e.g., \nTCF-1) subsequently downregulated. These findings suggest that TIGIT.2 subset \nmay be further along in the differentiation trajectory, potentially representing \na more terminally differentiated state than TIGIT.1 subset. According to our \nclinical validation cohort, the TIGIT+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset is highly expressed in \npatients and correlates with poor prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: We identified genetic subtypes of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with distinct genotypic \nand clinical characteristics in DLBCL patients. Expression levels within these \nsubgroups emerged as potential indicators for patient outcomes and as crucial \nfactors in shaping therapeutic strategies. These insights significantly advance \nour understanding of intricate relationships among cellular subgroups and their \nroles in influencing disease progression and patient prognosis."}

Before and after the RT, \ncirculating stress biomarkers (calcium, inorganic phosphate, creatine kinase \n[CK], total antioxidant capacity [TAC]), inflammation (tumour necrosis \nfactor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1]), interleukin 10 (IL-10), vascular endothelial growth \nfactor and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were analyzed by immunology multiplex \nassay and ELISA. Moreover, maximal strength to back squat (1RM-SQ) and squat \njump (SJ) performance were measured.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that, compared with N, the HH group exhibited a \nlarge increase in 1RM-SQ and SJ (all ES\u2009>\u20090.99; p\u2009<\u20090.041) outcomes.

The effects of WCF on tumor migration and invasion were evaluated. \nSpecific markers of macrophage polarization, non-targeted metabolomics, lipid \ncontent, and the PPAR-\u03b3/CD36 pathway in macrophages were analyzed. To \ninvestigate the in vivo effects of WCF on metastasis, a mouse model was \nestablished using LLC-luciferase (LLC-Luc) cells, macrophages were depleted upon \nclodronate liposome administration.\nRESULTS: WCF effectively inhibited M2-like polarization of macrophages, as \nevidenced by reduced expression of CD206 and Arg-1, while promoting M1-like \npolarization, with increased expression of CD86, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. These changes \nwere correlated with decreased migration and invasion of LLC cells. In vivo, WCF \ntreatment significantly decreased the fluorescence intensity of LLC-Luc cells, \nwith no significant difference observed between WCF and clodronate liposome \ninterventions.

The extent of gastric mucosal injury was evaluated \nusing ulcer index (UI) and histopathological examinations. Additionally, the \nlevels of inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor \nnecrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were determined using \nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) \nand network pharmacology were used to explore the potential mechanisms \nunderlying the therapeutic effects of JWYY in the treatment of GU. Changes in \npotential hub genes and pathways related to the therapeutic effects of JWYY were \nassessed using western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence analyses. The \nprotective effects of potential active ingredients were evaluated in vitro \nmodels.\nRESULTS: The administration of JWYY significantly decrease the UI and alleviated \ngastric hemorrhagic necrosis, submucosal edema, and destruction of epithelial \ncells in mouse model of GU. JWYY markedly suppressed IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MDA \nlevels, and restored mucosal integrity (ZO-1 expression). RNA-seq revealed dual \nroles of JWYY, including the inhibition of JAK2-STAT3/NF-\u03baB pathways to \nattenuate inflammation and the rescue of activation of PI3K-AKT/DNA repair \npathways to enhance cell survival. Network pharmacology and UPLC-MS/MS \nidentified quercetin, morin, naringenin, catechin as key bioactive components, \nwhich bind to JAK2/PDGFRA, decreased inflammation, reduced oxidative stress, and \ninhibited apoptosis in vitro.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study deciphers the multi-target, multi-pathway mechanisms \nunderline the JWYY in the treatment of alcohol-induced GU, integrating TCM \nprinciples with modern pharmacology. The identified bioactive components and \npathways provide a scientific foundation for clinical usage of JWYY and \nindicated the important of targeting JAK-STAT/NF-\u03baB signaling in the treatment \nof GU. These bioactive components not only explain the mechanism of complex TCM \nformulations but also can be used to improve the therapeutic efficacy."}

Identifying therapeutic targets and drugs \nfor this disease is of critical urgency. However, traditional drug discovery \noften overlooks cell communication signals. Here, our single-cell omics data and \nin vivo experiments of the murine coal pneumoconiosis model revealed that a \nsubpopulation of neutrophils with high expression of S100a8 enhanced the \ncommunication between neutrophils and macrophages. Based on these findings, we \nhypothesized that inhibiting S100a8 could mitigate coal dust-induced pulmonary \nfibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we employed Paquinimod, an S100a8 inhibitor. \nOur data demonstrated that Paquinimod alleviated coal dust-induced pulmonary \nfibrosis by blocking the neutrophil-S100a8-Tlr4-macrophage signaling axis, \nsuppressing the Tlr4/p38MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway, lowering phosphorylation levels of \np38MAPK and NF-\u03baB p65.

Dunal (WS) as a chemoprophylactic and immunomodulatory agent against \nSARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMETHODS: In a 12 week, randomized, open label, parallel group, two arm, \ncomparative, multicentric, controlled trial compared WS with hydroxychloroquine \n(HCQ) in health care workers (HCWs). Total 400 HCWs were randomized in 1:1 ratio \nto receive either oral WS (500\u00a0mg for 12 weeks) or HCQ 400\u00a0mg (for 7 weeks). The \nprimary outcome was to establish equivalence between WS and HCQ for the \nproportion of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nRESULTS: Seven participants contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection: 5 in WS arm and 2 \nin HCQ arm. The equivalence between WS and HCQ was established for the \nproportion difference of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection for \nper-protocol (PP) (1.6%, 95% CI: -1.08%-4.33%) and in subgroup analysis (ITT, \nmIIT, non-vaccinated and seronegative). Notably, the immunomodulatory effect of \nWS stood scientifically validated by the statistically significant difference in \ncytokine levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) at 12 weeks compared to baseline for Tumor Necrosis \nFactor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17 and Monocyte \nchemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were most \nfrequent (53 in WS and 58 in HCQ). Headache and sneezing were observed only with \nHCQ. Participant global assessment showed excellent tolerability with both \ntreatment arms.\nCONCLUSION: WS was found equivalent to HCQ as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection with no safety concern. WS is thus inferred to be an effective and \nsafe Ayurvedic intervention for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and \nalso as an immunobooster."}

Our previous preliminary study showed that anthocyanin-rich \nextract (ACNE) from Xinjiang wild cherry plum (Prunus divaricata Ledeb) fruit \npeels exhibited anti-atherosclerotic effect. However, the potential mechanism of \nthis health-beneficial effect remains unclear. Here, network pharmacology \ncombined with molecular docking was used to tentatively address this issue. The \nACNE mainly contains cyanidin, cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy3Glu), Cyanidin \n3-(6''-acetylglucoside) (Cy3AcGlu), cyanidin 3-galactoside (Cy3Gal), cyanidin \n3-xyloside (Cy3Xyl), and cyanidin 3-rutinoside (Cy3Rut). Seven key targets, \nEGFR, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, SRC, HIF1A, CXCR4 and IGF1R were identified from core \nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Anthocyanins interacting on key \ntargets were initially demonstrated by molecular docking, particularly Cy3Rut \nand Cy3Xyl having highest affinity with most key targets. Biological function \nanalysis suggested that key targets were involved in several biological \nprocesses, including positive regulation of cell migration, positive regulation \nof phosphorylation, inflammatory response, response to hypoxia, etc. The \nsignificantly enriched pathways, such as HIF-1 signaling pathway, calcium \nsignaling pathway, macrophage stimulating protein MSP signaling network map, \nwere closely related to atherosclerosis. Altogether, based on the comprehensive \nanalysis and discussion, we revealed that TLR4/EGFR and IGF1R-CXCL12/CXCR4 \npathways were at least partially implicated in the anti-atherosclerotic effects \nof anthocyanins through affecting inflammation, endothelial homeostasis, and \nfoam cell formation. This study served as a theoretical basis for further \nvalidating the underlying anti-atherosclerotic mechanism of anthocyanins via in \nvitro and in vivo experiments."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "VEGFA", "text": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and aggressive malignancy that \nfrequently metastasizes to the liver, presenting significant therapeutic \nchallenges. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying CRC liver \nmetastasis and resistance to immune therapy remain poorly understood. In this \nstudy, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving CRC metastasis \nusing a novel approach, which includes the establishment of highly metastatic \nCRC cell lines.\nMETHODS: To explore the role of specific genes in CRC liver metastasis, we \ndeveloped two highly metastatic CRC cell lines (LoVo-Hm and HCT116-Hm) by \napplying sustained selective pressure to primary CRC cells. RNA sequencing was \nperformed to identify differentially expressed genes in these metastatic cells. \nAdditionally, we conducted assays for cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, \nand ELISA to evaluate VEGFA production, all to confirm the functional role of \nSLC9A2. Our findings were further validated in human CRC tissue samples and \npublicly available datasets to assess the clinical relevance of the identified \ntargets.\nRESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant downregulation of SLC9A2 in the \nhighly metastatic CRC cell lines. Mechanistically, we found that SLC9A2 inhibits \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by suppressing the STAT3 \nsignaling pathway. Moreover, SLC9A2 reduces VEGFA secretion, normalizing tumor \nvasculature and reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME), which ultimately \nenhances anti-tumor immunity. Comparative analysis of CRC tissue samples showed \nreduced SLC9A2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, \nwith a negative correlation to TNM staging. Importantly, higher SLC9A2 \nexpression was associated with better treatment responses in immunotherapy \ncohorts.\nCONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical role of SLC9A2 in regulating \nmetastasis, angiogenesis, and TME remodeling in CRC. By modulating the STAT3 \npathway and tumor vasculature, SLC9A2 emerges as a potential prognostic \nbiomarker and therapeutic target. Targeting SLC9A2 may enhance immune responses \nand improve treatment outcomes in CRC, offering a promising avenue for future \ntherapeutic strategies."}

In this study, we analyzed the targets of action and signaling pathways of \ngentiopicroside (GEN) in RA using network pharmacology and validated them \nthrough molecular docking and experimental approaches. A collagen-induced \narthritis (CIA) rat model was employed to analyze the role of GEN in influencing \nRA joint pathology and related angiogenic factors. Additionally, cellular \nexperiments were conducted to assess the proliferation, migration, and tubular \nstructure formation ability of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Western \nblotting was used to detect the protein expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4. Network \npharmacological analyses revealed that GEN exerts multiple effects on RA therapy \nby modulating multiple pathways. Combined with literature analysis and molecular \ndocking data modeling, GEN was found to intervene in RA by regulating CXCL12 and \nCXCR4. In CIA rats, GEN inhibited the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, CXCL12, VEGF-A, and \nAng-2, and attenuated the pathology associated with aberrant neovascularization \nin the knee joint. Cellular experiments confirmed that GEN could inhibit the \nproliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation ability of EPCs \ninduced by high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and could inhibit the formation of \nabnormal neovascularization by interfering with CXCL12 and CXCR4.

Infants with gestational ages (GA) of 32-37 weeks and birth weights \n(BW) >1500\u2009g who required ROP treatment were included. Patient demographics, \nclinical details, treatments, responses and complications were recorded. \nDescriptive statistics were calculated after excluding cases with missing or \nerroneous data.\nRESULTS: The study included 365 eyes of 365 infants. The average GA at birth was \n33\u00b11 weeks, with a mean BW of 1896\u00b1316\u2009g. Of these, 83.6% had type 1 ROP, and \n16.4% had aggressive ROP (A-ROP). Treatment-requiring ROP (TR-ROP) occurred at \nan average postmenstrual age of 39.0\u00b14.6 weeks. Among 170 infants with TR-ROP at \ntheir first exam, 81.2% were screened at 4\u2009weeks postpartum. Reactivation of ROP \nwas observed in 5.4% of the primary laser photocoagulation (LPC) group and 23.9% \nof the primary anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) group (p<0.001). \nReactivation and progression to stage 4-5 were more frequent in A-ROP cases \n(p=0.012; p=0.008). The need for additional treatment was significantly higher \nin cases of A-ROP, zone 1 disease or stage 4-5 disease (p<0.001). Anti-VEGF \ntherapy demonstrated superior single-treatment success rates in A-ROP eyes \ncompared with laser LPC (85.7% vs 60%, p=0.03). Infants requiring additional \ntreatments also had higher rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), \nmaternal premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and non-ophthalmological surgical \ninterventions (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Bigger premature infants in low and middle-income countries should \nbe screened earlier than 4\u2009weeks after birth. A-ROP, zone 1 disease and stage \n4-5 disease have higher reactivation risks. Primary anti-VEGF therapy was \nassociated with a greater need for retreatment. Maternal PROM, RDS and surgical \ninterventions also increase retreatment risk. Limitations include retrospective \ndesign and lack of smaller preterm comparisons, potentially limiting \ngeneralisability."}

The MRTKI \nRegorafenib is currently assessed in the relapse setting in patients with RMS \n(NCT04625907). Reliable biomarkers of response for MRTKIs are lacking. MRTKIs \nact not only against the cancer cell, but also the supporting stroma, \nparticularly the vasculature. The embryonic zebrafish is translucent and allows \nassessment of this interaction with high-throughput in vivo imaging.\nMETHODS: A new preclinical embryo zebrafish xenograft model was developed using \nTg(flk1:GFP) (blood vessel reporter) transgenic zebrafish embryos inoculated in \nthe yolk with fluorescently labelled cells from 7 different RMS cell lines \n(fusion-positive (FP): Rh4, Rh30, Rh41, RMS-01, fusion-negative (FN): RD, JR1, \nSMS-CTR), and patient-derived cells IC-pPDX-104 at 50 hours post-fertilization \nand incubated at 34\u00b0C for up to 70 hours. Xenografts and vessel beds were imaged \nand analysed using custom FIJI pipelines. MRTKIs regorafenib and infigratinib \nwere used at a concentration of 0.1uM added to the fish water 4 hours post cell \ninoculation. Pro-angiogenic growth factors VEFG-A, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB were \nmeasured in conditioned media of each cell line.\nRESULTS: All 7 RMS cell lines and the patient-derived cells engrafted with \ntumour burden assessment by fluorescent imaging and direct cell counting \nindicating adequate growth and high cell viability during the observation \nperiod. RMS tumours induced neo-vascularisation towards the tumour and increased \ndensity of proximal vessel beds. MRTKI treatment revealed a greater \ntumour-intrinsic sensitivity of FP cells, but identified a significant blockade \nof neo-vascularisation across all RMS lines, with regorafenib response \ncorrelated with secretion of VEGF-A.\nCONCLUSION: We have developed an embryonic zebrafish xenograft model of RMS, \nwhich allows assessment of tumour growth, vascularisation initiation and \ntherapeutic responses to clinically relevant MRTKIs. The identification of \nVEGF-A secretion as potential biomarker for Regorafenib response and the \nseparation of therapeutic effects on tumour growth and neovascularisation \nsuggests additional value of our model for response prediction to MRTKIs."}

Many researchers have previously reported that natural compounds from \nplants or Chinese Traditional Herbs have a potential to treat NSCLC. But it has \nnot been reported that phytol can treat NSCLC. In this research, we first \nexposed this effect on A549 cells and researched the mechanism.\nMETHODS: In order to evaluate whether phytol has a role in human NSCLC, a human \nnon-tumoral bronchial epithelial cell line (NL20), adenocarcinomic human \nalveolar basal epithelial (A549) cell line, and NCI-H69 SCLC (H69) cell line \nwere used for related experiments. After determining that phytol had no toxicity \nto NL20 cells, A549 cells, or H69 cells, the inhibitory effect of phytol on \ncancer cell related characteristics of cells were determined by luciferase \nassay, QRT-PCR, proliferation, invasion, and would healing cellular response \nexperiments. Additionally, the quantification of apoptotic cells has been \nachieved through flow cytometry. Then, bioinformatics was used to establish a \ndatabase to screen and speculate on phytol's corresponding targets in lung \ncancer. Finally, immunoblotting experiments were used to determine the specific \npathways affected by phytol.\nRESULTS: Treatment with phytol at concentrations ranging from 0 to 80\u2009\u00b5M for \n24\u2009hours was not cytotoxic to the A549 cells and H69 cells. Phytol inhibited \nAP-1-mediated and NF-\u03baB-mediated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner \nin A549 cells, but not H69 cells. Additionally, phytol significantly inhibited \nthe levels of MMP9, IL-6, VEGFA, IL-8, and NFKBIA in A549 cells, but had no \nsignificant effects on H69 cells. Phytol induced significant dose-dependent \ngrowth inhibitory effects on A549 cells. A significant decrease in colony \nformation and migration was observed. Bioinformatic and immunoblotting analysis \nindicated that phytol inhibited proliferation and migration of A549 cells \nthrough the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.\nCONCLUSIONS: Phytol exhibits anticancer activity by inhibiting PI3K-Akt \nsignaling pathway and may be applicable in the clinical prevention and treatment \nof lung cancer in the future."}

The \nmulticenter observational PROMISE study (NCT04038047) found that calprotectin \ndecreased in PwCF treated with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). To better \nunderstand the dynamics between fecal dysbiosis and GI inflammation, we \ncharacterized the microbiomes of fecal samples from PROMISE and the \nrelationships with calprotectin before, 1-month post, and 6-months post ETI.\nMETHODS: Fecal microbiota from participants \u226512 y/o were determined by shotgun \nmetagenomic sequencing with random forest modeling and multivariate linear \nregression analysis to define relationships between microbiota, calprotectin, \nand deltaF508 genotype before and after ETI.\nRESULTS: We analyzed 345 samples from 124 participants. At baseline, we observed \ncommunity-level differences in the fecal microbiota among participants with \nabnormal compared to normal calprotectin. With ETI, the relative abundances of 7 \nbacterial species - Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium \nscindens, Enterocloster clostridioformis, Clostridium butyricum, Anaeroglobus \ngeminatus, and Ruminococcus gnavus - decreased significantly, correlating with \ncalprotectin decrease. We detected community-level differences in the fecal \nmicrobiota based on CFTR genotype and a distinct pattern of microbiota change in \nF508del homozygous compared to heterozygous participants after ETI.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified 7 species for which fecal abundances decreased with \nETI and correlated with calprotectin decrease, supporting a close relationship \nbetween fecal microbiota and inflammation in PwCF.

We aimed to focus on the evolution of \nhepatobiliary involvement following lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LI) and \nelexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) initiation.\nMETHODS: A retrospective monocentric observational study included 62 CF children \ntreated with CFTR modulators. Data were collected at initiation and after one \nyear of treatment. The primary objective was to describe the evolution of \nhepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulator treatment.\nRESULTS: We identified hepatobiliary involvement before treatment in 37 patients \n(59.7 %). Fifteen had persistently (during >6 months) elevated liver enzymes \n(mostly ALT); 17 had abnormal ultrasound including 3 with nodular liver and 3 \nwith pathological elastography; 5 had isolated splenomegaly. Biliary involvement \nwas found in 19 patients. The evolution of hepatic parameters in the overall \npopulation was not significant (p > 0.05). However, we observed a trend towards \nimprovement in laboratory values under treatment. There was only one inaugural \ndiagnosis of nodular liver under LI and none under ETI. All patients had \npreserved liver function (PT>50 %).\nCONCLUSIONS: We did not find a significant improvement or worsening of \nhepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulators. We hypothesize that it could be \nstabilized with these treatments, but this will need confirmation through \nfurther studies with longer follow-up and larger cohorts. The other hypothesis \nproposed is that biological monitoring may not be an accurate assessment of the \nhepatobiliary response to modulators. This study supports the safety of CFTR \nmodulator use."}

In Asian \npopulations, both the spectrum of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance \nregulator (CFTR) gene mutations and the clinical course differ from those \nobserved in Western populations. Although the recognition of CF is increasing in \nSouth Asia, comprehensive data from Southeast Asian countries remain sparse. The \nunderdiagnosis of CF in Southeast Asia is attributed to limited awareness among \nhealthcare professionals and restricted access to sweat chloride testing. Until \n2021, CF had not been documented in the indigenous population of Vietnam. This \nstudy presents the first three confirmed cases of CF in native Vietnamese \nindividuals. Additionally, a literature review of CF cases reported across \nSoutheast Asia was conducted to provide insights into its prevalence and \nvariations in CFTR mutation profiles within the region. A total of 50 cases were \nidentified, distributed across Malaysia (30 cases), Thailand (8), the \nPhilippines (6), Vietnam (5), and Indonesia (1), revealing a mutation spectrum \ndistinct from that observed in Caucasian populations. The most common mutations \nincluded p.Phe508del and p.Ile1295PhefsX32, each found in 11.5% of cases.

Children completing \nthis study could enroll into a 192-week extension study.\nOBJECTIVES: Evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children \u22656 \nyears.\nMETHODS: In this 2-part (Part A [96-weeks] and Part B [96-weeks]) phase 3 \nextension study, children <12 years weighing <30 kg received ELX 100 mg once \ndaily (qd)/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg every 12 hours (q12h) and children weighing \u2265 \n30 kg or aged \u226512 years received ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-four children (F/MF [n=36] and F/F [n=28]) \nreceived \u2265 1 dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA. Mean exposure was 156.2 weeks and 60.9% of \nchildren (n=39) completed treatment in both parts of this 192-week study. The \nprimary endpoint was safety. All children had adverse events (AEs), which for \nmost were mild (31.3%) or moderate (64.1%) and generally consistent with common \nmanifestations of CF. Two children (3.1%) had non-serious AEs that lead to \ntreatment discontinuation (increased alanine aminotransferase [n=1] and \naggression [n=1]). Secondary endpoints focused on efficacy. From parent study \nbaseline, improvements were seen in ppFEV1 (9.6 percentage points; 95% CI: 5.4, \n13.7), sweat chloride concentration (-57.9 mmol/L; 95% CI: -63.3, -52.5), CFQ-R \nrespiratory domain score (10.0 points; 95% CI: 6.9, 13.0), LCI2.5 (-2.33; 95% \nCI: -2.87, -1.79), and BMI z-score (0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.59) at Week 192. Rate \nof pulmonary exacerbations per year was 0.05.

CFTR is expressed in \nimmune cells and regulates innate immunity, both directly and indirectly. The \nepithelial sodium channel (ENaC) contributes to dysfunction in CF airway \nepithelial cells. However, the impact of non-CFTR ion channel dysfunction on CF \nimmune responses is not understood. Improved understanding of how immune \nfunction is regulated by ion channels may allow antibiotic- and \nmutation-agnostic treatment approaches to chronic infection and inflammation. \nTherefore, we hypothesized that ENaC is aberrantly expressed in CF macrophages \nand directly contributes to impaired phagocytic and inflammatory functions. ENaC \nexpression was characterized in immune cells isolated from CF and non-CF blood \ndonors. Monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) function and bacterial killing was \ntested with ENaC modulation. Baseline ENaC expression in human CF MDMs, \nlymphocytes, and granulocytes was increased at both the transcript and protein \nlevel relative to non-CF and persisted after infection. CFTR inhibition in \nnon-CF MDMs resulted in ENaC overexpression. CFTR modulator treatment reduced \nbut did not eliminate ENaC overexpression in CF MDMs. Interestingly, ENaC \ninhibition increased CFTR expression. Amiloride-treated CF MDMs also showed \nnormalized ROS production, improved autophagy, and decreased pro-inflammatory \ncytokine production. Sodium channel expression in CF MDMs normalized after \nAmiloride treatment with minimal effect on other ion channels. In summary, ENaC \nmodulation in immune cells is a novel potential therapeutic target for CF \ninfection control, either in combination with CFTR modulators, or as a sole \nagent for people not eligible for CFTR modulators."}

The biochemical features of \nendometriosis focus on the folic acid and one-carbon cycle. Endometriosis cannot \nbe diagnosed by a blood test. An important enzyme in the folate cycle is \nmethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). There are a number of variants in \nthe MTHFR gene, but the C677T polymorphism has received the most attention and \nis associated with a number of diseases and problems.\nPURPOSE: To investigate the association between MTHFR (C677T) and MTR (A2756G) \ngene polymorphisms and the pathogenesis of endometriosis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 endometriosis cases and 51 healthy \nvolunteers were genotyped for MTHFR (C677T) and MTR (A2756G) gene polymorphisms. \nGenotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment \nlength polymorphism. The frequency of genotypes was analyzed by the Chi-square \ntest and odds ratio for relative risk.\nRESULTS: The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT genotypes of MTHFR C677T were 17.65%, \n54.90%, and 27.45% in cases and 64.71%, 15.69%, and 19.61% in controls, \nrespectively.

It highlights recent findings on diagnostic \nmethods, pathophysiological mechanisms, and health implications associated with \nNWO.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Individuals with NWO have an increased risk of developing \nchronic inflammation, cardiometabolic disorders, insulin resistance, and \nsarcopenia. Genetic factors, including polymorphisms in IL-6, IL-1Ra, IL-15Ra, \nand MTHFR genes, play a significant role in determining susceptibility. \nLifestyle behaviors, reduced physical activity and frequent intake of \nultra-processed foods, further elevate metabolic risks. Advanced diagnostic \ntechniques, particularly Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), are essential \nfor accurate identification of NWO, as traditional BMI measurements fail to \nadequately detect this phenotype. Recognition and management of NWO require \nshifting from BMI-based classifications to detailed body composition analyses. \nIncorporating DXA into clinical practice is essential for accurately identifying \nindividuals at metabolic risk. Further research should develop targeted \nstrategies for preventing and treating this specific obesity phenotype."}

Neonatal onset is typically \ncharacterized by postnatal microcephaly, developmental delays, feeding \ndifficulties, growth deficiency, seizures, intellectual disability, neonatal \napneas, motor and gait abnormalities, psychiatric manifestations, a history of \nstroke, and progressive neurologic deterioration. Individuals with adolescent or \nadult onset may present with milder clinical manifestations, which may include \nthromboembolic events, lens dislocation, and less commonly cognitive decline, \npsychiatric manifestations, seizures, and/or motor and gait abnormalities.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of homocystinuria due to deficiency of \nN(5,10)-MTHFR activity is established in a proband with characteristic clinical \nand laboratory findings (low plasma methionine, increased plasma and urine \nhomocysteine, low plasma and CSF 5-methyltetrahydrofolate [MTHF]) and biallelic \npathogenic variants in MTHFR identified by molecular genetic testing.\nMANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Betaine, methionine, vitamin B12, and L-5-MTHF can \nreduce risk of neurologic manifestations and increase life span. Supportive \ncare: Respiratory support as needed; sleep study for those with suspected apnea \nand respiratory compromise; feeding therapy as needed; standard treatment for \nseizures by neurologist; developmental and educational support; treatment of \nmotor and gait abnormalities per orthopedist, physical medicine and \nrehabilitation specialist, and physical and occupational therapists; treatment \nfor neurovascular manifestations to prevent stroke; social work and family \nsupport. Surveillance: Plasma homocysteine and plasma amino acids to assess \nmethionine concentration every three to four months; assess for respiratory \nissues annually or as needed; assess growth, nutrition, oral intake, seizures, \nchanges in tone, movement disorders, and family needs at each visit; behavioral \nassessment annually or as needed; assessment of motor and gait abnormalities at \neach visit; neurovascular assessment annually or as needed. Agents/circumstances \nto avoid: High-protein diet; medications impacting folate metabolism (e.g., \nmethotrexate); certain anti-seizure medications (e.g., valproic acid) that may \nincrease homocysteine levels; inadequate monitoring of vitamin levels. \nEvaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs is warranted to \nallow early detection and timely intervention. If prenatal testing has not been \nperformed, a newborn with an older sib with homocystinuria due to deficiency of \nN(5,10)-MTHFR activity should receive immediate nutritional and metabolic \nmanagement pending results of biochemical testing (e.g., plasma homocysteine and \nmethionine concentration) and/or molecular genetic testing for the familial \nMTHFR pathogenic variants.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: Homocystinuria due to deficiency of N(5,10)-MTHFR activity \nis inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be \nheterozygous for an MTHFR pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual \nhas at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an \nasymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. \nOnce the MTHFR pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family \nmember, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation \ngenetic testing are possible."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "MTHFR", "text": "Background: Childhood cancers represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies \nand remain one of the leading causes of mortality among children under 14 years \nof age, ranking second only to accidental injuries, and fourth among individuals \naged 15 to 19 years. Despite notable improvements in cure rates, a substantial \nproportion of patients experience acute or long-term toxicities associated with \ntreatment. Methotrexate (MTX), a chemotherapeutic agent, has been employed \neffectively for over six decades in the management of pediatric malignancies. \nHigh-dose methotrexate constitutes a cornerstone of pediatric cancer therapy; \nhowever, its clinical utility is frequently constrained by dose-limiting \ntoxicities. Objectives: This study investigates the impact of genetic \npolymorphisms in genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, as well as \nmethotrexate and folate metabolic pathways, on treatment-related toxicity in \nchildhood cancer. Methods: Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, 14 \npolymorphisms across 12 genes were analyzed in a cohort of 107 patients. \nToxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \nEvents v. 5.0. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that \nthe male sex (p = 0.3) and the AA genotype of MTHFD1 rs2236225 were associated \nwith grade III-IV gastrointestinal toxicity (p = 0.03), while the A allele of \nMTHFR rs1801133 and the AA genotype of GSTP1 rs1695 were associated with grade \nI-IV hematologic toxicity (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: \nHigh-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is a critical agent in the treatment of childhood \ncancers. Our findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms within methotrexate and \nfolate metabolic pathways may serve as potential predictive biomarkers of \ntreatment-related toxicity."}

These features suggest disrupted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \ndynamics and folate metabolism. With L-DOPA treatment showing diminishing \nbenefits over time, there is an urgent need to investigate upstream metabolic \ndisruptions, including folate and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathways, in \npost-mortem CSF and brain tissue to understand their roles in PD pathogenesis. \nMethods: CSF and brain tissue from 20 PD patients (mean age 84 years; 55% male; \ndisease duration 10-30 years) and 20 controls (mean age 82 years; 50% male) were \nanalysed. Western and Dot Blots measured proteins and metabolites, spectroscopic \nassays assessed enzyme activities, BH4 and Neopterin levels were measured using \nELISA, and levels of hydrogen peroxide, used as a proxy for reactive oxygen \nspecies, and calcium were quantified using horseradish peroxidase and flame \nphotometry assays, respectively. ClinVar genetic data were analysed for variants \nin genes encoding key enzymes. Statistical significance was assessed using \nunpaired t-tests (p < 0.05). Results: All enzymes were significantly reduced in \nPD compared to controls (p < 0.01) except for methyltetrahydrofolate reductase \n(MTHFR), which was elevated (p < 0.0001). Enzymes were functional in control but \nundetectable in PD CSF except tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). BH4 and Neopterin were \nelevated in PD CSF (p < 0.0001, p < 0.001) but significantly reduced (p < 0.001) \nor unchanged in tissue. Peroxide was increased in both PD CSF (p < 0.001) and \ntissue (p < 0.0001) selectively inhibiting TH. Calcium was 40% higher in PD than \ncontrols (p < 0.05). No pathogenic variants in enzyme genes were found in \nClinVar data searches, suggesting the observed deficiencies are physiological. \nConclusions: We identified significant disruptions in folate and BH4 pathways in \nPD, with enzyme deficiencies, oxidative stress and calcium dysregulation \npointing to choroid plexus dysfunction. These findings highlight the choroid \nplexus and CSF as key players in cerebral metabolism and promote further \nexploration of these as therapeutic targets to address dopaminergic dysfunction \nand ventricular enlargement in PD."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "IL6", "text": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a complex disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The molecular \nand cellular mechanisms of the disease are unclear and their study is one of the \ngreatest challenges for the modern science. Since the lung is the biggest target \nfor SARS-CoV-2, the studies on cellular and molecular changes in this organ are \nessential to establish the pathogenesis of the disease. To date there is \nincreasing number of reports on the lung pathology of fatal COVID-19 and the \nresults are mainly obtained by autopsies of elderly patients, since this age \ngroup shows highest mortality. Little is known about the progression of the \ndisease in children and especially newborn and infants and, to our knowledge, \nthere are no reports on the lung features of fatal COVID-19 in this age group.\nMETHODS: In the present case study, we have investigated the lung morphological \nfeatures in 11-months old infant who has died as a result of complications from \nCOVID-19. Immunohistochemistry for immune cell markers and transmission electron \nmicroscopy for alveolocytes type II (ATII) are made.\nRESULTS: Immediate cause of the death was acute respiratory failure resulting \nfrom bilateral interstitial pneumonia and subsequent acute cardiovascular \nfailure. The histopathology shows lung edema, hyaline membranes, airway mucus \nplugging and interstitial inflammation. On cellular level we have observed a \nsubstantial increase in the number of ATII cells. ATII cells were marked with \ncytokeratin 19, TTF1 and napsin A. Transmission elec-tron microscopy reveals \nongoing apoptosis in these cells with a typical chromatin clustering and \ncondensation towards the inner nuclear membrane. Immunohisto-chemistry shows \nsignificant increase of CD68+ macro-phages in the alveoli, increase of IL-6 in \nimmune and stromal cells, moderate elevation of FOXP3+ and IL-17+ cells and \nexpression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in alveolar walls. Immune cell interactions \nare discussed in the sense of ongoing cytokine storm.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the complexity of COVID-19 lung affection, \ninvolving ATII cell hyperplasia, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and \nmacrophages increase. The findings provide an additional knowledge on the \npathophysiology of COVID-19 in the lung and can serve as a basis for \ninvestigation of molecular mechanisms of this disease."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "IL6", "text": "BACKGROUND: Understanding liver diseases is important worldwide due to their \nprevalence. Apart from liver disease arising from hepatitis C viral infection, \nmost chronic liver diseases currently have no cure. Several therapeutic \nalternatives, including some natural products, have been proposed to treat liver \ndiseases. The natural product Jatropha dioica has been reported to possess \nantioxidant activity and, by extension, could have hepatoprotective activity. \nAccordingly, our aim was to test the hypothesis that an extract of J. dioica is \nprotective against liver damage induced by valproic acid (VPA).\nMETHODS: Twelve male and twelve female Wistar rats were sorted into four groups: \ncontrol, non-toxicity, valproic acid control (VPA-C), and J. dioica + VPA \n(JdVPA). J. dioica (300 mg/kg, given orally) was used as treatment, followed by \na concomitant injection of VPA (500 mg/kg, i.p.) for the first 4 days to induce \nliver injury. To evaluate the severity of the injury, liver function tests were \nperformed. In addition, oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified, as well as \nmeasures of the expression of the genes Actb, Il6, and Nfkb1.\nRESULTS: The VPA-C group showed a significant increase in alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malondialdehyde \n(MDA), a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a reduction in glutathione \n(GSH) vs the control group. The JdVPA group showed a significant decrease in \nALT, AST, and MDA and an increase in GSH and SOD vs the VPA-C group. Gene \nexpression of Il6 and Nfkb1 did not show any statistically significant \ndifferences between study groups. Histologically, VPA presented an inflammatory \ninfiltrate, which decreased in the JdVPA group.\nCONCLUSION: The extract of J. dioica at the administered dose did not display \ntoxicity and was capable of ameliorating the liver injury generated by VPA in \nbiochemical and oxidative stress biomarkers, which suggests its potential \nhepatoprotective activity."}

Understanding its underlying \nmechanisms is crucial for developing effective interventions.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate whether keratinocyte necroptosis contributes to RIOM \npathogenesis and evaluate the effects of RIPK3/MLKL inhibition.\nMETHODS: A mouse model of RIOM was established with varying irradiation doses. \nTongue tissues were analyzed via histological staining, immunohistochemistry, \nand Western blot. In vitro, keratinocytes were irradiated and treated with RIPK3 \nor MLKL inhibitors. Subsequently, cell viability, necroptosis, and inflammatory \ncytokine expression were assessed using CCK-8, LDH release, Western blot, flow \ncytometry and RT-qPCR.\nRESULTS: In irradiated mouse tongues, p-RIPK3/RIPK3 and p-MLKL/MLKL ratios were \nsignificantly elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.01), accompanied by heightened expression levels \nof IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Similar findings were observed in keratinocytes, which, after \n12\u00a0Gy irradiation for 2.5 days, reduced cell viability (P\u2009<\u20090.001), enhanced \nnecroptotic marker expression (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and increased inflammatory cytokine \nlevels (P\u2009<\u20090.001).

This study investigated whether clinical features and cytokine levels in \nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) distinguish MPP from MPP complicated by PB \nand sought to identify risk factors for PB in children with MPP.\nMETHODS: A total of 128 children 3-14 years of age with MPP who underwent \nbronchoscopy at Jingmen Central Hospital, China, between 1 April 2023 and 31 \nMarch 2024 were enrolled. Patients were divided into a PB and a non-PB group \nbased on bronchoscopy findings. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, \nincluding BALF cytokine levels, were compared. A risk prediction nomogram for PB \nwas constructed and evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of 128 children with MPP, 40 (31%) had PB. Multivariate logistic \nregression analysis showed that clinically severe MPP (OR\u2009=\u20098.78; P\u2009=\u20090.002), \nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (OR\u2009=\u20092.78; P\u2009=\u20090.049) and \nelevated BALF interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR\u2009=\u20091.01; P\u2009<\u20090.001) were independent risk \nfactors for PB. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve \n(AUC) value for the combination of severe MPP, SIRS and IL-6 was 0.852 (95% \nconfidence interval, 0.77-0.93). A calibration curve showed good agreement \nbetween nomogram prediction and actual observations (P\u2009=\u20090.723). A decision \ncurve analysis indicated that the nomogram demonstrated good clinical \napplicability.\nCONCLUSION: Pronounced inflammatory responses and increased clinical severity of \nMPP are associated with PB. A nomogram that integrates clinical features and \nBALF IL-6 levels may be used for risk assessment and management of PB in MPP \nafter initial bronchoscopy."}

Rat models of early-stage-T2DM (ED) \n(n\u00a0=\u00a08) and late-stage-T2DM (LD) (n\u00a0=\u00a016) were induced by high-saturated fat \ndiet and high-saturated fat high-cholesterol diet plus \nstreptozotocin/nicotinamide injection, respectively.

In LD rats pathological outcomes included: \nharmful oxysterol profile, decreased antioxidant defenses, neuroinflammation, \nbrain IR, augmented glucose uptake and impaired cholinergic transmission. Si-RM \nconsumption ameliorates these key outcomes by reducing brain levels of \npro-oxidant oxysterols (25-OHC and 27-OHC) to levels of ED rats. Antioxidant \ndefenses, including SOD and arylesterase activity, were enhanced, and \ninflammatory markers, such as GFAP, IL6, and TNF\u03b1, were reduced compared to LD \nand ED counterparts. Notably, silicon restored brain insulin signaling, \nnormalized glucose uptake via GLUT3, and shifted to an acetylcholine-preserving \nprofile, significantly mitigating neurodegenerative risks.

However, the complex interactions and \nsignaling pathways between MM cells and BM stromal cells remain inadequately \ndefined. In this study, we employed an in vitro coculture model to investigate \nthese interactions. We found that coculturing MM cells with BM-derived HS5 \nstromal cells stimulated the secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA) and interleukin-6 \n(IL-6), and significantly increased the expression of CD44 and F-actin stress \nfibers polymerization in MM cells. Among the three hyaluronan synthase (HAS) \nisoforms, HAS3 mRNA expression was most significantly elevated in MM cells \nfollowing coculture with HS5. This coculture also resulted in upregulation of \nHAS3 and IL-6 mRNA in MM cells. Notably, MM cells in direct contact with HS5 \ncells exhibited higher proliferative capacity compared to those not in contact \nwith the stromal cells. Additionally, coculturing MM cells with HS5 led to the \nformation of membrane protrusions in MM cells, with CD44 enrichment observed at \nthese polarized regions. Further analysis revealed that Rac1 co-localizes with \nCD44 on MM cells within the coculture system, suggesting that Rac1 signaling \nplays a critical role in CD44-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements. Importantly, \nsilencing CD44 expression in MM cells reduced F-actin polymerization, as well as \nimpaired MM cell migration and adhesion to HS5. Our findings highlight the \ninvolvement of the HA/CD44/F-actin pathway in MM-BM migration and adhesion, \nsuggesting that CD44 may serve as a novel therapeutic target to disrupt the \nMM-BM microenvironment."}

Hypericum japonicum Thunb. (Tianjihuang), a traditional Chinese \nmedicine exhibits promising anticancer properties. This study aims to elucidate \nthe multi-target mechanisms of Tianjihuang in treating HCC using network \npharmacology and molecular docking techniques.\nMETHODS: The active components of Tianjihuang and their targets were retrieved \nfrom TCMSP, PubChem, and Swiss Target Prediction databases. HCC-related targets \nwere identified using GeneCard, OMIM, and TTD databases, and overlapping targets \nwere analyzed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed and \nanalyzed using Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis of key targets was \nperformed via GO and KEGG pathways. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed the clinical \nrelevance of core targets, and molecular docking evaluated the binding \naffinities between Tianjihuang components and key targets.\nRESULTS: Tianjihuang contained seven bioactive components targeting 207 genes, \nwith 77 overlapping HCC-related targets. PPI analysis identified key targets, \nincluding AKT1, STAT3, EGFR, and ESR1, which play pivotal roles in HCC \npathogenesis. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that Tianjihuang's anti-HCC effects \ninvolve multiple biological processes and pathways, such as cell proliferation, \napoptosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Molecular docking results showed high binding \naffinities of key components, such as quercetin and gallic acid, with core \ntargets supporting their potential therapeutic effects.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Tianjihuang exerts its anti-HCC effects \nthrough a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism. These \nfindings provide a scientific foundation for the clinical application of \nTianjihuang and highlight its potential as a complementary therapy for HCC."}

Furthermore, treatments with these therapeutic agents or \nknockdown of ESR1 mRNA also increase PML1 protein levels. Mechanistically, we \nshow that ER inhibition through fulvestrant treatment activates PI3K and MAPK \nsignaling, which enhance PML1 protein stability and synthesis. PML1 then drives \na feedforward loop by stimulating the expression of cytokine and growth factor \nmRNAs, including CCL5 and HBEGF , further amplifying PI3K and MAPK signaling. \nConsequently, in endocrine-resistant cells, endocrine therapies, while \ninactivating ER, paradoxically reinforce this loop through increased PI3K/MAPK \nactivation and PML1 protein accumulation, ultimately compromising therapeutic \nefficacy. Finally, we demonstrated that arsenic trioxide, an FDA-approved, \nPML-reducing drug, effectively disrupts this feedforward loop, offering a \npromising strategy for treating resistant metastatic breast cancer.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Endocrine resistance remains a major obstacle in \ntreating estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Our study \nidentifies PML1 as a central mediator of this resistance, revealing how it \nmaintains a self-reinforcing signaling network through PI3K and MAPK pathways by \nenhancing the production of cytokines and growth factors. The clinical \nsignificance of our findings is threefold: we establish PML1 as a biomarker for \ntherapy resistance, demonstrate its mechanistic role in treatment failure, and \nshow that FDA-approved arsenic trioxide can disrupt PML1-driven resistance. \nThese insights provide a direct path to clinical translation, as combining \narsenic trioxide with existing therapies could benefit patients with limited \ntreatment options."}

However, its molecular \nmechanisms in female infertility and ovarian damage remain poorly characterized. \nThis study employs an integrative computational framework to elucidate \nATBC-associated targets and pathways, with validation through genetic \nepidemiology and molecular docking.\nRESULTS: We identified 137 ovarian damage-related and 143 infertility-related \nATBC targets, refined to 19 and 30 hub genes respectively. Pathway analysis \nrevealed significant enrichment in apoptosis, oxidative stress response, and PI3 \nK-AKT signaling (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Transcriptomic validation showed differential \nexpression of 7/10 infertility-related and 9/10 ovarian damage-related hub \ngenes. Mendelian randomization implicated TLR4 as protective against infertility \n(OR\u2009=\u20090.76, 95% CI:0.62-0.99; P\u2009=\u20090.049).

Firstly, \nnetwork pharmacology was adopted to predict potential drug targets and molecular \npathways of AKI by utilizing the active ingredients in JHD. Secondly, molecular \ndocking was used to explore the affinity between the active ingredients of JHD \nand AKI targets. Thirdly, biochemical analysis and histopathology were performed \nto estimate JHD's impact on cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Finally, quantitative \nreal-time PCR, Western blot, lipid/immunofluorescence staining, and untargeted \nmetabolomics were performed to understand the underlying mechanisms in vivo.\nRESULTS: In silico analysis identified 184 active compounds and 394 targets of \nJHD.

This study aims to elucidate \nthe multi-target mechanisms of Tianjihuang in treating HCC using network \npharmacology and molecular docking techniques.\nMETHODS: The active components of Tianjihuang and their targets were retrieved \nfrom TCMSP, PubChem, and Swiss Target Prediction databases. HCC-related targets \nwere identified using GeneCard, OMIM, and TTD databases, and overlapping targets \nwere analyzed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed and \nanalyzed using Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis of key targets was \nperformed via GO and KEGG pathways. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed the clinical \nrelevance of core targets, and molecular docking evaluated the binding \naffinities between Tianjihuang components and key targets.\nRESULTS: Tianjihuang contained seven bioactive components targeting 207 genes, \nwith 77 overlapping HCC-related targets. PPI analysis identified key targets, \nincluding AKT1, STAT3, EGFR, and ESR1, which play pivotal roles in HCC \npathogenesis. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that Tianjihuang's anti-HCC effects \ninvolve multiple biological processes and pathways, such as cell proliferation, \napoptosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Molecular docking results showed high binding \naffinities of key components, such as quercetin and gallic acid, with core \ntargets supporting their potential therapeutic effects.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Tianjihuang exerts its anti-HCC effects \nthrough a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism. These \nfindings provide a scientific foundation for the clinical application of \nTianjihuang and highlight its potential as a complementary therapy for HCC."}

Gut microbiota analysis revealed that GMO increased \nmicrobial diversity and promoted the relative abundance of Bacteroidota, \nincluding Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides sp. \nHF162, and Bacteroides fragilis. Additionally, we observed a dose-dependent \neffect of GMO on growth and development, where higher doses resulted in greater \neffects. Overall, our results suggest that a high dose of GMO enhance growth \nperformance and alters gut microbiota composition in stunted mice."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "AKT1", "text": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive bone cancer with a poor prognosis, \nparticularly in cases involving metastasis. While doxorubicin (ADM) is effective \nfor OS treatment, its use is hindered by severe cardiotoxicity. This study aimed \nto investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADM-induced cardiac injury \nand develop a novel strategy to reduce its toxicity, focusing on \nexosome-mediated drug delivery. Network toxicology and molecular docking \ntechniques were used to identify the key molecular targets involved in \nADM-induced cardiac injury. A target database was constructed from public \ndatabases (ChEMBL, STITCH, Swiss Target Prediction, GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD), \nand Venn diagram analysis was performed to identify the shared targets between \nADM and cardiac injury-related genes. A regulatory network was constructed, \nfollowed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes \n(KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses to gain insights into the biological \nprocesses involved. Additionally, exosomes were isolated from human osteosarcoma \nMG-63 cells and loaded with ADM via electroporation. The therapeutic efficacy \nand toxicity of exosome-encapsulated ADM (HOC-Exos@ADM) were evaluated using in \nvitro and in vivo models. Network toxicology analysis identified 27 shared \ntargets between ADM and cardiac injury, including key genes such as AKT1, TP53, \nESR1, and HIF1A. These genes are involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and \ninflammation, all of which contribute to cardiac damage. The exosome-mediated \ndelivery improved drug uptake, increased apoptosis in OS cells. In AKT1 \nsignaling, decreased AKT1 led to cardiomyocyte damage via GSK - 3\u03b2 and mTOR \npathways. Meanwhile, exhibited a safer profile in animal models. These results \nsuggest that exosome-based delivery can reduce ADM-induced cardiotoxicity and \nenhance clinical outcomes for patients with OS."}

Despite the availability of anticoagulants and \nthrombolytic agents, their clinical use is often limited by adverse effects. \nGinkgo biloba extract (GbE), a traditional herbal medicine, has shown promise in \nalleviating thrombosis, but its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently \nunderstood. This study aimed to explore the antithrombotic effects and molecular \nmechanisms of GbE through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments.\nMETHODS: Online databases were utilized for identifying the GbE's active \ncomponents and target genes, accompanied by thrombosis-related targets. \nFunctional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia \nof Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were performed. A drug-active \ncomponent-target gene-signaling pathway network and a protein-protein \ninteraction (PPI) network were constructed to determine core target genes and \npathways. In vivo, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) model was established by \nligating the inferior vena cava in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin and \neosin staining was adopted for evaluating the vascular endothelial structure. \nThe levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), \nnitric oxide (NO), and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured, accompanied by the \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and \nprothrombin time (PT). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the \nPI3K/AKT pathway-related protein expression.\nRESULTS: GbE comprised 27 active components with 4727 target genes and 2462 \nthrombosis-related targets, with 974 shared targets, including AKT1, ALB, GAPDH, \nTNF, and IL6, enriched in PI3K-AKT and AGE-RAGE pathways. Molecular docking \nindicated strong binding of GbE's main components to core targets. In vivo, GbE \nsignificantly relieved vascular lesions of DVT rats; reduced thrombotic wet \nweight; increased NO, cGMP, and PGI2 levels; decreased FIB; and prolonged APTT, \nPT, and TT (P < 0.05). Additionally, Western blot highlighted the suppressed \np-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios in DVT rats.\nCONCLUSIONS: GbE alleviates thrombosis by increasing antithrombotic factors and \nreducing coagulation, potentially via downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling. \nFuture studies should focus on long-term clinical trials and broader animal \nmodels to further validate GbE's therapeutic potential and explore other \nmolecular mechanisms."}

The objective of this study was to identify \ndifferences in clinical characteristics and prognosis and to verify survival \nresults among early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC), conventional-onset gastric \ncancer (COGC), late-onset gastric cancer (LOGC), and within the adenocarcinoma \nof the esophagogastric junction (AEG) group.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective trend analysis was conducted on patients \ndiagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma between 2002 and 2021. Additionally, 3,940 \npatients who underwent radical gastrectomy between January 2009 and December \n2019 were included in a further analysis. The patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on their age: EOGC, COGC, and LOGC. The study compared the \nthree groups' demographic parameters, surgical details, pathological \ncharacteristics, and survival rates.\nRESULTS: From 2002 to 2021, there was a fluctuating decrease in the surgical \npopulation of EOGC from 18.0% to 9.4% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). 3940 patients were included \nin this analysis, EOGC (n\u2009=\u2009572), COGC (n\u2009=\u20092816), and LOGC (n\u2009=\u2009552). The EOGC \ngroup indicated a higher proportion of females (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), poorer \ndifferentiation p\u2009<\u20090.0001), higher proportion of signet-ring cell cancer (SRCC) \n(p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and lower Her-2 expression (p\u2009=\u20090.0038) than the COGC and LOGC \ngroups. EOGC patients showed the best overall survival rate compared to COGC \n(p\u2009=\u20090.0110) and LOGC (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). After stratified by TNM stage, LOGC patients \nhad the worst survival among all stages. When considering the patients with AEG, \nthe EOGC group showed the worst survival outcome (p\u2009=\u20090.0130). Only patients \nwith COGC showed improved survival with chemotherapy compared to those without \nit (stage II: p\u2009=\u20090.0051; stage III: p\u2009=\u20090.0160).\nCONCLUSION: A decreasing trend in the EOGC surgical population has been observed \nover the past 20\u00a0years at West China Hospital. Compared to COGC patients, EOGC \npatients had a higher proportion of females, SRCC cases, poorer differentiation, \nand lower Her-2 expression, but demonstrated a better survival outcome. \nConversely, the worst prognosis outcome was observed in EOGC patients within the \nAEG subgroup. LOGC was an independent negative factor for survival results. \nChemotherapy did not improve the prognosis for EOGC and LOGC patients at stage \nII and III."}

This study highlights distinct \ngenomic and microenvironmental strategies governing BC subtype-specific fates \nafter NAC."}

SLNB and SUVmax (Maximum Standard Unit Value) results \nwere compared.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting \naxillary metastasis was the primary outcome. Interrater reliability testing in \ndetermining the agreement between 18F-FDG PET/CT and SLNB was the secondary \noutcome.\nSAMPLE SIZE: 248.\nRESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET/CT \nfor detecting axillary metastasis were 62%, 92%, 88%, 71% and 77%, respectively. \nCohen's Kappa coefficient (0.54) showed moderate agreement with SLNB (P<.001). \nTumors with positive HER2 gene amplification [HER2 (+) and Luminal B HER2 (+) \nhave higher sensitivity than other subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B HER2 (-) and \ntriple negative). HER2 gene amplification also increases the agreement between \n18F-FDG-PET/CT and SLNB results.\nCONCLUSION: 18F-FDG-PET/CT has a high specificity but low sensitivity for \nipsilateral axillary metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of \nHER2 gene amplification can increase sensitivity and concordance with SLNB.\nLIMITATIONS: Retrospective design and limited number of patients for each \nsubtype."}

We \nreport results from the\u00a0phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts in advanced solid tumors \nand phase 2 expansion cohorts for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer \n(TNBC) from the first-in-human MK-2870-001 (KL264-01) study (NCT04152499).\nMETHODS: Patients had unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors \nrefractory to standard therapies. In the\u00a0phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts, \npatients had unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors refractory to \nstandard therapies. Sac-TMT was administered by intravenous administration every \n2\u00a0weeks at 2 to 12\u00a0mg/kg. In phase 2, patients with TNBC and HR+/HER2-\u2009breast \ncancer received sac-TMT per recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) identified in \nphase 1. Primary objectives were determining maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of \nsac-TMT and establishing RDEs (phase 1) and determining ORR per RECIST v1.1 by \ninvestigator assessment (phase 2). Adverse events were assessed per NCI-CTCAE \nversion 5.0.\nRESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled in phase 1 and received sac-TMT 2\u00a0mg/kg \n(n\u2009=\u20094), 4\u00a0mg/kg (n\u2009=\u20097), 5\u00a0mg/kg (n\u2009=\u20097), 5.5\u00a0mg/kg (n\u2009=\u20095), and 6\u00a0mg/kg \n(n\u2009=\u20097). Five patients had dose-limiting toxicities: grade 3 stomatitis at 4, \n5.5, and 6\u00a0mg/kg; grade 3 rash at 5\u00a0mg/kg; and grade 3 urticaria at 6\u00a0mg/kg. MTD \nwas 5.5\u00a0mg/kg and RDEs were 4 and 5\u00a0mg/kg. In the\u00a0phase 2 dose expansion, ORR \n(95% CI) was 34.8% (16.4%, 57.3%) in the 4-mg/kg group (n\u2009=\u200923) and 38.9% \n(23.1%, 56.5%) in the\u00a05-mg/kg group (n\u2009=\u200936) for TNBC. ORR (95% CI) was 31.7% \n(18.1%, 48.1%) for HR+/HER2-\u2009breast cancer (n\u2009=\u200941).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sac-TMT demonstrated manageable safety profile in patients with \nunresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors and promising antitumor \nactivity in metastatic TNBC and HR+/HER2\u2009-\u2009breast cancer. Sac-TMT is being \ninvestigated in phase 3 studies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04152499."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "HER2", "text": "BACKGROUND: Protein kinases play important roles in fundamental biological \nprocesses. Aberrant activities may result in many diseases, thus the detection \nof multiplex kinase activities is important in clinical diagnosis. Recent \nprogress has focused on the mass spectrometric biosensing technique to enable \nhighly sensitive detection of multiplex targets. However, the application of the \ndeveloped methods in multiplex enzyme analysis is greatly challenged due to the \nsubstrate immobilization on solid interfaces, which affect the contact between \nsubstrates and enzymes to reduce enzyme reaction efficiency.\nRESULTS: This work developed a homogeneous mass-encoded method for biosensing of \nmultiplex proteins, which was performed using designed peptides containing the \ncoding sequences and substrate regions. With the assistance of titanium dioxide \ncoated magnetic beads (TiO2-MBs) to capture the phosphopeptide products, \nfollowed by trypsin to cleave the products for releasing the coding sequences, \nthe kinase assays were achieved by submitting the supernatant for ultrahigh \nperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) \nanalysis. Using protein kinase A (PKA) and human epidermal growth factor \nreceptor 2 (HER2) as model targets, the peak area ratios of the coding sequences \nto the internal standards showed linear relations of 1.0-100\u00a0ng\u00a0mL-1 and 0.2-20 \nU\u00a0mL-1, with the detection limits of 0.46\u00a0ng\u00a0mL-1 and 0.033 U\u00a0mL-1 for HER2 and \nPKA, respectively. The proposed strategy also demonstrated great practicability \nin inhibition analysis and kinase activity assays in cell lysates.\nSIGNIFICANCE: A homogeneous mass-encoded method for multiplex detection of \nkinase activities could simplify the assay procedure and reveal the enzyme \nactivities with free substrates. The strategy enabled multiplex kinase activity \nassays with convenience, high sensitivity, and high specificity, demonstrating \npromising applications in clinical fields."}

However, about 40\u202f% of patients develop \nresistance to this treatment. Adding TKIs like pyrotinib to anti-HER2 antibodies \nmay enhance efficacy and reduce resistance, but the mechanisms are not fully \nunderstood.\nMETHODS: Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analyzed tissues from 26 patients treated \nwith NeoPICD (docetaxel, carboplatin, pyrotinib, inetetamab) and 21 patients \ntreated with TCbHP. Cellular changes and spatial relationships were assessed \npre- and post-treatment. A co-culture system of tumor cells, fibroblasts, and \nPBMCs were used to examined cytotoxic T-cell function. A predictive model for \ntreatment outcomes was constructed based on these results.\nRESULTS: In TCbHP-sensitive patients, IDOhiHLA-DRhi epithelial cells expressing \nPD-L1 were enriched and interacted with Ki67+ T cells and M1 macrophages. In \nTCbHP-resistant patients, fibroblasts formed a barrier that hindered immune cell \naccess, critical for resistance. NeoPICD disrupted this barrier, enhancing \nimmune cell infiltration and alleviating resistance. Machine learning based on \nspatial cell architecture can predict treatment outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: Spatial organization of cellular interactions in the tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME) provides insights into prognosis beyond pathological \nsubtypes. The role of NeoPICD in disruption of fibroblast barriers and \nenhancement of immune cell function suggests therapeutic advantages in \novercoming resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. This research offers new \nstrategies for precision treatment of locally advanced HER2-positive breast \ncancer."}

Enhanced CT scan showed a 3.7*3.0 cm round-like \nsoft tissue density foci at the lower pole of the left kidney, with obvious \ninhomogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent a laparoscopic partial \nnephrectomy of the left kidney. Histologic and immunohistochemical results \nshowed typical features of PRNRP, including a papillary structure covered by a \nsingle layer of cuboidal cells with finely grained eosinophilic cytoplasm, \nnuclei that were mostly regular and apically located, and GATA3 (+). The biopsy \nof pericarcinoma tissue showed membranous nephropathy and glomerular segmental \nsclerosis.

In vitro, IL-9 levels in the supernatant of sorted ILC2s from CLL \npatients increased. Treatment with anti-IL-9 antibody significantly reduced the \nPD-1+ Treg and TIGIT+ Treg cells while increasing granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells \n(P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, there was no significant effect on Treg, CTLA-4+ Treg, and \nperforin+ CD8+ T cells (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Additionally, anti-IL-9 antibody \nsignificantly increased early apoptosis (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: ILC2s affect CD8+ T cells and Treg cells through IL-9, weakening the \nanti-tumor effects of CD8+ T cells and enhancing the immunosuppressive effects \nof Treg cells, thereby contributing to CLL pathogenesis."}

Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR was performed to assess the \nrelative H3K18la enrichment on phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) promoter. \nFinally, we established the tumor-bearing mouse model. Results showed that A549 \nand H1299 cells showed increased pan-kla and H3K18la protein levels. Besides, \nsilencing of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inhibited the cell viability, \nproliferation, migration, and glycolysis in A549 and H1299 cells. Animal study \nresults indicated that LDHA inhibition suppressed the tumor growth in xenografts \nmice. Mechanically, LDHA-mediated H3K18la regulated the transcription and \nstability of PTEN in A549 and H1229 cells. Final rescue results demonstrated \nthat PTEN deficiency increased the cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis \nin A549 and H1299 cells.

Despite advances in understanding, the \nmolecular regulation of bone regeneration remains incompletely understood. \nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as critical post-transcriptional regulators of \ngene expression, with growing evidence suggesting their roles in osteogenesis \nand fracture repair. This study investigates the role of miRNA-130b in fracture \nhealing and its molecular mechanisms, particularly focusing on its interaction \nwith phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling \npathway.\nMETHODS: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from rats and \ntransfected with miRNA-130b mimic, inhibitor, or siPTEN. Osteogenic \ndifferentiation was assessed via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin \nred S staining, and scratch wound healing assays. Pathway activation was \nevaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. A rat tibial fracture model was \nestablished, and miRNA-130b mimic was administered intraperitoneally. Fracture \nhealing was assessed via radiography, histology, and biomechanical testing at 2, \n4, and 6 weeks post-surgery.\nRESULTS: MiRNA-130b overexpression enhanced BMSC proliferation, migration, and \nosteogenic differentiation by directly targeting PTEN and activating the \nWnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Conversely, miRNA-130b inhibition reduced \nosteogenic activity. MiRNA-130b mimic accelerated fracture healing, as evidenced \nby improved callus formation, enhanced bone mineralization, and superior \nbiomechanical properties compared to control groups.\nCONCLUSION: miRNA-130b promotes osteogenesis and fracture healing by targeting \nPTEN and activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

Such a mutation can \noriginate malignant and benign tumors, including dysplastic gangliocytoma of the \nposterior cranial fossa.\nMETHODS: We present two illustrative cases of Lhermitte-Duclos disease that we \nencountered and surgically treated during the last few years. We also performed \na systematic literature review concerned with the surgical management of \nLhermitte-Duclos disease and Cowden syndrome.\nRESULTS: Both patients were young females complaining of occipital headaches and \nunderwent brain MRIs that revealed unilateral discrete cerebellar atrophy and \nexpansive lesions of the posterior cranial fossa with characteristic striate T-2 \nweighted hyperintensity resembling tiger fur. They were both successfully \noperated on due to the posterior fossa dysplastic gangliocytoma, which was \nhistopathologically confirmed as Lhermitte-Duclos disease.

SFXN1 is upregulated in BLCA tissues, and \npromotes BLCA metastasis through its unrevealed function of restraining \nPINK1-dependent mitophagy rather than its classical role as a mitochondrial \nserine transporter to promote cell proliferation. Specifically, SFXN1 acted as \nan essential bridging factor to promote PINK1 degradation by interacting with \nPARL and MPP-\u03b2 on the IMM, leading to mitophagy arrest and mtROS accumulation, \nthus activated TGF-\u03b2-mediated EMT and promoted BLCA metastasis (This figure was \ncreated by Figdraw)."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NTRK1", "text": "INTRODUCTION: NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 gene fusions are rare oncogenic driver \nalterations found in diverse tumor types of adults and children. They are \nclinically important biomarkers as tumors harboring these genomic alterations \nhave high response rates to targeted therapy. Routine testing for NTRK fusions \nand treatment with TRK inhibitors has been recommended in multiple tumor types; \nhowever, differences between testing technologies used for detecting NTRK \nfusions can result in variable likelihoods of identification.\nMETHODS: To assess the prevalence of NTRK fusions in a real-world \nstandard-of-care setting, we analyzed data from 19,591 FFPE samples encompassing \n35 solid tumor types submitted for comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) as part \nof routine clinical care. CGP testing included DNA hybrid-capture sequencing to \ndetect small variants, copy number alterations, microsatellite instability \n(MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB). RNA hybrid-capture sequencing was \nconcurrently performed to detect fusions and splice variants. Detected NTRK \nfusions were categorized as oncogenic, likely oncogenic, or variant of unknown \nsignificance (VUS) based on the fusion partner, orientation, and breakpoint \nposition.\nRESULTS: 73 oncogenic or likely oncogenic NTRK fusions were identified in 69 \nunique tumor specimens across 19 tumor types for a total cohort prevalence of \n0.35%. Tumor types with the highest NTRK fusion prevalence included glioblastoma \n(1.91%), small intestine (1.32%), and head and neck (0.95%) tumors with other \nsolid tumor types ranging from 0.19% (uterine) to 0.63% (breast). We identified \ndiverse intra and inter-chromosomal partner genes for NTRK fusions across all \ntumor types. Most NTRK fusions were detected in only one tumor specimen, though \nsome recurrent fusions were noted with ETV6, TPM3, LMNA, EML4, TPR, PEAR1, \nIRF2BP2, and KANK1 fusion partners. Most NTRK fusions were mutually exclusive \nfrom other genomic driver alterations, however, almost a third of tumor \nspecimens (29%) contained at least one co-occurring genomic driver, which may \naffect treatment decisions.\nDISCUSSION: The high prevalence of oncogenic and likely oncogenic NTRK fusions \ndetected in our analysis suggests that RNA hybrid-capture-based sequencing for \nfusion detection is a highly sensitive method for identifying clinically \nmeaningful known and novel NTRK fusions, which may be missed with other \ndetection methods, directly impacting therapeutic options and patient outcomes."}

Our assay \nsuccessfully identified 62 out of 63 known gene fusions, achieving a sensitivity \nof 98.4%. The specificity of the assay was 100%, as no fusions were detected in \nthe 21 fusion-negative samples. Good repeatability and reproducibility were \nobserved in replicates, except for the TPM3::NTRK1 fusion, which was expressed \nbelow the threshold. Of all fusions identified in 101 NSCLC samples, 68.9% \n(20/29) were potentially actionable, compared to 20% in pan-cancer samples. In \naddition to actionable fusions, we also identified many fusions with potential \ndiagnostic and prognostic value in pan-cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel WTS assay with high sensitivity, \nspecificity, repeatability and reproducibility.

Moreover, geographical variations in the genomic \nlandscape of gastrointestinal cancers have not been fully elucidated. This \nretrospective study aimed to gain insight into the genomic landscape of patients \nwith gastrointestinal cancers from the Asia and Middle East (AME) region using \nplasma-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).\nMETHODS: From routine clinical practice, 2,601 plasma samples were collected \nfrom 2,062 patients with gastrointestinal cancers in the AME region.

Common \nhistologies included adenocarcinoma (57.1%), NSCLC not otherwise specified \n(19.3%), and squamous cell carcinoma (7%). Genomic alterations were detected in \n80.6% patients according to the PulmoCORE panel; 64.2% patients had actionable \nalterations in at least one of the nine biomarkers with Food and Drug \nAdministration-approved targeted therapies, that is, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, \nBRAF, NTRK1/2/3, MET, RET, and ERBB2.

AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), \nwhich is a key subunit of SWI/SNF complexes, demonstrates critical regulatory \nfunctions as a tumour suppressor gene in cancer. The aim of this study is to \ndetermine the role of ARID1A deficiency in the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs \nin LUAD.\nMETHODS: We identified the ARID1A mutation as a potential prognostic marker in \nEGFR-mutant LUAD by analysing data from cBioPortal. The expression of ARID1A was \ndetected via immunohistochemical staining. A lentivirus was employed to \nconstruct the ARID1A knockdown model in PC9 cell. We further analyzed the \nbiological roles of ARID1A knockdown through CCK8, flow cytometry analysis and \ntranswell assay.\nRESULTS: The ARID1A mutation was associated with poor OS in EGFR-mutant LUAD \npatients, and the prognostic influence was greater than that of concurrent EGFR \nmutations with TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, RB1 or PTEN. By analysing the \nclinical data of our centre, we revealed that patients with loss of ARID1A \nexpression demonstrated poorer median progression-free survival (mPFS, 10.3 \nversus 30 months, P = 0.005) when they received EGFR-TKIs as the first-line \ntreatment after postoperative progression (cohort A). A shorter median \ndisease-free survival (mDFS, 29 versus NA months, P = 0.003) was also observed \nin the ARID1A low-expression cohort than in the ARID1A high-expression group in \npatients receiving postoperative adjuvant EGFR-TKI treatments (cohort B). We \nalso found that ARID1A deficiency attenuated the efficacy of osimertinib by \nactivating the EGFR/AKT/mTOR signalling axis in PC9 cell.\nCONCLUSION: ARID1A deficiency may be an independent prognostic factor and \nattenuates the response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD. In \naddition, loss of ARID1A expression confers resistance to EGFR-TKI by activating \nthe EGFR/AKT/mTOR signalling axis."}

The prediction of clinically relevant genetic mutations via \nhistopathological images could facilitate the expedited identification of \ngenetic mutations in clinical settings.\nMETHODS: We collected 2,221 slides from 1999 patients diagnosed with lung \nadenocarcinoma. The data include whole-slide images data as well as information \non gene mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, and other rare genes (ROS1, RET, \nBRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS), and related clinical information. The self-supervised model \nDINO and the two-stage multi-instance network GAMIL were employed to accurately \nidentify mutation statuses in 9 genes linked to tumorigenesis and cancer \nprogression. The comparison of model performance involves the utilization of \nvarious foundation model (UNI), classification models (CLAM and Inception v3), \nexternal datasets (TCGA and other medical institutions), and comparative \nanalysis with human pathologists.\nRESULTS: Our approach outperforms the CLAM and inception v3 model, achieving AUC \nvalues ranging from 0.825 to 0.987 for predicting gene mutations. The AUC value \non the external test data set is 0.516-0.843.

Because of the \napproval of capmatinib for patients with MET exon 14 mutated tumors and the \nrelated poor response to immunotherapy (ICI) for a subset of patients with MET \nmutated tumors, MET screening has become mandatory for first line treatment \ndecision. Here we report our testing experience based on 1143 consecutive NSCLC \naddressed for molecular diagnosis. Two strategies using either DNA sequencing \n(NGS) and fragment analysis or DNA-RNA sequencing (NGS) were developed and \nvalidated to accurately detect MET exon 14 alterations including large \ndeletions. For patients with MET tumors (n\u2009=\u200946), demographic characteristics, \ntreatments and outcomes were obtained from medical records and discussed. 46 MET \nexon 14 alterations were identified, 4 were not called by DNA sequencing and \nrescued by fragment analysis or RNA sequencing. Sixty-seven percent tumors had a \nhigh PD-L1 expression\u2009>\u200950 and 42% of cases had co-occurring alterations, mainly \nTP53 mutations (24%) and PIK3CA mutations (9%). Response to MET inhibitors \n(Crizotinib and Capmatinib) was evaluated for 15 patients. The ORR (Objective \nResponse Rate) and the median of PFS (Progression Free Survival) were 44% and \n5.5\u00a0months [1.6-18.2\u00a0months] respectively. Thirteen patients were treated by \nimmunotherapy, ORR and median PFS (Progression Free Survival) median were 30% \nand 4\u00a0months [0.7-55.5\u00a0months] respectively. The response to immunotherapy was \nnot correlated with PD-L1 status but smokers seemed to better respond to ICIs. \nThis study highlights that a multimodal approach may be necessary to detect MET \nexon 14 mutations as large deletions may not be detected by DNA sequencing. \nTargeted DNA-ARN sequencing strategies broadly interrogate the diverse druggable \ngenomic variations and permits direct detection of altered splicing or gene \nfusions. Because patients with MET exon 14 mutated tumors, demonstrate low \nresponse to immunotherapy despite high PDL1 and because MET exon 14 is druggable \nthe detection of MET mutations is mandatory to optimize treatment."}

In the current report, we provide the \nresults of the final analysis of overall survival, including updated data on \nefficacy and safety.\nRESULTS: A total of 161 patients were assigned to the inavolisib group, and 164 \nto the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 34.2 months in the inavolisib \ngroup and 32.3 months in the placebo group, the median overall survival was 34.0 \nmonths (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.4 to 44.8) with inavolisib and 27.0 \nmonths (95% CI, 22.8 to 38.7) with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% \nCI, 0.48 to 0.94; P\u2009=\u20090.02 [prespecified boundary for statistical significance, \nP<0.0469]). An objective response occurred in 62.7% (95% CI, 54.8 to 70.2) of \npatients in the inavolisib group and 28.0% (95% CI, 21.3 to 35.6) of those in \nthe placebo group (P<0.001).

For patients refractory to conventional treatments, \nalthough compassionate use of monoclonal antibodies has developed, experience \nremains limited.\nMETHODS: We conducted a national multicenter study across French pediatric \ntertiary care centers where children (younger than 18 years) who presented with \nEoE were treated with biological therapies between January 2015 and December \n2023. The main objective was to characterize this patient population, and the \nindications for prescribing biologics. The secondary goals were to assess these \npatients' clinical, endoscopic, and histologic finding, as well as patient \ntolerance, and to compare our cohort at baseline with pediatric patients from \ntwo European registers of EoE treated with conventional therapies.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six patients were prescribed 37 biologics (omalizumab, n\u2009=\u20091; \nmepolizumab, n\u2009=\u20096; dupilumab, n\u2009=\u200930). At diagnosis, the mean patient age was \n7.4 (\u00b14.4) years, and most patients had at least one atopic comorbidity (91.7%, \nn\u2009=\u200933). Failure of first-line treatments was the main reason for starting \nbiological therapy (75.7%, n\u2009=\u200928), prescribed as compassionate use (54.1%, \nn\u2009=\u200920). Dupilumab showed significant clinical (48%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and histological \n(82.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) improvement. Compared with children treated with conventional \ntherapies, patients in our cohort at baseline presented significantly more \nasthma, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis, as well as more fibrostenotic \nphenotype and digestive symptoms. No severe side effect was reported within a \n6-12-month follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Dupilumab is the most frequently prescribed, and appears to be the \nmost effective biotherapy, regarding clinical and histologic remission. All \nbiologics were well-tolerated.\nIMPACT: Pending marketing authorization, biological therapies for pediatric \neosinophilic esophagitis are mainly prescribed after failure of first-line \ntreatments and on a compassionate basis in France. Dupilumab is the biotherapy \nmost frequently used, is associated with clinical and histological efficacy and \nis well-tolerated. Children and adolescents requiring biologics appear to be \nyounger and more severe at diagnosis than naive pediatric patients in Europeans \nregistries."}

Combination of HDAC inhibitor(s) with other inhibitor(s) have \nshown synergistic activity in cancer chemotherapy by modulating a variety of \ntherapeutic targets including epigenetic target of cancer cells by restoring \nacetylation and reactivating tumor suppressor genes leading to cell cycle \narrest, promoting apoptosis, and thus inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.\nAREAS COVERED: A comprehensive published patent literature (2020-present) on \nrational combinations of HDAC inhibitor(s) for cancer chemotherapy has been \nretrieved and reviewed from various patent databases including Google Patents, \nEspacenet, Patentscope, WIPO and USPTO etc. to analyze the rational combinations \nfor better, optimized and precise cancer therapy. In this second part of \ntwo-part review, we highlighted the patent published for the combination.\nEXPERT OPINION: The HDAC inhibitor(s) in combination with other therapeutically \nrelevant inhibitor(s) such as MAPK, GSK3, PI3K/mTOR, PARP, CDK9, HSP90, BTK, \nBRD4, JAK, VEGF, ALK, PD-1, or PDE inhibitor etc. showed synergistic anti-cancer \nactivity.

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "ALK", "text": "BACKGROUND: Ether lipids are important constituents of biological membranes and \nharbor fatty alcohols attached via ether linkages to the sn-1 position of the \nglycerol backbone. Depending on the nature of the ether bond, they are \nsubdivided into 1-O-alkyl (plasmanyl) and 1-O-alk-1'-enyl (plasmenyl) \nsubclasses. They often contain polyunsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position, \nimplicating them in cellular signaling and inflammatory processes including \nlipid mediator biosynthesis. Lipid mediators are produced by immune and \nnon-immune cells, have diverse homeostatic and immunoregulatory functions and, \ntogether with other factors, orchestrate the initiation and resolution of \ninflammation. To date, alkylglycerol monooxygenase is the only known enzyme \ncapable of cleaving alkylglycerols, one of two ether lipid subclasses. However, \nthe exact role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase and that of its substrates in \nlipid mediator biosynthesis remains unclear.\nRESULTS: Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate a sex- and cell \ntype-dependent role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase in limiting prostanoid \nformation without affecting polyunsaturated fatty acid release, as revealed by \nmetabololipidomics profiling of lipid mediators using ultra-performance liquid \nchromatography\u2012tandem mass spectrometry. This female-specific effect is driven \nby the suppression of prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 transcription, as deficiency \nin alkylglycerol monooxygenase significantly elevated prostaglandin G/H synthase \n2 gene expression in female bone marrow-derived macrophages of the M1 phenotype. \nFurthermore, this regulatory role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase extends to \nvisceral white adipose tissue, where elevated prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 \nexpression and enhanced prostaglandin E2 production were observed in female \nsamples following alkylglycerol monooxygenase knockout.\nCONCLUSION: Our results expand the immunomodulatory functions of ether lipid \nmetabolism and highlight the sex- and cell type-dependent role of alkylglycerol \nmonooxygenase in controlling lipid mediator production and maintaining tissue \nhomeostasis."}

Treatments were followed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) and necropsy. Treatment zone size (with emphasis on the \ncranial-caudal (CC) dimension), volume, and a survey for complications were \nconducted by MRI and at necropsy. Histopathology was performed to confirm \ncomplete cell kill in the treatment zone. Treatment precision was assessed by \nthe width of the transition zone (TZ, zone of partial treatment) with a narrower \nTZ denoting increased precision.\nRESULTS: Animals tolerated treatments with no adverse events. Treatment zones \ncreated during HFJV were less elongated than during CV (CC dimension during \nHFJV\u2009=\u200927.8\u00a0mm vs. CV\u2009=\u200932.3\u00a0mm, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Mean TZ width (treatment precision) \nwas narrower in the HFJV group (HFJV\u2009=\u20094.1\u00a0mm, CV\u2009=\u20096.9\u00a0mm, p\u2009<\u20090.001), \nparticularly at the cranial margin (HFJV\u2009=\u20094.0\u00a0mm, CV\u2009=\u20098.2, p\u2009=\u20090.018). \nOff-target treatments occurred in the chest wall (n\u2009=\u20092) and spleen (n\u2009=\u20091).\nCONCLUSION: High-frequency jet ventilation reduces the craniocaudal elongation \nof histotripsy treatment zones caused by respiratory motion and improves the \nprecision of histotripsy compared to conventional ventilation in this animal \nmodel."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "CDKN2A", "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling orthopedic disease \ncharacterized by hyperactivation of osteoclasts and impairment of osteogenesis. \nHowever, the underlying mechanism by which osteoclastogenesis is driven in ONFH \nremains unclear. Although cellular senescence is hypothesized to contribute to \nthe development of multiple comorbidities, the role of cellular senescence in \nONFH remains underexplored. In this study, we explored whether clearing \nsenescent cells ameliorates ONFH. Analyses of single-cell sequencing data \nrevealed that the population of osteoclasts increased in ONFH, and the \nexpression of senescence-related genes (CDKN1A and CDKN2A) in macrophages was \nelevated in ONFH patients. Additionally, we found that senescent macrophages in \nONFH mice were significantly increased, as evidenced by an increased population \nof SA-\u03b2-gal positive cells and F4/80+p21+ cells in the femoral head. \nTartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining results further revealed \nthat osteoclasts in ONFH mice increased. In the in vitro experiments of bone \nmarrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), treatment with low-dose tert-butyl \nhydroperoxide (t-BHP) increased the number of senescent macrophages, thereby \npromoting their osteoclastogenesis, while inhibiting their osteogenic/angiogenic \nabilities. Administration of senolytic drugs (Dasatinib and Quercetin, D\u00a0+\u00a0Q) \ndiminished t-BHP-induced cellular senescence and osteoclastogenesis in BMDMs. \nMoreover, clearing senescent BMDMs rescued their anti-inflammatory phenotype and \nosteogenic/angiogenic abilities. In the in vivo experiments, treatment with \nD\u00a0+\u00a0Q relieved the methylprednisolone (MPS)-induced hyperactivation of \nosteoclasts. Additionally, these senolytic drugs enhanced the processes of \nangiogenesis and osteogenesis in ONFH mice. Collectively, these findings suggest \nthat cellular senescence in macrophages facilitates the hyperactivation of \nosteoclasts and the progression of ONFH, indicating that clearing senescent \ncells holds significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of ONFH."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "CDKN2A", "text": "OBJECTIVE: The skin, as the largest organ of the body, plays a critical role in \nhomeostasis and protecting against environmental stressors. Sebaceous glands \n(SGs) produce sebum, which forms a lipid barrier essential for preventing \ndehydration and defending against oxidative and microbial damage. However, \nageing and environmental factors such as UV exposure and pollution impair SG \nfunction, leading to skin dryness and loss of radiance. Pterostilbene, a natural \nantioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects, has not been extensively studied for \nits potential impact on ageing SG cells. This study aims to investigate the \nprotective effects of pterostilbene on SG function under UV-induced damage and \nits role in collagen repair in UV-exposed fibroblasts.\nMETHODS: To examine the effects of pterostilbene on UVA-induced damage, an \nin\u00a0vitro model of UV-exposed sebocytes was developed. The influence of \npterostilbene on lipid synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and gene \nexpression related to senescence and inflammation was assessed. In parallel, the \neffects of pterostilbene on collagen synthesis (types I and III) and ROS levels \nin UV-exposed fibroblasts were analysed. Super-resolution fluorescence \nmicroscopy was utilized to visualize collagen production and F-actin integrity \nin fibroblasts treated with pterostilbene.\nRESULTS: Pterostilbene increased lipid synthesis by 16% and reduced ROS levels \nby 62.43% in UV-damaged sebocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed \nupregulation of antioxidant genes (Nrf2, Sirt6) and downregulation of \ndifferentiation-related genes (Blimp1, c-Myc). In UV-exposed fibroblasts, \npterostilbene significantly enhanced collagen types I and III levels and reduced \nROS by 40.07%. High-resolution microscopy showed that pterostilbene restored the \ndistribution of F-actin in fibroblasts affected by UVA.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that pterostilbene effectively protects \nagainst UVA-induced damage in both sebocytes and fibroblasts. By promoting lipid \nsynthesis, reducing oxidative stress, and stimulating collagen production, \npterostilbene presents a promising natural ingredient for anti-ageing skincare \nformulations. Its multifunctional mechanisms suggest its potential to enhance \nskin health by supporting sebaceous gland function and improving overall skin \nresilience."}

Traditional cytogenetic techniques are limited by \ntheir low resolution, whereas optical genome mapping offers enhanced \ncapabilities for detecting chromosomal rearrangements and determining genomic \nlocalization and orientation. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy of \noptical genome mapping in identifying complex balanced chromosomal \nrearrangements that may contribute to fertility challenges.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old Asian female patient with a history of \nrecurrent abortions was included in the study. Peripheral blood samples were \ncollected for high-resolution karyotyping, chromosomal microarray analysis, and \noptical genome mapping. The high-resolution karyotype analysis identified \ncomplex chromosomal abnormalities. Optical genome mapping has revealed \nadditional cryptic chromosomal aberrations, such as ins (2; 12) (p16.1; q12q12), \ninv (6) (q21q21), and inv (12) (q12q12), offering a novel perspective on this \ncase. Notably, the disrupted genes, including CRIM1, MUC19, and PRDM1, have not \nbeen classified as pathogenic by existing databases.\nCONCLUSION: This study underscores the capability of optical genome mapping to \ndeliver comprehensive and precise information. It is anticipated that optical \ngenome mapping will emerge as a valuable cytogenetic tool within clinical \ngenetic methodologies, providing new references and insights for clinical \npractice in the future."}

Research showed \nthat YAP1 was markedly reduced in the brains of individuals with AD. However, \nthe mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of the Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway \nin the context of LOAD remain unclear.\nMETHODS: AAV9-YAP1-RNAi was injected into the hippocampi of C57BL/6J mice to \nestablish a YAP1 knockdown model. Overexpression of full-length YAP1 was \nachieved by injecting AAV9-YAP1 into the hippocampi of SAMP8 mice. To establish \nthe model of knockdown of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1), \nAAV9-Nr4a1-RNAi was injected into the hippocampi of SAMP8 mice. In the C57BL/6J \nmice with YAP1 knockdown, Nr4a1 expression was either knocked down or inhibited \nwith DIM-C to examine the impact of Nr4a1 on tau phosphorylation and cognitive \ndeficits. Primary hippocampal neurons from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were \ninfected with lentivirus (LV)-YAP1 to create a YAP1 overexpression model, and A\u03b2 \ntreatment was used to induce neuronal senescence. Protein levels were assessed \nusing immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and ELISA. Animal behavior was \nevaluated using the Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and \nopen field test.\nRESULTS: YAP1 was reduced in the hippocampus of both aged C57BL/6J mice and \nSAMP8 AD model mice through Hippo pathway activation, as well as in A\u03b2-induced \nsenescent neurons. Overexpression of YAP1 in primary neurons significantly \nmitigated the A\u03b2-induced neuronal senescence by downregulating several \nsenescence-related genes, including p16 and p53. The levels of phosphorylated \nAKT/GSK-3\u03b2 in neurons were increased with overexpression of YAP1 both in vivo \nand in vitro. Knockdown of YAP1 induced AD-like symptoms and exacerbated \ncognitive decline in 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Injection of AAV9-YAP1 in the \nbrains of SAMP8 mice partially alleviated neuronal senescence and enhanced \ncognitive function. Notably, genetic knockdown and chemical inhibition of Nr4a1 \nsignificantly ameliorated cognitive deficits as well as AD-like pathology in \nthese subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal an etiopathogenic relationship between aging \nand AD, which is associated with the YAP1-Nr4a1-AKT/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway. \nOur findings provide insight into\u00a0the therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying \nbrain aging and combating neurodegenerative diseases such as AD."}

AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), \nwhich is a key subunit of SWI/SNF complexes, demonstrates critical regulatory \nfunctions as a tumour suppressor gene in cancer. The aim of this study is to \ndetermine the role of ARID1A deficiency in the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs \nin LUAD.\nMETHODS: We identified the ARID1A mutation as a potential prognostic marker in \nEGFR-mutant LUAD by analysing data from cBioPortal. The expression of ARID1A was \ndetected via immunohistochemical staining. A lentivirus was employed to \nconstruct the ARID1A knockdown model in PC9 cell. We further analyzed the \nbiological roles of ARID1A knockdown through CCK8, flow cytometry analysis and \ntranswell assay.\nRESULTS: The ARID1A mutation was associated with poor OS in EGFR-mutant LUAD \npatients, and the prognostic influence was greater than that of concurrent EGFR \nmutations with TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, RB1 or PTEN. By analysing the \nclinical data of our centre, we revealed that patients with loss of ARID1A \nexpression demonstrated poorer median progression-free survival (mPFS, 10.3 \nversus 30 months, P = 0.005) when they received EGFR-TKIs as the first-line \ntreatment after postoperative progression (cohort A). A shorter median \ndisease-free survival (mDFS, 29 versus NA months, P = 0.003) was also observed \nin the ARID1A low-expression cohort than in the ARID1A high-expression group in \npatients receiving postoperative adjuvant EGFR-TKI treatments (cohort B). We \nalso found that ARID1A deficiency attenuated the efficacy of osimertinib by \nactivating the EGFR/AKT/mTOR signalling axis in PC9 cell.\nCONCLUSION: ARID1A deficiency may be an independent prognostic factor and \nattenuates the response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD. In \naddition, loss of ARID1A expression confers resistance to EGFR-TKI by activating \nthe EGFR/AKT/mTOR signalling axis."}

Novel therapeutic strategies targeting \ninflammageing-driven mechanisms are urgently required to attenuate adverse \nventricular remodelling following MI. This investigation was designed to \nelucidate the impact of fibroblast-specific p16INK4a on inflammageing-associated \nventricular remodelling after MI and to develop a targeted nanotherapy to \nmitigate this process.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We found that p16-mediated inflammageing positively \ncorrelated with the severity of post-infarction ventricular remodelling in \npatients. POSTN-driven p16INK4a knockout improved cardiac function, and reduced \nventricular remodelling, myocardial inflammation and NLRP3 signalling activation \nfollowing MI through downregulating STAT3-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome and \nupregulating glutathione metabolism pathway in fibroblasts. P16INK4a \noverexpression induced NLRP3 signalling activation through upregulating NLRP3 \ntranscribed by STAT3 in fibroblasts. In terms of mechanisms, p16INK4a interacted \nwith STAT3, which depended on the SH2 domain of STAT3; P16INK4a promoted the \ninteraction of EZH2 and STAT3, increased the di-methylation on K49 and \nphosphorylation on Y705 of STAT3 by EZH2, and promoted NLRP3 transcription \nthrough regulating histone modification in the NLRP3 promoter by interfering the \nformation of Bmi-1-EZH2 or Bmi-1-BCL6 complex in fibroblasts. Injection of \np16INK4a-accumulated ageing cardiac fibroblasts, or p16INK4a overexpression \nadenovirus aggravated profibrosis and proinflammation in MI area. However, a \nnovel FH peptide 'FHKHKSPALSPV'-neutrophil membrane proteins (NMPs)-artificial \nlipid (Li) membranes-mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) core (FNLM)-nanocaged \np16INK4a-siRNA, as a newly constructed nanomaterial drug, could prevent \npost-infarction ventricular remodelling through inhibiting NLRP3 transcription \nin targeted cardiac fibroblasts and ameliorating proinflammation and \nprofibrosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: P16INK4a drives inflammageing-mediated post-MI ventricular \nremodeling by activating STAT3/NLRP3 signaling in fibroblasts. Targeting \np16INK4a via FNLM-siRNA nanotherapy represents a novel strategy to ameliorate \nadverse cardiac remodelling, offering translational potential for clinical \nintervention.\nKEY POINTS: Mechanistic Insight: P16INK4a activates NLRP3 transcription via \nSTAT3-EZH2 crosstalk, disrupting epigenetic complexes (Bmi-1-EZH2/BCL6) to \nexacerbate post-MI remodelling. Therapeutic Innovation: A fibroblast-targeted \nFNLM nanoparticle delivering p16INK4a-siRNA effectively silences NLRP3, reducing \npost-MI inflammageing. Translational Impact: This study identifies \np16INK4a-STAT3 as a druggable axis and proposes FNLM-p16INK4a-siRNA as a \npromising nanotherapy for clinical post-MI care."}

Visual sensitivities are common in \nautism, but whether differences in the retina might underlie these sensitivities \nis not well understood. This includes Fragile X syndrome, which is the most \ncommon syndromic cause of autism. We explored retinal function in the Fmr1 \nknockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. We focused on a specific type of \nretinal neuron homologous with primate ganglion cells, the \"sustained On alpha\" \nretinal ganglion cell, which plays roles in contrast sensing and binocular \nvision in mice. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure \nand dampened responses to light in male Fmr1 knockout mice. We show that \ndecreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E-I \nbalance. The change in E-I balance supports maintenance of circuit excitability \nsimilar to what has been observed in cortex.

Candidate MRI biomarkers included \nwhole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and \nwhole brain volumes.\nRESULTS: In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant \nvolume loss across an average interval of 1.32\u2009years for the whole brain, \ncerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large \nmagnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed \ndeterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in \nWMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all \n4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst \nbrain atrophy and WMHs.\nINTERPRETATION: Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing \nwhite matter deterioration, are correlated with FMR1 premutation size of CGG \nrepeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively \nshort interval of less than 2\u2009years, making them potentially suitable as \nsurrogate end points for clinical trials.

Rodent models of FXTAS show motor \nimpairments, pathological intranuclear inclusions, and heightened anxiety. \nHowever, the early onset of neuropsychiatric features and underlying mechanisms \nremain poorly understood. To address the above issues, we used the doxycycline \n(dox)-inducible 90CGG mouse model, with transgene activation at two \ndevelopmental stages: adolescence and young adulthood. Mice were evaluated in a \nbehavioural battery to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploration, and motor \ncoordination and learning. Next, we conducted a combination of ex vivo \nextracellular local field potential recordings to measure synaptic physiology \nand oscillatory activity in the limbic system, particularly in the basolateral \namygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vH) regions. Parvalbumin interneurons \nand intranuclear inclusions in the amygdala and hippocampus were investigated by \nimmunofluorescence, while mass spectrometry and gene set enrichment were used to \nidentify differentially expressed proteins molecular pathways. Adolescent 90CGG \nmice displayed early-onset hyperactivity, transitioning to heightened anxiety in \nyoung adulthood, coinciding with the accumulation of intranuclear inclusions in \nthe BLA and vH. Electrophysiological analysis revealed augmented gamma \noscillations in the vH, emerging during adolescence and persisting in young \nadulthood. These changes correlated with a reduction in parvalbumin interneurons \nin these regions, and together likely contribute to enhanced BLA excitability \nand impaired vH plasticity. Finally, proteomic analysis of the vH revealed \naltered proteins linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in \nadolescence and anxiety/depression in adulthood, aligning well with behavioural \nfindings. Importantly, these behavioural, electrophysiological, and cellular \nalterations were reversible upon transgene inactivation. This study reveals a \ntemporal progression of CGG premutation effects on behaviour, from hyperactivity \nto heightened anxiety to late onset motor dysfunction.

LRGs were sourced from the \nMSigDB database. Five key prognostic LRGs (MMP11, MMP12, HBB, VSIG2, and \nSERPINE1) were identified using univariate COX regression and least absolute \nshrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses. Patients were \nclassified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on a median risk score. We \nconducted prognostic analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), immune \nmicroenvironment analysis, immunotherapy responsiveness evaluation, and drug \nscreening in these groups.\nRESULTS: The high-risk group exhibited poorer prognosis compared to the low-risk \ngroup, as predicted by our nomogram for overall survival. Notably, the high-risk \ngroup, marked by higher stromal cell infiltration and RNA stemness scores \n(RNAss), showed increased susceptibility to immune evasion. In contrast, the \nlow-risk group demonstrated better responses to immunotherapy and greater \nsensitivity to chemotherapy. Single-cell analysis revealed that SERPINE1 is \npredominantly positively correlated with immune checkpoint expression, while \nVSIG2 exhibits a negative correlation.\nCONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated a novel lactate \nmetabolism-associated model, providing new insights into the prognosis and \nimmunotherapy of GC patients.

Functional validation included qRT-PCR, IHC, Western blot, and \nproliferation assays in MDA-MB-231 cells.\nRESULTS: Malignant cell type 3 exhibited the highest proliferative potential. \nPDE3B and HBB were identified as prognostic markers, strongly associated with \npoor survival and immune cell infiltration. Overexpression of these genes \nenhanced proliferation, while their knockout suppressed it.\nCONCLUSION: PDE3B and HBB drive breast cancer proliferation and immune \nmodulation, making them promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Further \nresearch should assess their potential in targeted therapies."}

Description of the biological \nfeatures and clinical outcomes of MBM will facilitate the design of rational \ntherapies.\nMETHODS: We examined the mutational landscape and gene expression profiles of \nMBM (74 patients) and ECM (34 patients) in paired patient samples from a \npreviously published dataset with whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA \nsequencing (RNAseq) data from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We also present \nfindings from MBM from a new cohort of 14 patients from Duke University to \nstrengthen investigation of somatic mutations and gene expression profiles. Gene \nSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to compare paired MBM versus lymph node \n(LN) metastases and skin metastases. Relative immune cell abundance was inferred \nusing deconvolution methods. Survival outcomes from craniotomy and associations \nwith biological features, BRAF mutation status, and PTEN expression were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: GSEA found that autophagy signaling pathways are enriched in MBM versus \nLN and skin metastases. BRAF was the most frequently mutated clinically relevant \ngene in MBM and ECM, with NRAS and PTEN also frequently altered in MBM. The most \nstrongly upregulated genes in autophagy pathways were glial fibrillary acidic \nprotein (GFAP) and hemoglobin beta (HBB). An increased proportion of \nimmune-suppressive M2 compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in MBM and \nECM was identified. There was not sufficient evidence for an association between \nBRAF V600 mutation status or expression and overall survival (OS) from \ncraniotomy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The mutational landscape and gene expression of MBM from the Duke \ncohort resembled those previously reported in the MDACC cohort. Upregulation of \nautophagy pathways was observed in patient-matched MBM versus LN and skin \nmetastases due to upregulation of two genes, GFAP and HBB. In MBM, higher M2:M1 \nratio may contribute to a therapeutically relevant immune-suppressive tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME)."}

Knowledge was assessed using a multiple-choice questionnaire, while skills \nwere evaluated using Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Data \nwere collected immediately post-training, six months later, and one year later. \nPaired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyze changes over \ntime.\nRESULTS: Of the 60 midwives initially trained, 50 (83.3%) participated in the \nfollow-up assessment. The median knowledge score decreased significantly from \n98% immediately post-training to 74% one year later (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Similarly, OSCE \nperformance declined, with 36% of participants demonstrating proficiency \ncompared to 62% at baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.05). A paired t-test was performed to \nevaluate whether students' psychomotor skills significantly declined 12 months \nafter initial training. The results of the analysis showed a highly significant \ndecline in psychomotor skills during this time, with a mean difference of -2.29 \n(SE\u2009=\u20090.29; p\u2009<\u20090.001). This negative mean difference, with pre-test scores \naveraging 27.59 (SD\u2009=\u20092.78) and post-test scores after 12 months averaging 25.31 \n(SD\u2009=\u20092.11), indicates a noticeable drop in skill levels following training.\nCONCLUSION: While midwives retained moderate knowledge and skills one year after \ncompleting HBB training, significant attrition highlights the need for periodic \nrefresher training and improved access to resuscitation tools. Strengthening \nthese aspects may enhance the long-term impact of HBB in reducing neonatal \nmortality."}

However, a common mechanism that correlates the two diseases \nremains unclear. Here, we have used a bioinformatics approach to understand the \nmolecular network and pathway to predict potentially common genes that can be \ntargeted to prevent these conditions. This study used three online databases and \nclinical datasets on Gene Expression Omnibus.

Murine CAR agonist \n1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) was reported to induce \nhepatomegaly in mice, accompanied by hepatocyte hypertrophy and proliferation. \nHowever, whether CAR activation-induced hepatomegaly is reversible and the \nhistological changes during the reversal process remain elusive. In the current \nstudy, C57BL/6 mice were administered TCPOBOP for 5 days and sacrificed at \ndifferent time points after drug withdrawal. The results showed that \nTCPOBOP-induced hepatomegaly required a long time to reverse, as evidenced by \nthe liver-to-body weight ratio in the TCPOBOP group remaining significantly \nhigher than that in the vehicle group even 120 days after withdrawal. \u03b2-catenin \nand cyclin D1 staining indicated a reduction in hepatocyte size and \nproliferating cells. To investigate the involved mechanisms, we measured \nproteins associated with hepatomegaly and liver regeneration termination. The \nresults suggested that yes-associated protein, C-MYC, \u03b2-catenin, forkhead box \nM1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 changed significantly after TCPOBOP \nwithdrawal and functioned at different stages during reversal. Furthermore, we \nestablished an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry \nmethod to quantify TCPOBOP concentration. The results indicated a long-term \nhepatic retention of TCPOBOP, which constantly activated CAR and led to \nsustained hepatomegaly after TCPOBOP withdrawal. Overall, these findings \nrevealed the reversibility of CAR activation-induced hepatomegaly and provided \nnew insights into the safety of CAR as a drug target. Additionally, the results \nhighlighted the importance of considering long-term TCPOBOP accumulation in the \nliver to avoid potential adverse effects and experimental biases.

Pterostilbene, a natural \nantioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects, has not been extensively studied for \nits potential impact on ageing SG cells. This study aims to investigate the \nprotective effects of pterostilbene on SG function under UV-induced damage and \nits role in collagen repair in UV-exposed fibroblasts.\nMETHODS: To examine the effects of pterostilbene on UVA-induced damage, an \nin\u00a0vitro model of UV-exposed sebocytes was developed. The influence of \npterostilbene on lipid synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and gene \nexpression related to senescence and inflammation was assessed. In parallel, the \neffects of pterostilbene on collagen synthesis (types I and III) and ROS levels \nin UV-exposed fibroblasts were analysed. Super-resolution fluorescence \nmicroscopy was utilized to visualize collagen production and F-actin integrity \nin fibroblasts treated with pterostilbene.\nRESULTS: Pterostilbene increased lipid synthesis by 16% and reduced ROS levels \nby 62.43% in UV-damaged sebocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed \nupregulation of antioxidant genes (Nrf2, Sirt6) and downregulation of \ndifferentiation-related genes (Blimp1, c-Myc). In UV-exposed fibroblasts, \npterostilbene significantly enhanced collagen types I and III levels and reduced \nROS by 40.07%. High-resolution microscopy showed that pterostilbene restored the \ndistribution of F-actin in fibroblasts affected by UVA.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that pterostilbene effectively protects \nagainst UVA-induced damage in both sebocytes and fibroblasts. By promoting lipid \nsynthesis, reducing oxidative stress, and stimulating collagen production, \npterostilbene presents a promising natural ingredient for anti-ageing skincare \nformulations. Its multifunctional mechanisms suggest its potential to enhance \nskin health by supporting sebaceous gland function and improving overall skin \nresilience."}

While traditional histopathology plays a key role in \nLUAD diagnosis, integrating computational pathology with multi-omics analysis \nprovides novel insights into tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics and molecular \nmechanisms. However, the relationship between pathological histological features \nand genomic instability in LUAD remains poorly understood.\nMETHODS: This study employed whole-slide images (WSIs) from the TCGA-LUAD \ndataset, which were processed into image patches for deep learning feature \nextraction using ResNet-50 and pathological feature selection using \nCellProfiler. Copy number variations (CNV) were inferred using inferCNV, and \nhigh-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) was \nperformed to identify key regulatory modules associated with CNV-defined \nmalignant cell populations. Additional analyses included intercellular \ncommunication using CellChat, pseudotime trajectory inference with Monocle2, and \nimmune landscape profiling. Finally, we performed correlation analyses between \nthe gene expression patterns of high-CNV (HCNV) cell lines and pathological \nimage features, followed by prognostic model construction using a machine \nlearning benchmark framework.\nRESULTS: This study first identified LUAD malignant cells with high CNV scores. \nThese cells also exhibited high stemness, and their proportion gradually \nincreases with the progression of LUAD. CNV-driven tumor subpopulations \nexhibited distinct metabolic and immune signatures, with HCNV cells showing \nenhanced glycolysis, MYC signaling, and immune evasion. Intercellular \ncommunication analysis highlighted VEGF, MK and IGF signaling pathways as key \nmediators of HCNV-stroma interactions. A set of 192 imaging features \nsignificantly correlated with CNV burden in LUAD was identified, including 11 \npathological features from CellProfiler and 181 deep learning features from \nResNet-50. Machine learning-based prognostic modeling using deep learning and \npathology features demonstrated robust survival prediction, with high-risk \npatients exhibiting lower immune infiltration and reduced immunotherapy \nresponsiveness.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework \nintegrating computational pathology and single-cell multi-omics to characterize \nLUAD heterogeneity. By identifying CNV-associated imaging features and key \nmolecular regulators, we propose potential biomarkers for prognosis and \ntherapeutic targeting in LUAD. However, as this study is based primarily on \nretrospective bioinformatics analysis, the clinical utility of these findings \nrequires further validation through prospective cohorts and experimental \nstudies. These results lay the groundwork for future translational applications \nbut should be interpreted with caution in the absence of functional validation."}

RNA \nbinding motif single-stranded interacting protein 1 (RBMS1), is known to be \nessential for proliferation and cell cycle progression; however, its role in \npulmonary fibrosis remains to be clarified.This study aimed to systematically \nelucidate the role and underlying mechanism of RBMS1 in pulmonary fibrosis \nutilising mouse primary lung fibroblasts (mPLFs), fibroblast-specific Rbms1 \ndeletion and overexpression mice models, and lung samples from IPF \npatients.RBMS1 was highly expressed in both IPF patient lungs and murine \nbleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrotic lesions. Notably, elevated RBMS1 expression was \nobserved in the cytoplasm of mPLFs following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. Rbms1 promoted \nlung fibroblast activation, while knockdown of Rbms1 mitigated TGF-\u03b21-induced \nfibrogenesis. In vivo, overexpression impaired lung function and exacerbated \npulmonary fibrosis, whereas fibroblast-specific Rbms1 deletion exhibited a \nsignificant reduction in fibrosis post-BLM treatment. Mechanistically, Rbms1 \nbinds to Sumo2 3'UTR, enhancing the mRNA stability. Furthermore, Rbms1 induced \nthe SUMOylation of Smad4, with lysine 158 identified as a critical SUMOylation \nsite. Meanwhile, Sumo2 knockdown alleviated the Rbms1-driven exacerbation of \npulmonary fibrosis.

This study \ndemonstrates that phosphorylated Smad1/5 (pSmad1/5) and Smad4 regulate distinct \ngene sets in dental mesenchyme. Real-time monitoring of BMP-Smad transcriptional \nactivity revealed that Smad4-dependent canonical BMP signaling is restricted to \nneurovascular cells surrounding the condensed dental mesenchymal cells where \npSmad1/5 is present.

Over 300 \nclinical trials targeting TGF\u03b2 have been conducted in unselected patient \ncohorts; however, none of the therapies have gained FDA approval.

In this study, we investigated the \npotential for stratifying patients based on SMAD4 mutational status to identify \ntumors susceptible to TGF\u03b2 inhibition. Analysis of SMAD4 expression in human \npancreatic tumors revealed that SMAD4 mutation or loss is associated with worse \ndisease-free survival. Intriguingly, intratumoral SMAD4 expression displayed \nheterogeneity among human pancreatic cancer samples. SMAD4 deficient genetically \nengineered mouse models and orthotopic SMAD4 knockout tumor models exhibited \nreduced survival, increased metastasis, and alterations in the tumor \nmicroenvironment compared to SMAD4 wildtype controls, consistent with gene and \nprotein expression changes in the absence of functional SMAD4. Importantly, \ntreating mice bearing SMAD4 deficient tumors with a blocking TGF\u03b2 antibody \nreduced tumor weight and improved survival.

Foveolar adenoma is an especially rare entity with an unknown \naetiology. We present a case of duodenal foveolar adenoma with coexisting \nmetaplasia, whole exome sequencing results, and the first literature review.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Hereby we present the case of a 58-year-old man, whose \npolypectomy specimen revealed a lesion composed of mainly foveolar cells with \nlow-grade dysplasia, and was concluded as foveolar adenoma. Due to the \nincomplete resection, polypectomy was repeated, this time foveolar adenoma was \ndiagnosed with high-grade dysplasia. Foveolar differentiation was proved with \nMUC5AC immunohistochemistry, in addition, KRAS and SMAD4 pathogenic mutations \nwere identified.\nDISCUSSION: Duodenal foveolar adenoma remains a controversial and an enigmatic \nentity. Our paper presents such a lesion with first low-grade, then high-grade \ndysplasia, and KRAS mutation, identical to gastric manifestations. The further \nsample of our patient suggests foveolar metaplasia as an aetiological factor \nthat supports the literature data."}

This review delves into the neurobiological mechanisms \nunderlying these deficits, including structural and functional disruptions in \nthe auditory cortex, imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, and \nsynaptic dysfunction. Genetic contributions from mutations in CNTNAP2, SHANK3, \nFMR1, and FOXP2 are explored, highlighting their roles in auditory \nabnormalities. Animal models, such as BTBRT+tf/J mice (BTBR) and valproic acid \n(VPA)-exposed rodents, provide critical insights into the sensory abnormalities \nobserved in ASD. In addition, the review discusses current pharmacological \nstrategies and emerging interventions targeting neurotransmitter systems and \nsynaptic plasticity. Notably, future directions are emphasized, highlighting the \nneed for integrated pharmacological and auditory-specific therapies to enhance \nsensory processing and communication outcomes in ASD. Overall, this review aims \nto bridge the gap between basic neurobiological research and clinical \napplication, guiding future studies and therapeutic developments in ASD-related \nauditory processing deficits."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "FOXP2", "text": "BACKGROUND: Vocal learning is a rare, convergent trait that is fundamental to \nboth human speech and birdsong. The Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) transcription factor \nappears necessary for both types of learned signals, as human mutations in FOXP2 \nresult in speech deficits, and disrupting its expression in zebra finches \nimpairs male-specific song learning. In juvenile and adult male finches, \nstriatal FOXP2 mRNA and protein decline acutely within song-dedicated neurons \nduring singing, indicating that its transcriptional targets are also \nbehaviorally regulated. The identities of these targets in songbirds, and \nwhether they differ across sex, development and/or behavioral conditions, are \nlargely unknown.\nRESULTS: Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing \n(ChIP-Seq) to identify genomic sites bound by FOXP2 in male and female, juvenile \nand adult, and singing and non-singing birds. Our results suggest robust FOXP2 \nbinding concentrated in putative promoter regions of genes. The number of genes \nlikely to be bound by FOXP2 varied across conditions, suggesting specialized \nroles of the candidate targets related to sex, age, and behavioral state. We \ninterrogated these binding targets both bioinformatically, with comparisons to \nprevious studies, and biochemically, with immunohistochemistry using an antibody \nfor a putative target gene. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment for human \nspeech- and language-related functions in males only, consistent with the sexual \ndimorphism of song learning in this species. Fewer such targets were found in \njuveniles relative to adults, suggesting an expansion of this regulatory network \nwith maturation. The fewest speech-related targets were found in the singing \ncondition, consistent with the well-documented singing-driven down-regulation of \nFOXP2 in the songbird striatum.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data provide an initial catalog of the regulatory \nlandscape of FOXP2 in an avian vocal learner, offering dozens of target genes \nfor future study and providing insight into the molecular underpinnings of vocal \nlearning."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "FOXP2", "text": "Polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion is associated with pathogenic protein \naggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. However, long polyQ tracts are also \nfound in many transcription factors (TFs), such as FOXP2, a TF implicated in \nhuman speech. Here, we explore how FOXP2 and other glutamine-rich TFs avoid \nunscheduled assembly. Throughout interphase, DNA binding, irrespective of \nsequence specificity, has a solubilizing effect. During mitosis, multiple \nphosphorylation events promote FOXP2's eviction from chromatin and supplant the \nsolubilizing function of DNA. Further, human-specific amino acid substitutions \nlinked to the evolution of speech map to a mitotic phospho-patch, the \"EVO \npatch,\" and reduce the propensity of the human FOXP2 to assemble. Fusing the \npathogenic form of Huntingtin to either a DNA-binding domain, a phosphomimetic \nvariant of this EVO patch, or a negatively charged peptide is sufficient to \ndiminish assembly formation, suggesting that hijacking mechanisms governing \nsolubility of glutamine-rich TFs may offer new strategies for treatment of polyQ \nexpansion diseases."}

Most genomic research into impaired \nspeech development has so far focused on childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a \nrare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with coordinating \nrapid fine motor sequences that underlie proficient speech. In 2001, pathogenic \nvariants of FOXP2 provided the first molecular genetic accounts of CAS \naetiology. Since then, disruptions in several other genes have been implicated \nin CAS, with a substantial proportion of cases being explained by \nhigh-penetrance variants. However, the genetic architecture underlying other \nspeech-related disorders remains less well understood. Thus, in the present \nstudy, we used systematic DNA sequencing methods to investigate idiopathic \nspeech delay, as characterized by delayed speech development in the absence of a \nmotor speech diagnosis (such as CAS), a language/reading disorder, or \nintellectual disability. We performed genome sequencing in a cohort of 23 \nchildren with a rigorous diagnosis of idiopathic speech delay. For roughly half \nof the sample (ten probands), sufficient DNA was also available for genome \nsequencing in both parents, allowing discovery of de novo variants. In the \nthirteen singleton probands, we focused on identifying loss-of-function and \nlikely damaging missense variants in genes intolerant to such mutations. We \nfound that one speech delay proband carried a pathogenic frameshift deletion in \nSETD1A, a gene previously implicated in a broader variable monogenic syndrome \ncharacterized by global developmental problems including delayed speech and/or \nlanguage development, mild intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, and \nbehavioural and psychiatric symptoms. Of note, pathogenic SETD1A variants have \nbeen independently reported in children with CAS in two separate studies. In \nother probands in our speech delay cohort, likely pathogenic missense variants \nwere identified affecting highly conserved amino acids in key functional domains \nof SPTBN1 and ARF3. Overall, this study expands the phenotype spectrum \nassociated with pathogenic SETD1A variants, to also include idiopathic speech \ndelay without CAS or intellectual disability, and suggests additional novel \npotential candidate genes that may harbour high-penetrance variants that can \ndisrupt speech development."}

The \naim of the study is to review all GWAS studies related to PTSD. In total, 20 \nstudies were included, of which 5 meta-analyses and 9 included war veterans. The \nfunctions of genes and their associations were considered, which included \nsingle-cell polymorphisms in different groups of genes involved in \nembryogenesis, neuron formation, and cell functioning, as well as many DNA \nsequences with non-coding RNA transcribed. The repeatability of the results \nbetween studies and replicative samples was studied. Between the studies, the \nassociations were repeated in the CAMKV, CDHR4, DCC, FAM120A, FOXP2 (3 studies), \nMAD1L1 (3 studies), MAPT, NCAM1, NOS1, SP4, ZMYM4, TCF4 genes. A new large-scale \nstudy with many found associations was considered individually. Studies \nregarding polygenic risk were also studied, and several studies showed genetic \ncomorbidity with anxiety and bipolar disorder. However, the models developed by \nthe authors explain a small percentage of variance and are weakly repeated in \nother samples. It may be possible to solve this problem by using larger samples \nand clearer homogeneous inclusion criteria. Thus, at the moment, there are few \nGWAS studies of PTSD; they are ambiguous and uninformative compared to the same \nstudies for other mental disorders, but they have further potential for \nassessing the risks of developing the disease."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NRAS", "text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited \nresponsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or \nrecurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an \nindolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, \nhighlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, \ntrametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 \n(CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the \nrepurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast \ncancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to \nimprove outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes \nevidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer \ntherapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of \nrapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian \ncancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG \n281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, \nmolecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, \nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, \nand CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer \nprovide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies \ndemonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when \ncombined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 \ninhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the \nresponse to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin \ninhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the \nimportance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and \nendocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade \nserous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited \ntreatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates \nprecise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies \nleveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical \nfor refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National \nComprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients \nwith hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NRAS", "text": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer, and patients with \nNRAS-mutant melanoma face limited treatment options due to the lack of direct \nNRAS inhibitors. This study explores the utilization of antisense \noligonucleotides (ASOs) to directly target NRAS-mRNA for therapeutic approaches.\nMETHODS: We designed and tested NRAS-mRNA-targeting ASOs. Experiments in \nmelanoma cell lines and mouse models assessed effects on cell survival, \napoptosis, and tumor growth. A kinase activity profiling platform identified \ntherapeutically exploitable pathways influenced by NRAS suppression.\nRESULTS: Our research suggests that ASOs do not need to target the mutated NRAS \nsegment to be effective. ASOs designed for the non-mutated NRAS sequence \neliminate NRAS-dependent melanoma cells while sparing NRAS wild-type cells. They \nact independently of subcellular target localization, reduce NRAS-mRNA levels, \ninhibit MAPK signaling, induce apoptosis, and suppress melanoma growth in vitro \nand in vivo. Outcomes of high-throughput kinase activity mapping (HT-KAM) \nindicate a significant dependency between NRAS-mRNA expression and the activity \nof MEK1, FGFR2, and CDK4 kinases. Co-targeting these kinases enhances the \nantiproliferative effect of NRAS ASOs, showing synergy.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight antisense oligonucleotides as a promising \ntherapeutic approach for NRAS-mutant melanoma. By effectively blocking \nNRAS-mRNA, this strategy overcomes challenges posed by the absence of a direct \nsmall molecule inhibitor for NRAS, and may offer new treatment options for \npatients."}
{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NRAS", "text": "Plain Language Summary: Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Some \npeople develop melanoma due to a change (mutation) in their DNA in a gene named \nNRAS. Changes in NRAS lead to cancer growth by causing a protein called NRAS to \nbe continuously active. These patients have limited effective treatment options. \nTherefore, we explored a treatment that can prevent cancer cells from producing \nthe NRAS protein. This treatment effectively killed melanoma cells whilst \nsparing healthy cells and reduced melanoma growth in a mouse model. It also \nenhanced the effect of other cancer medications. Our treatment strategy \ndemonstrates that these people with melanoma could potentially benefit from \nsimilar therapies in the future."}

Pathogenic variants were identified \nusing American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification.\nRESULTS: Among the 35 CRC patients analyzed, 31.4% were < 50 years old and 60% \nwere males. Mutation analysis showed a high prevalence of TP53 mutations in 23 \npatients (65.7%). KRAS mutations were detected in 19 patients (54.3%) Other \nmutations included PIK3CA in 3(8.6%), NRAS in 3(8.6%), EGFR in 3(8.6%), and MET \nin 1(2.9%). Double gene mutation (KRAS and TP53) were observed in 13 (37.1%) and \n(PIK3CA and KRAS) in 2 (5.71%) samples. A triple gene mutations (KRAS, TP53, and \nPIK3CA) were found in 1 (3%) of CRC tumors.

We sought \nto evaluate how these mutations contribute to resistance in patients treated \nwith chemotherapy alone or in combination with cetuximab, and to explore the \nimpact of treatment duration and disease progression on mutation rates. We \nretrospectively collected data from 50 mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS who \nreceived either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with anti-EGFR \ntherapy (cetuximab). Following treatment, tumor samples were recollected through \nsurgery, biopsy, or colonoscopy. The secondary mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, \nand BRAF was determined via an amplification refractory mutation system. Based \non the nature of the chemotherapy regimen and the presence or absence of tumor \nprogression at the time of the second KRAS mutation analysis, patients were \nstratified into three groups: Group A (adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence), \nGroup B (first-line chemotherapy without progression), and Group C (first-line \nchemotherapy with progression). Secondary KRAS mutations were assessed in \nrelation to therapeutic regimens and progression profiles to investigate the \nmechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The overall rate of \nsecondary KRAS mutations was 6.0% (3/50). These mutations were not observed in \npatients treated with chemotherapy alone (0/24), but occurred in 11.5% (3/26) of \npatients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab. Stratification by \ntreatment regimens and tumor progression showed mutation rates of 0% (0/13) in \nGroup A, 0% (0/16) in Group B, and 14.3% (3/21) in Group C. In Group C, the \nmutation rate rose from 0% (0/5) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone to \n18.8% (3/16) in those receiving combination therapy. Furthermore, in patients \nreceiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab of Group B and Group C, longer \nanti-EGFR treatment duration was associated with a higher mutation rate: 5.9% \n(1/17) in those treated for \u2264\u200910\u00a0months versus 25.0% (2/8) in those treated for \n>\u200910\u00a0months. Including one case of secondary BRAF mutation, the cumulative \nmutation rate reached 37.5% (3/8) in patients with prolonged cetuximab exposure. \nThis study innovatively revealed from multiple perspectives that the crucial \nrole of secondary KRAS mutations in the resistance of mCRC patients to EGFR \ntherapy, emphasizes the importance of continuous genomic monitoring, and \nprovides new ideas for future combination targeted therapies."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NRAS", "text": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by \ncharacteristic facies, short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental \ndelay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, \nunusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus \nexcavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and \nocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult \nheight approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in \n50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the \nmost common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic \ncardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or \ndevelop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and \nventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of \nFallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual \ndisability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in \nthe general population.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Noonan is established in a proband with \nsuggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1, \nMRAS, NRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, RASA2, RIT1, RRAS2, SOS1, or SOS2 or either a \nheterozygous variant or biallelic pathogenic variants in LZTR1 identified by \nmolecular genetic testing. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan \nsyndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Cardiovascular anomalies in NS are \nusually treated as in the general population. Developmental disabilities are \naddressed by early intervention programs and individualized education \nstrategies. Treatment for serious bleeding is guided by knowledge of the \nspecific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomaly. Growth hormone (GH) \ntreatment increases growth velocity. Standard treatment for juvenile \nmyelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and other malignancies, feeding difficulties, \nADHD, behavioral problems, cryptorchidism in males, renal anomalies\u00a0/ \nhydronephrosis, strabismus, hearing loss, and Chiari malformation. Surveillance: \nAt each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of nutritional \nstatus in infants and toddlers; monitor for evidence of new neurologic \nmanifestations (chronic headache, neck pain, changes in tone, dizziness, or \nobstructive sleep apnea); monitor developmental progress; assessment of \nbehavioral issues, as age appropriate; skin examination. Annually in childhood \nor as clinically indicated: ophthalmology and audiology evaluations. In children \nage <5 years: if initial cardiac evaluation is normal, at least annual cardiac \nevaluations until age 5 years. In children age >5 years through adulthood, \ncardiac evaluation at least every 5 years, or as clinically indicated. Prior to \nany surgical procedure or in those with clinical bleeding: assessment of \nbleeding history, CBC with differential, and consideration of measurement of \ncoagulation factors. For those with pathogenic PTPN11 or KRAS variants: consider \nphysical examination with assessment of spleen size & CBC every 3-6 months until \nage 5 years to assess for concerns about JMML/malignancy. Agents/circumstances \nto avoid: Aspirin therapy should be avoided because it may exacerbate a bleeding \ndiathesis. Pregnancy management: Consider referral to an adult congenital heart \nprogram for peripartum evaluation and management; consider a hematology referral \nif the affected pregnant woman has a history of bleeding abnormalities and/or \nhas not undergone previous screening for coagulopathy.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: NS is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. \nWhile many individuals with autosomal dominant NS have a de novo pathogenic \nvariant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to \nsibs of a proband with autosomal dominant NS depends on the genetic status of \nthe parents: if a parent is affected, the risk is 50%; when the parents are \nclinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low \n(<1%). Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant NS has a 50% chance \nof inheriting the pathogenic variant. NS caused by pathogenic variants in LZTR1 \ncan be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive \nmanner. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive NS are typically \nheterozygotes (i.e., have one LZTR1 pathogenic variant), and may either be \nasymptomatic or have mild features of NS. If both parents are heterozygous for \none LZTR1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at \nconception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of having one LZTR1 \npathogenic variant (which can be associated with mild NS features), and a 25% \nchance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal testing and \npreimplantation genetic testing are possible if the NS-related pathogenic \nvariant(s) have been identified in an affected family member."}

Compared to children with isolated NRAS \nmutations, those with NRAS compound mutations showed statistically significant \ndifferences in age at onset, platelet count, and fetal hemoglobin proportion \n(P<0.05). Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis revealed that \nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and hepatomegaly (\u22652 cm below the \ncostal margin) were factors affecting the survival rate of JMML children with \nRAS mutations (P<0.05); hepatomegaly was a factor affecting survival in the \nnon-HSCT group (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Children with NRAS compound mutations have a later onset age \ncompared to those with isolated NRAS mutations. At initial diagnosis, children \nwith NRAS compound mutations have poorer peripheral platelet and fetal \nhemoglobin levels than those with isolated NRAS mutations.

Early events \nsuch as chromosomal translocations (e.g. t(4;14)), copy number abnormalities \n(e.g. del(17p), gain(1q)), and driver mutations in KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and DIS3 \npromote clonal evolution.

This review comprehensively examines the genetic, \nepigenetic, and molecular alterations that underlie the initiation and \nprogression of MM and its precursor states, with particular emphasis on the \ninterplay between plasma cell-intrinsic mechanisms and microenvironmental \ninfluences.

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NRAS", "text": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) have a unique molecular profile \ncompared to extracranial metastases (ECM). Description of the biological \nfeatures and clinical outcomes of MBM will facilitate the design of rational \ntherapies.\nMETHODS: We examined the mutational landscape and gene expression profiles of \nMBM (74 patients) and ECM (34 patients) in paired patient samples from a \npreviously published dataset with whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA \nsequencing (RNAseq) data from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We also present \nfindings from MBM from a new cohort of 14 patients from Duke University to \nstrengthen investigation of somatic mutations and gene expression profiles. Gene \nSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to compare paired MBM versus lymph node \n(LN) metastases and skin metastases. Relative immune cell abundance was inferred \nusing deconvolution methods. Survival outcomes from craniotomy and associations \nwith biological features, BRAF mutation status, and PTEN expression were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: GSEA found that autophagy signaling pathways are enriched in MBM versus \nLN and skin metastases. BRAF was the most frequently mutated clinically relevant \ngene in MBM and ECM, with NRAS and PTEN also frequently altered in MBM. The most \nstrongly upregulated genes in autophagy pathways were glial fibrillary acidic \nprotein (GFAP) and hemoglobin beta (HBB). An increased proportion of \nimmune-suppressive M2 compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in MBM and \nECM was identified. There was not sufficient evidence for an association between \nBRAF V600 mutation status or expression and overall survival (OS) from \ncraniotomy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The mutational landscape and gene expression of MBM from the Duke \ncohort resembled those previously reported in the MDACC cohort. Upregulation of \nautophagy pathways was observed in patient-matched MBM versus LN and skin \nmetastases due to upregulation of two genes, GFAP and HBB. In MBM, higher M2:M1 \nratio may contribute to a therapeutically relevant immune-suppressive tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME)."}

Syntaxin4 (STX4) is \nlocalized in the plasma membrane and plays a role in the occurrence, \ndevelopment, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the biological behavior and effects of \nSTX4 gene silencing on the invasion and metastasis of OC cell lines.\nMETHODS: The proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of two groups of OC \ncell lines SK-OV-3 and CAOV-3 constructed with an interfering plasmid \n(pLVX-shRNA1-STX4-shRNA) and a negative control plasmid \n(pLVX-shRNA1-nonspecific-shRNA), were examined via Cell Counting Kit-8, \nTranswell and scratch assays. The EMT markers vimentin and E-cadherin, MMPs \n(MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9) and CCND1 were used to explore the possible molecular \nmechanism of STX4 by which STX4 affects OC cells behavior, after which the \neffect of STX4 gene silencing on the proliferation of OC cells in vivo was \ntested.\nRESULTS: After STX4 silencing, the biological behaviors of ovarian cancer cells \nincluding proliferation, migration and invasion, were significantly weakened. \nThe results revealed that the E-cadherin, MMP2 and CCND1 levels of both OC cell \nlines were decreased after STX4 gene silencing. Animal models of STX4 gene \nsilencing showed the tumorigenicity of tumor cells was reduced.\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrated for the first time that STX4, an important regulator \nof OC progression, was associated with the growth and metastasis of OC cells \nthrough correlations with EMT, MMP2, and CCND1, suggesting its potential as a \nnew therapeutic target for OC."}

The shear bond strength (SBS) of the \nnormal and aged specimens were measured. For the normal and treated specimens, \nthe surface and cross-sectional morphologies were analyzed using scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM), the chemical bond modifications were investigated \nusing X-ray photoelectron and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform \ninfrared spectroscopies (XPS and ATR-FTIR, respectively), the mechanical \nstrengths were measured using three-point bending tests, and the cytotoxicities \nwere evaluated using cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and \n4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining.\nRESULTS: NaBH4 etched the PEEK surface, generating a fibrous texture, while \nconcentrated H2SO4 produced a surface possessing variously sized pores. \nSequential treatment with NaBH4 and concentrated H2SO4 produced dense, \npermeating pores. XPS confirmed that NaBH4 reduced carbonyl groups to hydroxyl \ngroups on the PEEK surface. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that the silane \ncoupling agent grafted onto the PEEK surface, forming Si-O-C bonds. NaBH4 and \nconcentrated H2SO4 both strengthened the shear bonding between the PEEK and both \nthe composite resins and PMMA (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The specimens sequentially treated \nwith NaBH4 and 98% concentrated H2SO4 possessed the strongest shear bonding \n(P\u2009<\u20090.05). The aged specimens sequentially treated with NaBH4 and concentrated \nH2SO4 retained very strong shear bonds. CCK-8 cytotoxicity assays and DAPI \nstaining confirmed that these surface treatments meet oral biocompatibility \nstandards.\nCONCLUSION: NaBH4 introduced chemical bonds to the PEEK surface, while \nconcentrated-H2SO4-induced sulfonation enhanced the micromechanical interlocking \nbetween the PEEK and both the composite resins and PMMA. These combined \nphysicochemical modifications significantly strengthened the adhesion between \nthe PEEK and both the composite resins and PMMA and effectively strengthened \nPEEK's bonding."}

The expression of various proteins engaged in the \nsphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western \nblotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular \ncontent of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced \nthe intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), \nredirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, \nsphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), \nrespectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, \ninhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the \nPI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B \n(Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats. These results \nsuggest that CBG may play an essential homeostatic role in skeletal muscles and \ncan protect from the development of obesity-associated metabolic derangements."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "KIT", "text": "STUDY QUESTION: Which spermatogonial differentiation states are present in \nprepubertal testes under normal conditions and following chemotherapy-induced \ndepletion of spermatogonia in paediatric patients with cancer?\nSUMMARY ANSWER: Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals that only \nundifferentiated spermatogonia are present in prepubertal boys, while \ndifferentiated states emerge during puberty, with reduced protein expression of \nadvanced spermatogonial markers observed in younger patients, those treated with \nalkylating agents, or those with a diminished spermatogonial pool.\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Paediatric oncology treatments often involve gonadotoxic \ntherapies that can impair spermatogonial stem cells, increasing the risk of \nsubfertility. While five distinct spermatogonial subpopulations have been \nidentified in adult testes via single-cell RNA sequencing, their presence in \nprepubertal testes of childhood cancer patients remains to be confirmed through \nmarker protein expression.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Gene expression profiles of spermatogonial \nsubpopulations were investigated using single-cell RNA sequencing data from six \ntesticular samples of healthy boys aged 0-17\u2009years. Protein expression patterns \nwere examined via immunofluorescence staining in 14 biobank control samples \n(median age: 4.9\u2009years; range: 0.6-13.1\u2009years) and in 31 prepubertal testicular \ntissue samples of paediatric patients with cancer (median age: 6.8\u2009years; range: \n0.7-13.1\u2009years).\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Gene expression profiles of UTF1 \n(states 0-1), ID4 (states 0-1), PIWIL4 (states 0-1), FGFR3 (states 0-2), and KIT \n(state 4), were analysed in testicular cells of paediatric origin obtained from \nour previously published open-access data source (GSE134144 and GSE120508). The \nprotein expression of these spermatogonial subpopulation markers was evaluated \nby counting immunofluorescence-positive cells per analysed area. Marker \nexpression was correlated with prior chemotherapy exposure and spermatogonia \nnumbers. Exposure to alkylating agents was quantified as the cumulative \ncyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED), and anthracycline exposure as the \ncumulative doxorubicin isoequivalent dose equivalents (DIE). A depleted \nspermatogonia pool was defined as having S/T Z-scores lower than -7 SD.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that germ \ncells in the prepubertal testis consist solely of undifferentiated \nspermatogonia. The expression of KIT protein, defining differentiated \nspermatogonia, was positively correlated with age (P\u2009<\u20090.001). A reduction in \nthe number of spermatogonia expressing ID4 protein was associated with higher \nCED (P\u2009=\u20090.001), and spermatogonia expressing KIT protein with higher CED and \nDIE exposure (P\u2009=\u20090.005, and P\u2009=\u20090.035, respectively). A depleted spermatogonia \npool (S/T Z-score <-7 SD) correlated with fewer spermatogonia expressing ID4 \n(P\u2009=\u20090.033), FGFR3 (P\u2009=\u20090.050), and KIT (P\u2009=\u20090.051) proteins. These results \nindicate that distinct protein expression patterns were observed following \nchemotherapy-induced reduction of the spermatogonial pool, with reduced \nexpression of ID4, FGFR3, and KIT proteins. Numbers of spermatogonia positive \nfor markers indicating more na\u00efve, undifferentiated states, such as UTF1 and \nPIWIL4, did not correlate with spermatogonial pool reduction.\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study population was heterogeneous in \nterms of age and treatment exposure. Moreover, the impact of specific cancer \ntreatments could not be individually assessed. Limited tissue availability \nreduced the statistical power of the study, and repeated double or triple \nimmunofluorescence staining could not be performed. As a result, the \ncorrelations between the expression of different spermatogonial markers can only \nbe considered indicative trends. Child testicular control tissue samples were \nconsidered normal for inclusion if no testicular pathology was reported. \nHowever, detailed information on prior medical treatments or testicular volumes \nfor the patients in this biobank was unavailable.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our observations suggest that alkylating \nagents have dose-dependent effects on all spermatogonial subpopulations. \nHowever, spermatogonial subtypes expressing the protein markers UTF1 and PIWIL4 \nwere more resistant to chemotherapy-induced depletion of the spermatogonial \npool, potentially representing true reserve stem cells. The identification of \nreserve stem cells could provide a valuable method for evaluating the fertility \npotential of testicular tissue collected for fertility preservation in \nprepubertal and peripubertal boys.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by grants from the \nSwedish Childhood Cancer Fund (PR2019-0123; PR2022-0115; TJ2020-0023) (J.-B.S.), \nFinnish Cancer Society (K.J.), Finnish Foundation for Paediatric Research \n(K.J.), Swedish Research Council (2018-03094; 2021-02107) (J.-B.S.), and \nBirgitta and Carl-Axel Rydbeck's Research Grant for Paediatric Research \n(2020-00348; 2020-00335; 2021-00073; 2022-00317, 2024-00255) (J.-B.S., K.J.). \nY.C. and Y.Y. received a scholarship from the Chinese Scholarship Council.

This study aimed to investigate the \nrole of histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) in NSCLC progression. Western \nblot was performed to detect the protein levels of lactylation and H3K18la. Cell \ncounting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and Transwell migration \nassays were performed to detect the cell viability, proliferation, and \nmigration. The 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake rate, \nlactate content, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were detected by \ncommercial kits. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR was performed to assess the \nrelative H3K18la enrichment on phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) promoter. \nFinally, we established the tumor-bearing mouse model. Results showed that A549 \nand H1299 cells showed increased pan-kla and H3K18la protein levels. Besides, \nsilencing of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inhibited the cell viability, \nproliferation, migration, and glycolysis in A549 and H1299 cells. Animal study \nresults indicated that LDHA inhibition suppressed the tumor growth in xenografts \nmice. Mechanically, LDHA-mediated H3K18la regulated the transcription and \nstability of PTEN in A549 and H1229 cells. Final rescue results demonstrated \nthat PTEN deficiency increased the cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis \nin A549 and H1299 cells. Our study suggested that LDHA-mediated H3K18la promoted \nthe glycolysis in NSCLC through targeting PTEN, which might provide a new \ninsight for NSCLC treatment."}

SLC6A6 expression patterns \nwere mapped using single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative PCR, and \nimmunofluorescence. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A6 with guanidinoethyl \nsulfonate (GES) was applied in corneal wound healing models and murine corneal \nepithelial stem/progenitor (TKE2) cells. Transcriptomic profiling, RNA/protein \nanalyses, and functional assays were performed in GES-treated TKE2 cells. Aged \nmice with corneal epithelium scraping received topical taurine supplementation \n(25 mg/mL, 5 times/day), and the corneas were collected for immunofluorescence \nstaining. Moreover, TKE2 cells were treated with GES along with the Notch1 \nagonist valproic acid (VPA), or they were treated with taurine along with the \nNotch1 inhibitor GSI-IX (DAPT).\nRESULTS: The cornea exhibited high taurine concentrations, with its transporter \nSLC6A6 predominantly localized in LSPCs (limbal stem cells, transient amplifying \ncells, and basal cells) and displaying age-dependent expression patterns. SLC6A6 \ninhibition delayed corneal wound healing, triggered senescence pathway \nactivation and pluripotency suppression, and downregulated stemness markers \n(BCAM, p63, KRT14, Wnt4) and proliferative markers (Ki67), which recapitulated \nkey features of corneal aging. This functional decline was reversed through \ntopical taurine supplementation. Moreover, VPA effectively reversed the \ninhibitory effect of GES, whereas DAPT attenuated the effect of taurine, \nindicating involvement of the Notch1 signaling pathway in taurine-induced LSPC \nmaintenance.\nCONCLUSIONS: SLC6A6-driven taurine uptake critically regulates LSPC homeostasis, \npresenting a therapeutic strategy for age-related corneal disorders."}

This study assessed the \neffects of partially substituting marine fish with fermented BSFL on ASE growth \nperformance, intestinal development, and hepatic health.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 480 ASEs were randomly assigned to four \ndietary groups: control (40% marine fish), BSFL34 (13.4% BSFL), BSFL61 (24.1% \nBSFL), and BSFL82 (32.8% BSFL), replacing marine fish on a dry matter basis. All \ndiets were isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. Fish were reared in net cages for \nover 90 days, and parameters including survival rate, growth metrics, muscle and \nliver histology, intestinal morphology, gene expression (quantitative real-time \npolymerase chain reaction), and inflammatory protein levels (Western blotting) \nwere assessed.\nRESULTS: Survival rate was significantly higher in the BSFL61 group (p < 0.05). \nGrowth performance was not impaired across BSFL-fed groups, although BSFL61 \nshowed reduced body weight compared to BSFL82 (p < 0.05). Muscle fiber size, \nsatellite cell number, and muscle triglyceride (TG) content remained unchanged. \nBSFL82 showed increased hepatic TG accumulation (p < 0.05) and reduced liver \nfibrosis, while BSFL61 exhibited a significantly lower hepatosomatic index and \nincreased fibrosis. Intestinal villus height was reduced in BSFL34 and BSFL61, \nwhile goblet cell density increased in all BSFL groups. Notch1 expression was \nupregulated in BSFL61 and BSFL82, whereas ctnnb1 and wnt5a were downregulated. \nInflammatory markers nuclear factor-kappa B and interleukin-1 beta were elevated \nin BSFL-fed groups, indicating an activated mucosal immune response.\nCONCLUSION: Partial replacement of marine fish with fermented BSFL enhanced ASE \nsurvival, modulated intestinal immunity, and improved mucosal barrier function, \nwithout compromising overall growth performance. However, excessive inclusion \nmay induce hepatic lipid accumulation and affect intestinal morphology. These \nfindings support the use of fermented BSFL as a sustainable aquafeed ingredient, \nthough inclusion levels should be carefully optimized to balance health benefits \nand growth efficiency."}

Here, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) \nas overexpressed in human T-ALL and as a promising therapeutic target for its \ntreatment. To test the effects of ACLY in leukemia progression, we developed an \nisogenic model of NOTCH1-induced Acly conditional knockout leukemia. \nImportantly, we observed intrinsic antileukemic effects upon loss of ACLY, which \nfurther synergized with NOTCH1 inhibition in\u00a0vivo. Metabolomic profiling upon \nACLY loss revealed a metabolic crisis with reduced acetyl-coenzyme A \n(acetyl-CoA) levels and decreased oxygen consumption rate. Gene expression \nprofiling analyses showed that the transcriptional signature of ACLY loss very \nsignificantly correlates with the signature of MYC loss in\u00a0vivo. \nMechanistically, the decrease in acetyl-CoA led to reduced H3K27ac levels in \nMyc, resulting in transcriptional downregulation of Myc and drastically reduced \nMYC protein levels. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ACLY led to reduced \nMYC levels and antileukemic effects in human T-ALL cell lines and \npatient-derived xenografts. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed a \nreciprocal relationship whereby ACLY itself is a direct transcriptional target \nof MYC, thus establishing a feedforward loop that is important for leukemia \nprogression. Overall, our results identified a relevant ACLY-MYC axis and \nunveiled ACLY as a novel promising target for T-ALL treatment."}

Plectin, a cytolinker and a critical \ncomponent of the cell-ECM adhesion complex hemidesmosome (HD), plays an \nimportant role in the regulation of epithelial tissue mechanics, but its \nfunctions in carcinogenesis remain elusive.\nMETHODS: We use cellular and molecular methods and multiple systems, including a \ntwo-dimensional (2-D) esophageal keratinocyte Ca2+-dependent differentiation \nsystem, a three-dimensional (3-D) esophageal keratinocyte organoid system, and \ntissue samples of normal rat and human esophageal stratified squamous epithelium \n(SSE), N-nitroso-N-methylbenzylamine (NMBzA)-induced rat esophageal squamous \ncell carcinoma (ESCC), and human ESCC, to determine the role(s) of plectin in \nregulating SSE homeostasis and ESCC carcinogenesis.\nRESULTS: We show that plectin is ubiquitously expressed in all proliferative and \ndifferentiative cell types in esophageal SSE. However, the localization of \nplectin in different cell types is controlled by plectin crosslinking to \ndifferent macromolecular structures, such as HD, desmosome (DSM), and \ncytoskeletal filaments, and its expression is regulated by the ESCC oncogenic \ndrivers and transcription factors, p63 and/or Notch1. Plectin functions by \ncoupling plectin-associated HD, DSM, and cytoskeletal components together with \nplectin regulators p63 and Notch1, to maintain cell anchorage, \nproliferation/differentiation, and stratification of esophageal SSE tissue \nhomeostasis. Perturbation of plectin expression and localization leads to the \ndisruption of SSE homeostasis and the involvement in ESCC carcinogenesis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Plectin is involved in maintaining SSE homeostasis, and \nmisexpression of plectin through its genetic alterations or transcriptional \ndysregulations perturbs the compositions, stoichiometries, and localizations of \nplectin, HD, DSM, and the cytoskeleton underlying the oncogenic characteristics \nof plectin."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "BRAF", "text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited \nresponsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or \nrecurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an \nindolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, \nhighlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, \ntrametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 \n(CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the \nrepurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast \ncancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to \nimprove outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes \nevidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer \ntherapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of \nrapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian \ncancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG \n281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, \nmolecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, \nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, \nand CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer \nprovide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies \ndemonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when \ncombined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 \ninhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the \nresponse to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin \ninhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the \nimportance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and \nendocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade \nserous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited \ntreatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates \nprecise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies \nleveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical \nfor refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National \nComprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients \nwith hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer."}

In previously treated patients, the \nORR was 46%, median DOR was 16.7 months, median PFS was 9.3 months, median OS \nwas 22.7 months, and the 3-year OS rate was 29%. Overall, the most frequent \ntreatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (52%), diarrhea (44%), \nfatigue (33%), and vomiting (30%). TRAEs led to dose reductions and permanent \ntreatment discontinuations in 25 (26%) and 16 (16%) patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: With longer follow-up, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed durable \nand clinically meaningful antitumor activity, especially in treatment-na\u00efve \npatients, with a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant \nmNSCLC."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "BRAF", "text": "INTRODUCTION: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA) are primary brain tumors \nchallenging to diagnose due to their morphological and molecular overlap with \nother tumors. While DNA methylation profiling (MP) aids pathological \nclassification, it alone may be inconclusive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), \nroutinely performed for lesion assessment, provides valuable information. \nCombining histo-molecular features, MP, and MRI is thus beneficial, particularly \nin cases of diagnostic uncertainty. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed \nMRI features of methylation-confirmed PXAs (mcPXAs) versus tumors with PXA-like \nhistology using WHO 2021 criteria.\nMETHODS: We included 29 adult patients with tumors displaying PXA-suggestive \nhistology, completed MP, and preoperative MRI. Tumors were classified into three \ngroups: mcPXA, histological PXA with methylation-confirmed glioblastoma (mcGBM), \nand other MP-confirmed diagnoses (mcMimic). Clinical and molecular data were \nrecorded.\nRESULTS: All tumors were supratentorial with heterogeneous enhancement. The \nmcGBM group showed significantly more peritumoral edema and hypercellularity \nthan mcPXA (P=0.002 and P=0.023). No significant differences were found in tumor \nlocation, cystic components, or hemorrhagic content. The BRAFV600E mutation \nappeared in 89% of mcPXA, 8% of mcGBM, and 29% of mcMimic cases (P<0.05). Our \ncomposite MRI and molecular score for PXA diagnosis achieved an area under the \ncurve of 0.95, with 95% specificity and 77% sensitivity.\nCONCLUSION: In cases of histological uncertainty, lack of peritumoral edema and \nhypercellularity supports a PXA epigenetic profile. Our specific score could aid \nin challenging cases, though further validation in larger cohorts is warranted."}

Indeterminate thyroid \nnodules (ITNs) complicate diagnosis, coming at the expense of time, money, and \npotentially additional FNA samplings, causing more discomfort for the patients. \nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted ultrasound \ndiagnosis system have demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance and the \npotential to aid in the differentiation of ITNs. This study aims to develop an \nAI classifier that integrates the AI-assisted ultrasound diagnosis system, FNAC, \nand demographic data to enhance the differentiation of benign and malignant \nthyroid nodules, and to compare the diagnostic performance of the models, with a \nfocus on diagnosing ITNs.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present research, 620 thyroid nodules were \ncollected from a single medical center and divided into training and testing \ncohorts (Testing1). We developed five AI models using distinct classification \nalgorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, \nRandom Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine) that integrate demographic data, \ncytological findings, and an AI-assisted ultrasound diagnostic system for \nthyroid nodule assessment. These models underwent prospective validation \n(Testing2, n = 243) to identify the optimal model. A subsequent prospective \nstudy (Testing3) involving 70 thyroid nodules further evaluated the model's \nperformance, where the selected optimal model was compared against FNAC combined \nwith BRAF V600E mutation analysis.\nRESULTS: After validation with the Testing1 and Testing2 cohorts, the Random \nForest (RF) model demonstrated the best overall performance among the five \nclassifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) for the RF model to diagnose thyroid \nnodules was 0.994 in the training cohort, 0.993 in the testing cohort, and 0.977 \nin the prospective data. In addition, for 42 included ITNs in the prospective \ndata, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the RF model were 90.48%, \n89.47%, and 91.30%, respectively. In the Testing 3 cohort, the RF model \ndemonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to both the standalone AI \nultrasound auxiliary diagnostic system and FNAC alone. Its accuracy was \ncomparable to FNAC combined with BRAF V600E mutation analysis. Conclusion: Our \ndeveloped thyroid nodule AI diagnostic model shows favorable predictive value. \nIt can serve as a decision support tool for non-thyroid specialists and assist \nthyroid surgeons in the management of ITN.\nCONCLUSION: Our developed thyroid nodule AI diagnostic model shows favorable \npredictive value.

SLNB and SUVmax (Maximum Standard Unit Value) results \nwere compared.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting \naxillary metastasis was the primary outcome. Interrater reliability testing in \ndetermining the agreement between 18F-FDG PET/CT and SLNB was the secondary \noutcome.\nSAMPLE SIZE: 248.\nRESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET/CT \nfor detecting axillary metastasis were 62%, 92%, 88%, 71% and 77%, respectively. \nCohen's Kappa coefficient (0.54) showed moderate agreement with SLNB (P<.001). \nTumors with positive HER2 gene amplification [HER2 (+) and Luminal B HER2 (+) \nhave higher sensitivity than other subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B HER2 (-) and \ntriple negative). HER2 gene amplification also increases the agreement between \n18F-FDG-PET/CT and SLNB results.\nCONCLUSION: 18F-FDG-PET/CT has a high specificity but low sensitivity for \nipsilateral axillary metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of \nHER2 gene amplification can increase sensitivity and concordance with SLNB.\nLIMITATIONS: Retrospective design and limited number of patients for each \nsubtype."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "ERBB2", "text": "BACKGROUND: Protein kinases play important roles in fundamental biological \nprocesses. Aberrant activities may result in many diseases, thus the detection \nof multiplex kinase activities is important in clinical diagnosis. Recent \nprogress has focused on the mass spectrometric biosensing technique to enable \nhighly sensitive detection of multiplex targets. However, the application of the \ndeveloped methods in multiplex enzyme analysis is greatly challenged due to the \nsubstrate immobilization on solid interfaces, which affect the contact between \nsubstrates and enzymes to reduce enzyme reaction efficiency.\nRESULTS: This work developed a homogeneous mass-encoded method for biosensing of \nmultiplex proteins, which was performed using designed peptides containing the \ncoding sequences and substrate regions. With the assistance of titanium dioxide \ncoated magnetic beads (TiO2-MBs) to capture the phosphopeptide products, \nfollowed by trypsin to cleave the products for releasing the coding sequences, \nthe kinase assays were achieved by submitting the supernatant for ultrahigh \nperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) \nanalysis. Using protein kinase A (PKA) and human epidermal growth factor \nreceptor 2 (HER2) as model targets, the peak area ratios of the coding sequences \nto the internal standards showed linear relations of 1.0-100\u00a0ng\u00a0mL-1 and 0.2-20 \nU\u00a0mL-1, with the detection limits of 0.46\u00a0ng\u00a0mL-1 and 0.033 U\u00a0mL-1 for HER2 and \nPKA, respectively. The proposed strategy also demonstrated great practicability \nin inhibition analysis and kinase activity assays in cell lysates.\nSIGNIFICANCE: A homogeneous mass-encoded method for multiplex detection of \nkinase activities could simplify the assay procedure and reveal the enzyme \nactivities with free substrates. The strategy enabled multiplex kinase activity \nassays with convenience, high sensitivity, and high specificity, demonstrating \npromising applications in clinical fields."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "ERBB2", "text": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) is a \ncommonly over-expressed oncoprotein in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). \nNonetheless, HER2-blocking agents have failed to significantly improve the \noutcome for OAC patients, despite achieving striking clinical success in breast \ncancer. To address this conundrum, we investigated how resistance progressively \nemerges when HER2 is targeted. We discovered that OAC cell lines that are \ncapable of surviving in the presence of the dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor lapatinib exhibit a significant increase in the protein level of \nnuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Indeed, NRF2 knockdown \nenhanced the cytotoxic effect of lapatinib, while increased NRF2 expression in \nOAC cells reduced their sensitivity to HER inhibition. Furthermore, prolonged \noverexpression of NRF2 made OAC cell lines increasingly dependent on NRF2 for \ngrowth. Further analyses indicated that the activation of NRF2-mediated \ntranscription that was associated with lapatinib-induced persistent and \nresistant phenotypes coincided with a subsequent increase in glutathione \nmetabolism. Importantly, lapatinib resistant OAC xenografts become exquisitely \nsensitive to pharmacological inhibition of the NRF2 pathway. Together, these \nfindings highlight a promising therapeutic strategy for treating refractory OAC \nby targeting the NRF2 pathway in combination with receptor tyrosine kinase \ninhibition."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "insulin", "text": "The intestine plays numerous roles in the normal physiology of our body. \nGut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network linking the \ngastrointestinal (GI) tract and central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional \nsystem integrates endocrine, neural, and immune signals, impacting host \nmetabolism and cognition. The gut microbiota, a critical component of the GBA, \nsignificantly impacts gut hormones, neurotransmission, neural development, and \nother components of gut-brain-axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis facilitates \ncommunication via metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and \nneurotransmitters such as dopamine, \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) and serotonin. \nThe microbiota influences gut peptide production, including ghrelin, glucagon \nlike pepetide-1 (GLP-1), serotonin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), thereby \nmodulating nutrient absorption and immune responses. Gut hormones such as \nghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), serotonin (5-HT), \nneurotensin, peptide YY (PYY) and melatonin play key roles in the GBA. These \nhormones play several roles including modulation of appetite and satiety, \nmetabolism of nutrients such as lipid and glucose, insulin and glucagon \nsecretion, and influence on gut inflammation, mood, learning and cognition. The \ninteraction between gut microbiota and these hormones underscores their role in \nmaintaining gut-brain homeostasis.

This review \nsynthesizes current understanding of hormones secreted by the intestine, their \nphysiological effects and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action \nunderlying these effects, with a focus on their roles in the GBA.

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "insulin", "text": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are major concerns \nfor surgical patients. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia \nhave been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are \nincluded in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, \nsince total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive \norgans and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, \ndo these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint \narthroplasty surgery?\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative \ncarbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data \nwas collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 \npatients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed \nother short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating \nscale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse \nevents (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included \nindependent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical \ndata. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the \npotential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups.\nRESULTS: Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared \nwith the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we \nfound that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a \nsignificant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI \u2265 30. Among secondary \noutcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved \npostoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital \nstay.\nCONCLUSION: Although the combination of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and \nmultimodal analgesia did not show broad effectiveness in reducing PONV after \nTKA, it offered significant benefits for obese patients by reducing insulin \nresistance and decreasing PONV. Additionally, it demonstrated notable \neffectiveness in pain control, which significantly shortened the length of \nhospital stay."}

The expression of various proteins engaged in the \nsphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western \nblotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular \ncontent of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced \nthe intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), \nredirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, \nsphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), \nrespectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, \ninhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the \nPI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B \n(Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats. These results \nsuggest that CBG may play an essential homeostatic role in skeletal muscles and \ncan protect from the development of obesity-associated metabolic derangements."}

However, limited research exists on \npostoperative hypotension in NPC patients undergoing endoscopic surgery. This \nretrospective study aimed to analyze the risk factors associated with \npostoperative hypotension in such patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This \nretrospective study included NPC patients who underwent endoscopic surgery after \nradiotherapy at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between 2021 and 2023. \nPatients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure \n(MAP) <65 mmHg were categorized into the hypotension group. Multiple logistic \nregression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with \npostoperative hypotension. RESULTS Among 264 patients, 86 (32.5%) experienced \npostoperative hypotension. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations \nbetween postoperative hypotension and factors such as sex, height, weight, \nadmission SBP, admission MAP, preoperative hemoglobin level, and preoperative \nblood calcium level. Multivariate logistic regression identified height [odds \nratio (OR): 0.957; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.924-0.991], admission SBP \n(OR: 0.979; 95% CI: 0.963-0.995), preoperative blood calcium concentration (OR: \n0.044; 95% CI: 0.003-0.734), and the use of dexmedetomidine during surgery (OR: \n0.278; 95% CI: 0.091-0.848) as independent risk factors for postoperative \nhypotension.

Recently, hemoglobin and anemia have \nreceived more attention as predictors of maternal obesity. No such study exists \nin Rwanda. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the \nfactors associated with obesity, including hemoglobin and anemia, among pregnant \nwomen in Kigali, Rwanda.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals in Kigali, \nRwanda, from June to August 2024. A questionnaire was used to collect \nsociodemographic data. Weight, height, and hemoglobin were measured using \nstandard procedures. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: A total of 445 pregnant women were recruited. The median (interquartile \nrange [IQR]) age and parity were 30.0 (26.0\u201235.0) years and 1 (0\u20123), \nrespectively. Of the 445 women, 143 (32.1%), 249 (56.0%), and 53 (11.9%) were of \nnormal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. One hundred and seven \n(24.0%) pregnant women had anemia. In multivariate multinomial regression, no \nsignificant association was found between age, parity, residency, education, \nmaternal occupation, hemoglobin level, anemia, and overweight status. Being from \nrural areas (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u2009=\u20092.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] \n1.16\u20125.56) and being a housewife (AOR\u2009=\u20094.34, 95% 1.42\u201213.26) were significantly \nassociated with obesity. While an increase in hemoglobin level was associated \nwith obesity (AOR\u2009=\u20091.28, 95% CI 1.02\u20121.60), anemia was inversely negatively \nassociated with obesity (AOR\u2009=\u20090.33, 95% CI 0.12\u20120.93).\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that 12% of the pregnant women in Rwanda were \nobese. Hemoglobin and anemia are associated with maternal obesity in Rwanda. \nThere is a need for more efforts in nutritional programs targeting pregnant \nwomen to combat maternal obesity in Rwanda. Future research is recommended to \nexplore the impact of maternal obesity on maternal and perinatal health."}

The study \naim was to investigate the distinct hemodynamic responses that occur at the \nprefrontal cortex (PFC) during yoga poses and PNF.\nMETHODS: Sixteen healthy young volunteers, aged 20-28 years, participated in two \nrandomly assigned sessions, i.e., nine testing rounds of PNF stretching and yoga \npostures, conducted on two consecutive days. To ensure uniformity in the \nsessions, each volunteer underwent a 30-day orientation of both PNF stretching \nand yoga postures prior to the testing rounds. We used functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy to record the blood flow responses of the right and left PFC at \nrest, during nine practice epochs, and after practice.

The results demonstrated improved PFC \nHbO from pre to during session (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both PNF and yoga sessions. \nHowever, there was a more rapid change in HbR during the PNF sessions compared \nto yoga.\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that yoga practice helps to maintain better \noxygenation levels and may prevent rapid deoxygenation, which can indicate less \nfatigue or stress on the brain. In contrast, the rapid deoxygenation seen during \nPNF sessions could be associated with increased muscular effort and fatigue, \nleading to lower oxygen retention in the prefrontal cortex."}

Early achievement of glycaemic control is of prime importance in such \ncases, and many guidelines recommend starting insulin together with oral \nanti-diabetic drugs (OAD) as part of discharge medications. However, large \nnumbers of treatment-na\u00efve patients are hesitant to use insulin due to various \nfactors.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre, observational study, we compared \nthe hbA1c at 1-year follow-up between newly diagnosed DM patients with initial \nhbA1c >\u200910% who were discharged on insulin plus OAD versus those only on OAD \nafter admission with ACS. Pairwise comparisons between continuous and \ncategorical study variables were performed using t-test, Mann-Whitney test, and \nchi-square. We used STATA 18 for analysis. Baseline characteristics have been \ndescribed for all the patients included in the study. In the analysis of \noutcomes at follow-up, only patients who had follow-up at 1-year were included.\nRESULTS: Of 149 patients eligible for inclusion, the majority were males \n(97.3%). The mean age was 47\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3\u2009years. The baseline hbA1c at diagnosis was \n11.2 (10.5-12.3) %. 38 (25.5%) Were Discharged on insulin + OADs, whereas 111 \n(75.5%) Were Discharged Only on OADs. There was no statistically significant \ndifference in change in hbA1c from baseline between the two groups (Mean (SD) \n4.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8% vs. 4%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.07). None of the patients had any \nhyperglycaemic emergency, and there were no differences in recurrent admissions \ndue to cardiac indications (p\u2009=\u20090.5).\nCONCLUSION: An anti-DM regimen consisting of multiple oral agents is a safe and \neffective alternative to insulin plus OAD and can lead to a comparable reduction \nin hbA1c at 1-year in patients who are not willing to use insulin early after \ndiagnosis of T2DM."}

Energy (kcal/d) and \nmacronutrient intakes (energy%) were computed from the semi-quantitative Ghana \nFood Propensity Questionnaire. A low-carb diet score (0-30 points) was \ncalculated as the sum of 0-10 points for 11 strata of carbohydrate, protein and \nfat intakes, respectively. For the associations with ln-transformed HbA1c, we \ncalculated multiple-adjusted beta coefficients, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), \nand p-values by linear regressions and stratified by T2DM status. Among \nparticipants with T2DM, multiple-adjusted odds ratios (OR), 95% CIs, and \np-values were computed by logistic regression for the associations of the \nlow-carb diet score with microvascular and macrovascular complications.\nRESULTS: Neither macronutrient intakes nor the low-carb diet score were \nassociated with ln (HbA1c) among individuals with T2DM. Among individuals \nwithout T2DM, the corresponding associations were statistically significant with \nmarginal beta coefficients between|0.01| and|0.04|. Regarding diabetes \ncomplications, we observed an inverse association of the low-carb diet score \nwith self-reported stroke (adjusted OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99).\nCONCLUSION: Using a low-carb diet score, our results from this Ghanaian study \npopulation do neither support the hypothesis that low-carb diets improve blood \nglucose control, nor that low-carb diets are associated with diabetes \ncomplications."}

This study \naims to compare perioperative blood loss between tourniquet-assisted and \ntourniquet-free TKA using the reference change value (RCV), a personalized \nanalytical tool that accounts for both biological and analytical variability.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 137 patients \n(tourniquet group (n\u2009=\u200968) and non-tourniquet group (n\u2009=\u200969) who underwent \nprimary TKA. Hematological parameters-including red blood cell count (RBC), \nhemoglobin (HGB), and hematocrit (HCT)-were evaluated preoperatively, on the day \nof surgery, and on postoperative day one. Blood loss was assessed using both \nconventional statistical methods and RCV-based analysis.\nRESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the two \ngroups in terms of age and gender (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Although preoperative hemoglobin \nlevels were significantly different between groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05), there were no \nsignificant intergroup differences in pre- or postoperative RBC and HCT values. \nTraditional statistical analysis showed no significant difference in blood loss \n(p\u2009>\u20090.05). However, RCV analysis revealed that while bleeding had stabilized by \nthe first postoperative day in the non-tourniquet group, it remained \nsignificantly elevated in the tourniquet group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that RCV offers a more individualized and \nsensitive approach to assessing perioperative blood loss in TKA. Although \nconventional methods did not demonstrate significant differences, RCV analysis \nindicated a more rapid hemostatic response in the non-tourniquet group. \nIncorporating RCV into routine clinical practice may enhance patient-specific \nblood management and support earlier postoperative decision making."}

At baseline \nand after three months of intervention, anthropometric measurements were \nmeasured, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of blood \nglucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, hs-CRP, fetuin-A, and \nsirtuin 1. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for normally distributed \ndata. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank and the Kruskal-Wallis tests were used \nto analyze non-normally distributed data.\nRESULTS: Three months after the intervention, when the three groups were \ncompared, no significant differences were found regarding weight, body mass \nindex, fasting blood glucose, two-hour postprandial glucose (2\u00a0h-PPG), and HbA1c \n(p\u2009>\u20050.05). Compared to placebo, significant decreases were observed in total \ncholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \n(LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), very-low-density \nlipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), coronary risk index (CRI), atherogenic index \n(AI), and hs-CRP and increasing sirtuin 1 in the fenofibrate (p\u2009<\u20050.001) and \ncurcumin (p\u2009<\u20050.05) groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels \nin the fenofibrate group were found to be significantly higher than in the \nplacebo group (p\u2009<\u20050.001). Furthermore, when compared to curcumin, fenofibrate \nsignificantly reduced waist circumferences and fetuin-A and increased sirtuin 1 \n(p\u2009<\u20050.05).\nCONCLUSION: Both fenofibrate and curcumin are effective at decreasing lipid \nprofiles and improving inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes. \nFenofibrate might have a superior effect in reducing waist circumference, \ndecreasing fetuin-A, and increasing sirtuin 1.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered (August 27, 2020) on clinical \ntrial.gov with an identification code NCT04528212. https://www.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov/study/NCT04528212 ."}

This study aims to \nassess the predictive value of liver enzymes, particularly transaminases, on \nlong-term outcomes in patients with hepatic WD using data from the Spanish \nWilson Registry.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed data from 162 WD patients with hepatic \ninvolvement and over one year of follow-up. Patients were classified as mild (no \ncirrhosis) or severe (with cirrhosis) at diagnosis. An \"unstable pattern of \ntransaminases\" was defined as recurrent AST or ALT elevations. Unfavourable \noutcomes included new cirrhosis, elastography progression\u2009>\u20092\u00a0Kpa, liver \ntransplant, or liver-related deaths. Logistic regression models were used to \nevaluate the impact of various factors on disease outcome.\nRESULTS: Of 162 patients, 81.5% had mild disease at diagnosis. Most received \nchelators as first-line therapy, achieving an 81.4% one-year biochemical \nresponse. After a median follow-up of 17\u00a0years, 59% exhibited an unstable \ntransaminase pattern, and 29% had an unfavourable outcome. Key factors \nassociated with poor outcome included older age at diagnosis (OR\u2009=\u20091.03), lack \nof early biochemical response (OR\u2009=\u20090.19), advanced disease markers (platelet \ncount, albumin), and an unstable transaminase pattern (OR\u2009=\u20092.92). Transaminase \nlevels did not predict outcomes based on initial disease severity. Even patients \nwith mild disease at diagnosis and persistently normal transaminases could \nexperience progression over time, underscoring the need for more thorough \nfollow-up evaluations.\nCONCLUSION: While transaminases are valuable for monitoring WD, they should be \nused alongside other biomarkers to better predict disease progression."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "albumin", "text": "The transplacental transfer of xenobiotics, particularly in an enantioselective \nmanner, is a critical and evolving area of developmental toxicology. Pregnant \nwomen, as a highly vulnerable population, are frequently exposed to pervasive \nchiral chemicals that can cross the placenta, with the placenta serving as an \nenantioselective barrier. Despite significant research on enantioselective \ntransfer of xenobiotics using various models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro), a \ncomprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of xenobiotics-plasma \nprotein binding remains lacking. This review provides a state-of-the-art \nsynthesis of the characteristics and mechanisms governing the enantioselective \ntransplacental transfer of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial \nadditives-representative chiral xenobiotics of significant public health \nconcern. We highlight how xenobiotics, acting as ligands, interact with \nproteins, influencing enantioselective transfer through key processes such as \nplasma protein binding, transporter-mediated biotransport, and enzyme-catalyzed \nbiotransformation. Notably, the binding of xenobiotics to human serum albumin \n(HSA) rather than \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is shown to primarily inhibit the \ntransmembrane transport of small molecules. Whereas limited docking studies \nsuggest Sudlow site II as a pivotal site for enantioselective binding. \nAdditionally, P-glycoprotein (permeability glycoprotein, P-gp) and cytochrome \nP450 (CYP450) are important in determining the enantiomeric distribution between \nmaternal and fetus. Pathological conditions may also modify transplacental \ntransfer efficiencies (TTEs). Future research employing advanced techniques, \nsuch as isotopic tracing, affinity chromatography, high-resolution screening, \nand machine learning, will be essential to further elucidate enantiomeric \ntransport mechanisms and their implications for fetal development."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "albumin", "text": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung \ndisease with a poor prognosis. Nintedanib, an antifibrotic agent, has been shown \nin clinical trials to slow the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) and reduce \nacute exacerbations (AE-IPF). Long-term studies confirm its continued \neffectiveness, though side effects like diarrhea may affect adherence. Despite \nreal-world data supporting nintedanib's benefits, no prospective study has \nassessed its efficacy in early-stage IPF. This study evaluated the efficacy, \nsafety, and tolerability of nintedanib in patients with early-stage IPF to \nassess its effectiveness outside randomized control trials.\nMETHODS: A 1-year interim analysis of a prospective, multicenter observational \nstudy was conducted in Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan. This study included 215 \npatients with early-stage IPF (stage I/II per the Japanese IPF severity system) \nwho were followed up for 52 weeks. Changes in FVC and diffusion capacity of \ncarbon monoxide (DLco); incidence of adverse events, acute exacerbations, and \ndeath; and factors associated with FVC decline and nintedanib discontinuation \nwere evaluated.\nRESULTS: The percentage of predicted FVC (%FVC) remained stable, from 83.2% at \nbaseline to 83.7% at 52 weeks, while %DLco decreased from 70.8% to 64.2%. \nIncidences of acute exacerbation and death were both 4.7%. Nintedanib was \ndiscontinued due to adverse events in 21.9% of the patients. Risk factors for \nFVC decline (>5%) included female sex, GAP stage II/III, low oxygen saturation \n(SpO2) in the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), and elevated biomarkers (KL-6). \nSignificant factors for nintedanib discontinuation were advanced age, modified \nMedical Research Council (mMRC) grade I or higher, GAP stage II/III, low %FVC, \nlow SpO2 in the 6 MWT, short 6 MWT distance, and low albumin levels.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this interim analysis indicate that nintedanib has \ngood efficacy, safety, and tolerability for early-stage IPF in real-world \nsettings, outside randomized control trials."}

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 31\u202fU/L, aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) was 35\u202fU/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 175\u202fU/L. The \npatient had a five-year history of recurrent episodes, previously resolving \nspontaneously or with medical treatment. Following liver biopsy diagnosis and \nfailure of conventional therapy, she underwent plasmapheresis on alternate days. \nFour sessions of one plasma volume exchange, using albumin, were performed \nconcurrently with medical treatment. The patient demonstrated rapid and \nsignificant improvement in pruritus and urine color, with no adverse events or \nneed for fresh frozen plasma. Total bilirubin decreased progressively to \n5\u202fmg/dL, and direct bilirubin to 4\u202fmg/dL.\nCONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis appears to be a beneficial adjunct therapy for \nrefractory BRIC, effectively reducing bilirubin levels and alleviating pruritus. \nThis intervention may improve patient quality of life and potentially prevent \nrenal complications associated with hyperbilirubinemia, serving as a bridge to \nliver transplantation, if necessary."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "albumin", "text": "BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) accounts for 3\u202f% of \nall brain tumors worldwide and high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is used as the \nfrontline chemotherapy. Given the renal excretion of methotrexate, we aimed to \nidentify risk factors for HD-MTX-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients \nwith PCNSL. A comprehensive retrospective cohort study was conducted on newly \ndiagnosed PCNSL patients who received HD-MTX chemotherapy.\nMETHODS: Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were \ncollected at diagnosis and prior to each chemotherapy cycle. Serum methotrexate \nlevels were measured at 24-48, 48-72, and 72-96\u202fh post-infusion. Generalized \nestimating equations were used to identify risk factors for AKI. Among 146 \npatients with PCNSL, 108 received HD-MTX-based regimens, comprising 576 \ntreatment cycles.\nRESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that male gender, serum MTX levels \n\u22652\u202f\u03bcmol/L at 48-72\u202fh post-infusion, fluid accumulation in third spaces, low \nserum albumin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine \n\u22652.0\u202fmg/dL were all associated with increased AKI risk. In multivariate \nanalysis, serum MTX levels \u22652\u202f\u03bcmol/L and fluid accumulation in third spaces \nremained significant risk factors for AKI. Notably, none of the comorbidities \nwere associated with the incidence of AKI.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that third-space fluid accumulation and \nelevated serum methotrexate levels at 48-72\u202fh post-infusion are significant \nindependent predictors of AKI in PCNSL patients receiving HD-MTX.

Fenofibrate and curcumin were found to be effective in \nimproving hyperlipidemia in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate \nthe effect of adding fenofibrate versus curcumin on weight, glycemic status, \nlipids profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fetuin-A, and \nsirtuin 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with glimepiride.\nMETHOD: In a double-blind, randomized control trial, 60 patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus were randomly assigned into three groups: Group I was given \nplacebo; Group II curcumin 1100\u00a0mg; Group III fenofibrate 160\u00a0mg (each \nadministered orally once daily) to ongoing glimepiride 4\u00a0mg therapy administered \norally once daily for three months. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients \naged 35-70\u00a0years, those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and \nthose treated with glimepiride 4\u00a0mg. Exclusion criteria were as follows: other \ntypes of diabetes, pregnancy, abnormal liver or kidney function tests, using \nother anti-diabetes medications, and non-adherence to medications. At baseline \nand after three months of intervention, anthropometric measurements were \nmeasured, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of blood \nglucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, hs-CRP, fetuin-A, and \nsirtuin 1. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for normally distributed \ndata. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank and the Kruskal-Wallis tests were used \nto analyze non-normally distributed data.\nRESULTS: Three months after the intervention, when the three groups were \ncompared, no significant differences were found regarding weight, body mass \nindex, fasting blood glucose, two-hour postprandial glucose (2\u00a0h-PPG), and HbA1c \n(p\u2009>\u20050.05). Compared to placebo, significant decreases were observed in total \ncholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \n(LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), very-low-density \nlipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), coronary risk index (CRI), atherogenic index \n(AI), and hs-CRP and increasing sirtuin 1 in the fenofibrate (p\u2009<\u20050.001) and \ncurcumin (p\u2009<\u20050.05) groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels \nin the fenofibrate group were found to be significantly higher than in the \nplacebo group (p\u2009<\u20050.001). Furthermore, when compared to curcumin, fenofibrate \nsignificantly reduced waist circumferences and fetuin-A and increased sirtuin 1 \n(p\u2009<\u20050.05).\nCONCLUSION: Both fenofibrate and curcumin are effective at decreasing lipid \nprofiles and improving inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes. \nFenofibrate might have a superior effect in reducing waist circumference, \ndecreasing fetuin-A, and increasing sirtuin 1.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered (August 27, 2020) on clinical \ntrial.gov with an identification code NCT04528212. https://www.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov/study/NCT04528212 ."}

Among the myriad of changes driven by \nage and sex, alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly \ncollagen influence myocardial health in aging. Collagen, the predominant ECM \nprotein, upholds tissue integrity and function through tightly regulated \nprocesses. Aging, a significant cardiovascular risk factor, is linked to \nincreased collagen deposition, left ventricular remodelling, and fibrosis. \nSimilarly, sex differences affect cardiovascular disease progression, with \nnotable variations in the deposition of collagen types I and III between males \nand females. While collagen accumulation is present in aging in both sexes, \nfemales exhibit a tempered response until menopause, primarily due to \noestrogen-mediated suppression of excessive collagen remodelling. This review \nfocuses on the mechanisms underlying age- and sex-related changes in cardiac \ncollagen metabolism and their implications for myocardial health. \nAging-associated fibrosis and collagen accumulation appear mechanistically \ndistinct from those seen with injury or dysfunction, occurring without increased \ncollagen synthesis despite elevated degradation enzymes. Factors such as \nsenescence, inflammation, oxidative stress, and enhanced ECM crosslinking are \nidentified as key drivers of these metabolic shifts. While studies in \novariectomized rodent models have highlighted the role of sex in collagen \nmetabolism, evidence suggests that aging exerts a more dominant influence \noverall. Additionally, this review emphasizes a critical gap in the field: the \nlimited availability of longitudinal aging fibrosis studies that include both \nsexes. This scarcity hampers a comprehensive understanding of how aging and sex \ncollectively shape collagen turnover and myocardial health.

Standard diet syngeneic C57BL/6 mice of the same age were used for \nthe control group. The drug-treated groups received high-dose and low-dose XFZY \nvia continuous intragastric administration in atherosclerotic mice. The \nconcentrations of the inflammatory factors were measured. The lipid deposition, \npathological changes and collagen expression in the thoracic aorta wall were \ndetected. The levels of expression of CD36, ABCA1, SR-A1, and ABCG1 were \nquantified within the thoracic aorta tissue.\nRESULTS: In the XFZY-treated group, a notable decline was observed in serum \nlipid levels, as well as in the concentrations of inflammatory factors. This \nreduction was accompanied by a decrease in the accumulation of lipids within the \nwall of the thoracic aorta. The XFZY treatment leaded in a decrease in the \nexpression value of collagen I and III within the thoracic aorta. Pathological \nexamination of the thoracic aorta indicated alleviation of atherosclerotic \nlesions. Intriguingly, The study observed a downregulation of SR-A1 and CD36 \nexpression, accompanied by an upregulation of ABCG1 and ABCA1 in \natherosclerosis-induced mice models.\nCONCLUSION: XFZY exerts an anti-atherosclerotic effect not only by reducing \nserum lipid and inflammatory levels but also by decreasing thoracic aortic lipid \ndeposition, repairing endothelial injury, and stabilizing atherosclerotic \nplaques. The underlying process might deal with an augmentation in cholesterol \nefflux and the facilitation of reverse cholesterol transport."}

The collected \ntissue was exposed to collagenase type II for 16-24\u00a0h for chondrocyte isolation. \nIsolated cells were counted and seeded onto T-25 flasks in DMEM supplemented \nwith 10% FBS. Media was changed every three days until >\u200990% confluency. At \nconfluency, cells were counted and seeded onto a T-175 flask representing \npassage one. At second confluency, cells were counted again; if the total did \nnot surpass 20,000,000 cells based on the minimum number needed for cell-based \ntreatments, they were seeded onto two T-175 flasks representing passage two. \nCells were not expanded beyond passage two based on the goal of phenotype \nmaintenance.\nRESULTS: Mean weight of collected tissues was 209.69\u2009\u00b1\u200978.09\u00a0mg \n(median\u2009=\u2009202\u00a0mg). 41 of 55 samples reached\u2009>\u200920,000,000 cells at a mean of \n33.98\u2009\u00b1\u200913.06 days (median\u2009=\u200930 days).

Eliminating \npro-inflammatory M1 macrophages is a promising strategy for RA treatment, but is \nimpeded by cytoprotective autophagy. Herein, we report an effective autophagy \nblockage-promoted apoptosis/ferroptosis strategy using multifunctional ferric \nphosphate-decorated, methotrexate-loaded polypyrrole nanoparticles (PPy-FePi-MTX \nNPs) to achieve enhanced RA treatment effects. When injected into the knee \njoints of a collagen-induced DBA/1J mouse model of RA, the payloads on PPy NPs \nare released under the stimulation of an inflammatory microenvironment. The \nreleased MTX can directly induce M1 macrophage apoptosis. Upon near-infrared \nlaser irradiation, the photothermal effect of PPy NPs further promotes cellular \napoptosis. In addition, Fe3+ reacts with intracellular over-expressed \nglutathione to form Fe2+, which can convert hydrogen peroxide into toxic \nhydroxyl radicals. This redox process could deplete glutathione, inactivate \nglutathione peroxidase 4, and cause lipid peroxidation accumulation, resulting \nin ferroptosis of inflammatory M1 macrophages. Furthermore, PO43- disrupts the \nnormal function of lysosomes by pH disturbance, disabling the cytoprotective \nautophagy of M1 macrophages for enhanced anti-RA effects.

The data obtained \nwere analyzed using a Bayesian regression model in the R software.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that the expression of P35 gene, of the two \nsubunits of IL-35, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, \nEbi3 and IL-37 transcript levels were significantly lower in patients compared \nto healthy individuals (p<0.001). In contrast, IL-35 serum level in patients \nshowed a significant increase compared to the control group (p=0.016). Notably, \nIL-37 expression showed a negative correlation with age (p=0.004). . We also \nobserved positive and significant correlations between the gene expression of \nP35 and Ebi3 (p= 0.02, r= 0.4), P35 and IL-37 (p= 0.008, r= 0.45), and Ebi3 and \nIL-37 (p= 0.016, r= 0.41).\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study revealed a higher serum protein level of \nIL-35 in PD patients compared to the healthy control group.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) \nbetween the IPF and control groups were initially identified through \ndifferential expression analysis. Subsequently, key module genes closely \nassociated with IPF samples were selected using Weighted Gene Co-expression \nNetwork Analysis (WGCNA). Intersection genes 1 and 2 were then identified by \noverlapping DEGs with key module genes, MRGs, and PCDRGs. Candidate genes were \nfurther selected through Spearman correlation analysis involving intersection \ngenes 1 and 2. Additionally, biomarkers were identified, and a risk model was \ndeveloped using Cox regression analysis, proportional hazards (PH) assumption \ntesting, and machine learning methods. Patients with IPF were stratified into \nhigh- and low-risk cohorts. Finally, functional enrichment analysis, immune \ninfiltration analysis, regulatory network construction, and reverse \ntranscription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were conducted separately to validate \nthe findings.\nRESULTS: CD28 and PF4 were identified as biomarkers, and a risk model was \nestablished. The distinct risk cohorts exhibited differences in pathways related \nto hemostasis, prion diseases, and other biological processes. A significant \npositive correlation with was observed between CD28 and native CD4 T cells, \nwhile PF4 showed a negative correlation with activated NK cells. Based on these \ntwo biomarkers, 30 miRNAs and 532 lncRNAs were predicted, resulting in the \nconstruction of a lncRNA-miRNA-biomarker network. Additionally, 11 chemicals \nassociated with these biomarkers were identified.

The molecular \nand cellular mechanisms of the disease are unclear and their study is one of the \ngreatest challenges for the modern science. Since the lung is the biggest target \nfor SARS-CoV-2, the studies on cellular and molecular changes in this organ are \nessential to establish the pathogenesis of the disease. To date there is \nincreasing number of reports on the lung pathology of fatal COVID-19 and the \nresults are mainly obtained by autopsies of elderly patients, since this age \ngroup shows highest mortality. Little is known about the progression of the \ndisease in children and especially newborn and infants and, to our knowledge, \nthere are no reports on the lung features of fatal COVID-19 in this age group.\nMETHODS: In the present case study, we have investigated the lung morphological \nfeatures in 11-months old infant who has died as a result of complications from \nCOVID-19. Immunohistochemistry for immune cell markers and transmission electron \nmicroscopy for alveolocytes type II (ATII) are made.\nRESULTS: Immediate cause of the death was acute respiratory failure resulting \nfrom bilateral interstitial pneumonia and subsequent acute cardiovascular \nfailure. The histopathology shows lung edema, hyaline membranes, airway mucus \nplugging and interstitial inflammation. On cellular level we have observed a \nsubstantial increase in the number of ATII cells. ATII cells were marked with \ncytokeratin 19, TTF1 and napsin A. Transmission elec-tron microscopy reveals \nongoing apoptosis in these cells with a typical chromatin clustering and \ncondensation towards the inner nuclear membrane. Immunohisto-chemistry shows \nsignificant increase of CD68+ macro-phages in the alveoli, increase of IL-6 in \nimmune and stromal cells, moderate elevation of FOXP3+ and IL-17+ cells and \nexpression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in alveolar walls. Immune cell interactions \nare discussed in the sense of ongoing cytokine storm.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the complexity of COVID-19 lung affection, \ninvolving ATII cell hyperplasia, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and \nmacrophages increase. The findings provide an additional knowledge on the \npathophysiology of COVID-19 in the lung and can serve as a basis for \ninvestigation of molecular mechanisms of this disease."}

Understanding its underlying \nmechanisms is crucial for developing effective interventions.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate whether keratinocyte necroptosis contributes to RIOM \npathogenesis and evaluate the effects of RIPK3/MLKL inhibition.\nMETHODS: A mouse model of RIOM was established with varying irradiation doses. \nTongue tissues were analyzed via histological staining, immunohistochemistry, \nand Western blot. In vitro, keratinocytes were irradiated and treated with RIPK3 \nor MLKL inhibitors. Subsequently, cell viability, necroptosis, and inflammatory \ncytokine expression were assessed using CCK-8, LDH release, Western blot, flow \ncytometry and RT-qPCR.\nRESULTS: In irradiated mouse tongues, p-RIPK3/RIPK3 and p-MLKL/MLKL ratios were \nsignificantly elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.01), accompanied by heightened expression levels \nof IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Similar findings were observed in keratinocytes, which, after \n12\u00a0Gy irradiation for 2.5 days, reduced cell viability (P\u2009<\u20090.001), enhanced \nnecroptotic marker expression (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and increased inflammatory cytokine \nlevels (P\u2009<\u20090.001).

This study investigated whether clinical features and cytokine levels in \nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) distinguish MPP from MPP complicated by PB \nand sought to identify risk factors for PB in children with MPP.\nMETHODS: A total of 128 children 3-14 years of age with MPP who underwent \nbronchoscopy at Jingmen Central Hospital, China, between 1 April 2023 and 31 \nMarch 2024 were enrolled. Patients were divided into a PB and a non-PB group \nbased on bronchoscopy findings. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, \nincluding BALF cytokine levels, were compared. A risk prediction nomogram for PB \nwas constructed and evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of 128 children with MPP, 40 (31%) had PB. Multivariate logistic \nregression analysis showed that clinically severe MPP (OR\u2009=\u20098.78; P\u2009=\u20090.002), \nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (OR\u2009=\u20092.78; P\u2009=\u20090.049) and \nelevated BALF interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR\u2009=\u20091.01; P\u2009<\u20090.001) were independent risk \nfactors for PB. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve \n(AUC) value for the combination of severe MPP, SIRS and IL-6 was 0.852 (95% \nconfidence interval, 0.77-0.93). A calibration curve showed good agreement \nbetween nomogram prediction and actual observations (P\u2009=\u20090.723). A decision \ncurve analysis indicated that the nomogram demonstrated good clinical \napplicability.\nCONCLUSION: Pronounced inflammatory responses and increased clinical severity of \nMPP are associated with PB. A nomogram that integrates clinical features and \nBALF IL-6 levels may be used for risk assessment and management of PB in MPP \nafter initial bronchoscopy."}

The innate immune response is critical for host defence against viral \ninfection, and the dysregulation of host innate immune responses likely \naggravates GETV infection. In this study, we use unbiased screening to identify \nGETV proteins that antagonise type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found that \nGETV Nsp2 could inhibit Sendai virus or poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter \nactivation, potently suppressing primary interferon production- a key component \nof the host's innate immunity antiviral response. Remarkably, Nsp2 showed \nefficient inhibition of the IRF3-responsive promoter, but not AP-1 or NF-\u03baB. \nFurther examination revealed that Nsp2 significantly suppressed luciferase \nactivity when RIG-I-CARD, MDA5, MAVS, or IRF3 activated the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. By \ncontrast, IRF3/5D led to less suppression of luciferase expression, partially \nrestoring luciferase activity, suggesting that Nsp2 interferes with the \nbiological function of IRF3 as a crucial strategy in its antagonism of IFN-\u03b2 \nproduction. Mechanistically, Nsp2 binds TBK1 to suppress IRF3 phosphorylation. \nMeanwhile, Nsp2 competitively inhibited the interaction of pIRF3 with KPNA3 and \nKPNA4, to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. Overall, we demonstrated that GETV \nsuppresses antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting the activation of IRF3, and \nNsp2 plays a crucial role in this process. These findings reveal a novel \nstrategy by which GETV evades the host innate immune response, providing new \ninsights into the pathogenesis of GETV."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "troponin", "text": "OBJECTIVES: Most patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency medical \nservices (EMS) setting are suspected of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(NSTE-ACS). Distinguishing true NSTE-ACS from non-cardiac chest pain based \nsolely on the ECG is challenging. The aim of this study is to develop and \nvalidate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for risk \nstratification of suspected NSTE-ACS patients and to compare its performance \nwith currently available prehospital diagnostic tools.\nMETHODS: For this study, an internal training cohort and an external validation \ncohort were used, both consisting of suspected NSTE-ACS patients. A CNN (ECG \ninterpretation by CNN (ECG-AI)) was trained and validated to detect NSTE-ACS. \nThe diagnostic value of ECG-AI in detecting NSTE-ACS was compared with on-site \nECG analyses by an EMS paramedic (ECG-EMS), point-of-care troponin assessment \nand a validated prehospital clinical risk score (prehospital History, ECG, Age, \nRisk factors and POC-troponin (preHEART)).\nRESULTS: A total of 5645 patients suspected of NSTE-ACS were included. In the \nexternal validation cohort (n=754), 27% were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS. ECG-AI had \na better diagnostic performance than ECG-EMS (area under the curve (AUROC) 0.70 \n(0.66 to 0.74) vs AUROC 0.65 (0.61 to 0.70), p=0.045) for diagnosing NSTE-ACS. \nThe overall diagnostic accuracy of preHEART was AUROC 0.78 (0.74 to 0.82) and \nsuperior compared with ECG-AI (p=0.001). Incorporating ECG-AI into preHEART led \nto a significant improvement in diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.83 (0.79 to \n0.86), p<0.001).\nDISCUSSION: Correctly identifying patients who are at low risk for having \nNSTE-ACS is crucial for optimal triage in the prehospital setting. Recent \nstudies have shown that these low-risk patients could potentially be left at \nhome or transferred to a general practitioner, leading to less emergency \ndepartment overcrowding and lower healthcare costs. Other studies demonstrated \nbetter overall diagnostic performance compared with our artificial intelligence \n(AI) model. However, these studies were aimed at a study population with a high \nprevalence of occlusive myocardial infarction, which could explain the differing \nlevels of diagnostic performance.\nCONCLUSION: Integrating AI in prehospital ECG interpretation improves the \nidentification of patients at low risk for having NSTE-ACS. Nonetheless, \nclinical risk scores currently yield the best diagnostic performance and their \naccuracy could be further enhanced through AI. Our results pave the way for new \nstudies focused on exploring the role of AI in prehospital risk-stratification \nefforts."}

It is \nhypothesized that arrhythmias refractory to ablation may be driven by PFs deep \nin the scarred myocardium. However, knowledge of human PF anatomy remains \nreliant on data generated in animal models, obscuring understanding of the \nsubstrate underpinning dysrhythmia and pacing strategies.\nOBJECTIVES: This study sought to establish and utilize a human biomarker to \ndelineate PF anatomy in humans.\nMETHODS: RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis of transcriptomes \nfrom human hearts (N = 10) revealed 99 genes up-regulated in PFs vs ventricular \nmyocardium and endocardium. Whole-mount megablock cross-sectional analysis was \nperformed with cardiac troponin, MYL4, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's Trichrome, \npro-ANP, and GJA5 colocalization.\nRESULTS: Comparative transcriptomics from human hearts (N = 10) identified \nmyosin light chain 4 (MYL4) as a promising human PF marker for distinguishing \nconductive from contractile myocardium. Using PF-rich bundle branch and \nsubendocardial regions, MYL4 specificity was validated using canonical PF \nmarkers in human (n = 3), dog (n = 3), goat (n = 3), and pig (n = 3) hearts. \nCross-sectional histology of the entire human ventricular myocardium uncovered a \ndeep-seated network of transmurally intercalated, MYL4-positive PFs. This \npreviously unrecognized distribution of the cardiac conduction system accounted \nfor over 60% of human myocardial PF content.\nCONCLUSIONS: Such significant intramural prevalence exposes limitations \nassociated with treatment approaches based on dogma that PF anatomy is \nrestricted to the subendocardium. MYL4 here enabled a comprehensive \nvisualization of human cardiac conduction system, offering an intricate \nbioanatomical map for heart rhythm management."}

Also, the histological sections in the \nextract-treated rats showed reductions in pathological features as compared with \nthe negative control group. Moreover, the chemical pathological changes were \nconsistent with histopathological observations suggesting marked \ncardio-protective potentials. Furthermore, the chromatographic analyses yielded \nbulked fractions {D3 (11 mg), E6 (25 mg), and E8 (21 mg)} and their GC/MS \nanalyses revealed dihydroartemisinin; retinoic acid, methyl ester; \u03b1-thujene; \n\u03b1-terpinolene; 9,12,15-octadecatrienal; \u03b1-terpineol etc. with already reported \nantioxidant activities. These ligands (dihydroartemisinin; retinoic acid, methyl \nester) obeyed Lipinski's criteria, had remarkable pharmacokinetic profiles, and \ntheir docking analyses revealed that they modulated antioxidant enzymes with \nbetter binding affinities than vitamin C.\nCONCLUSION: Given the demonstrated antidotal and cardioprotective properties of \nthe plant root, it presents a promising candidate for mitigating \ndoxorubicin-induced toxicities and could be effectively utilized as a supportive \ntherapy in such contexts."}

A\u03b242/40 was \nmeasured using the HISCL\u00ae platform, while all other biomarkers were measured \nusing the Simoa\u00ae platform. Participants were classified based on A\u03b2 PET imaging \nand neuropsychological testing into healthy controls (HC), AD continuum \n(preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment [AD-MCI], and mild dementia [AD-D]), \nand non-AD cognitive impairment (CI) groups. Receiver operating characteristic \nanalyses were performed to predict the A\u03b2 PET status, correlation with Centiloid \n(CL) values and cognitive scores, and biomarker comparisons across AD stages.\nRESULTS: Sixty-nine HC, 13 preclinical AD, 38 AD-MCI, 44 AD-D, and 79 non-AD CI \nparticipants were included. The area under the curves (AUCs) for predicting A\u03b2 \nPET status were 0.937 (A\u03b242/40), 0.926 (p-tau217), and 0.946 (p-tau217/A\u03b242); \nresults of pair-wise DeLong tests revealed no significant differences among \nthese three metrics (all p\u2009>\u20090.05).

To address this gap, we investigated the \nassociations of daytime nap timing and intraindividual variability of nap \nduration with incident Alzheimer's dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from 936 older adults (age range: 56-99; 77% female) \nin the Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine incident Alzheimer's dementia \nand from 320 deceased participants (age range at death: 71-105; 70% female) to \nexamine Alzheimer's pathology. The proportions of morning (9-11am) and early \nafternoon naps (1-3\u2009pm) and the intraindividual variability of nap duration were \nassessed using actigraphy. Participants completed neurological assessments at \nbaseline and annually for up to 17 years. In deceased participants, amyloid \u03b2 \nand neurofibrillary tangles were examined.\nRESULTS: Here we show that more morning naps are linked to a higher risk of \nAlzheimer's dementia, whereas more early afternoon naps are linked to reduced \namyloid \u03b2 levels. Higher intraindividual variability of nap duration is shown to \nbe associated with increased amyloid \u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that specific timing patterns and \nirregularities in daytime napping are linked to Alzheimer's disease risk and \npathology. Multi-dimensional assessments of nap behaviors may aid in risk \nstratification for neurocognitive impairment and offer a potential target for \ninterventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging."}

This review summarized the novel imaging targets and their \nclinical practice in human studies. The presynaptic dopamine transporters and \n18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) have been \ncharacterized as established biomarkers in PD. Furthermore, as the key \npathogenic protein in PD, \u03b1-syn aggregation forming Lewy bodies could drive the \nneuronal degeneration, making the \u03b1-syn-targeted PET imaging a critical focus in \nPD research. Other co-pathologies, including amyloid-\u03b2 and tau protein, were \nalso concluded for their clinical implications in PD. Additionally, the PET \nimaging targets for neuroinflammatory mechanisms, including mitochondrial \ndysfunction, microglial and astrocyte activation, hold promise for further \ninvestigation. Finally, the radiotracers detecting disruptions of blood-brain \nbarrier and glymphatic system would also represent as therapeutic opportunities. \nIn conclusion, the vigorous development of novel imaging biomarkers in PD will \nrefine the diagnostic frameworks, promoting for the future disease-modifying \ntherapies."}

Assessment of the biomechanical response is crucial to determine the \npathophysiological effects in the cardiovascular system derived from exposure to \nHAH."}

A novel application of skin biopsy is \nintroduced as a tissue-level surrogate for aortic wall integrity. Histological \nand transmission electron microscopy analyses were used to identify gradable \nultrastructural features of collagen and elastin organization. The AAVS \nframework defines three biological risk domains, substrate vulnerability, \nclinical fragility, and mechanisms of failure, each linked to a proposed scoring \nsystem under development. Clinical case illustrations demonstrate conceptual \nutility.\nRESULTS: The three domains of biological risk are (1) substrate vulnerability, \nassessed through the AAVS Score of histological; and ultrastructural analysis of \nskin biopsy as a surrogate for aortic tissue integrity; (2) clinical fragility, \ncaptured by the Vascular Fragility Score, which quantifies phenotypic indicators \nof vascular fragility from clinical history, physical findings, and imaging; and \n(3) mechanisms of failure, modeled by substrate vulnerability progression, a \nlongitudinal, dynamic modeling system that tracks substrate vulnerability \nprogression over time toward aortic failure and includes vascular health \nmodifiers that alter mismatch progression over time.\nCONCLUSIONS: AAVS introduces a structured clinical reasoning framework and skin \nbiopsy-based scoring approach for risk stratification in aortopathy and \narteriopathy. It reframes failure as a progressive biological process shaped by \nsubstrate integrity, not just anatomy or procedural success. Although the \nscoring systems remain under development, the cognitive framework offers \nimmediate utility for case interpretation, biologically matched surgical \nplanning, and future longitudinal modeling. Ongoing work aims to validate the \nscoring systems and refine biological risk assessment across diverse clinical \ncohorts."}

This study aimed to investigate the \nimmediate histological effects of MRF under varying settings, its short-term \nimpact on collagen and elastin synthesis, and the roles of fibroblasts and \nadipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Porcine abdominal skin was treated with an MRF device \ncontaining 49 insulated microneedles using varying energy parameters (8-12\u2009W; \n100-300\u2009ms). Immediate histological responses to treatment were evaluated \nthrough hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

Additionally, expression and distribution of ECM \nremodeling-related proteins (MMPs, TGF-\u03b2, EGF, Ki67) and ADSCs were analyzed by \nmultiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and western blot analysis.\nRESULTS: H&E staining revealed thermal coagulation zones in the dermis \nimmediately after MRF treatment, with zone size increasing with higher power and \nlonger pulse durations (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Furthermore, expression levels of TGF-\u03b2, EGF, and Ki67 \nsignificantly increased by Day 28 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). mIHC analysis of the fibroblast \nmarker FSP-1 coexpression, along with Western blot analysis of Collagen I, \nCollagen III, MMP-1, MMP-3, TGF-\u03b2, and EGF, revealed similar trends. Notably, \nsignificant expression of ADSC markers was detected at Day 7 posttreatment \n(p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: MRF predominantly promotes the synthesis of Collagen I and Collagen \nIII, increasing the Collagen I/III ratio, and regulates the expression of MMP-1, \nMMP-3, MMP-9, TGF-\u03b2, and EGF. These factors collectively drive fibroblast \nactivation, migration, and ECM remodeling. These changes are indicative of the \npotential for MRF to support skin regeneration and rejuvenation. Preliminary \nfindings suggest that ADSCs may contribute to these regenerative processes."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "fibrinogen", "text": "BACKGROUND: Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a rare and heterogeneous form of \ndystrophinopathy caused by expression of altered dystrophin proteins, as a \nconsequence of in-frame genetic mutations. The majority of the BMD biomarker \nstudies employ targeted approaches and focus on translating findings from \nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a more severe disease form with clinical \nsimilarities but caused by out-of-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene. \nImportantly, DMD therapies assume that disease progression can be slowed by \npromoting the expression of truncated dystrophin comparable to what occurs in \nBMD patients. In this study, we explore similarities and differences in protein \ntrajectories over time between BMD and DMD serum, and explore proteins related \nto motor function performance.\nMETHODS: Serum samples collected from 34 BMD patients, in a prospective \nlongitudinal 3-year study, and 19 DMD patients, were analyzed by using Data \nIndependent Acquisition Tandem Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS). Subsequent \nnormalization, linear mixed effects model was employed to identify proteins \nassociated with physical tests and dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. \nAnalysis was also performed to explore the discrepancy between DMD and BMD \nbiomarker abundance trajectories over time.\nRESULTS: Linear mixed effects models identified 20 proteins with altered \nlongitudinal signatures between DMD and BMD, including creatine kinase M-type \n(CKM) pyruvate kinase (PKM), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), lactate dehydrogenase \nB (LDHB) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M). Furthermore, several proteins related \nto innate immune response were associated with motor function in BMD patients. \nIn particular, A2M displayed an altered time-dependent decline in relation to \ndystrophin expression in the tibialis anterior muscle.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed differences in the serum proteome between BMD \nand DMD, which comprises proteins involved in the immune response, extracellular \nmatrix organization and hemostasis but not muscle leakage proteins significantly \nassociated with disease progression in DMD. If further evaluated and validated, \nthese biomarker candidates may offer means to monitor disease progression in BMD \npatients. A2M is of particular interest due to its association with dystrophin \nexpression in BMD muscle and higher abundance in DMD patients in comparison to \nBMD. If validated, A2M could be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in \ntherapeutic clinical trials aiming to restore dystrophin expression."}

Single gene differential analysis to \ndetermine the correlation between FGL1 and DNAJC12 expression levels in prostate \ncancer. The expression of FGL1 was silenced by siRNA in PC3 prostate cancer \ncells. Lentiviruses infected DU145 to overexpress FGL1.

The OS of \nPCa patients with high expression of FGL1 was significantly shorter. After \nsilencing FGL1, PC3 cell proliferation was inhibited by 0.58-fold, while \napoptosis increased by 16%, and the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 increased, \nwhile the expression of DNAJC12 and BCL-2 decreased.

It is purported that ASV may mitigate the inflammatory response, \ncardiac congestion, or fibrosis, but evidence supporting this assertion is \nsparse.\nMETHODS: This ancillary analysis of the multicentre, randomised, open-label \nTEAM-ASV I trial assessed patients with analysable blood samples at baseline and \n12-week follow-up. Patients were randomised to early ASV treatment in addition \nto standard care for AMI and standard care alone (control). Changes in the \nlevels of circulating biomarkers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive \nprotein [hs-CRP], fibrinogen, interleukin [IL]-6, and interleukin-33 receptor \n[IL-33R]), fluid overload (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] \nand antigen carbohydrate [CA]-125), and fibrosis (procollagen III type \naminoterminal propeptide [PIIINP] and matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-9) were \ncompared between the ASV and control groups.\nRESULTS: Forty SDB patients were analysed.

ROC curve \nanalysis was employed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of individual \nrisk factors for DVT diagnosis, followed by development of a multivariate \ncombined ROC curve model to assess its diagnostic value for DVT.\nRESULTS: Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative \nhematocrit (P\u2009=\u20090.015, OR\u2009=\u20091.082), preoperative triglyceride levels (P\u2009=\u20090.030, \nOR\u2009=\u20091.275), preoperative platelet count (P\u2009=\u20090.008, OR\u2009=\u20091.005), preoperative \nD-dimer level (P\u2009<\u20090.001, OR\u2009=\u20093.407), diabetes mellitus (P\u2009=\u20090.004, \nOR\u2009=\u20092.735), smoking history (P\u2009=\u20090.003, OR\u2009=\u20092.733), and hypertension \n(P\u2009=\u20090.002, OR\u2009=\u20092.795) showed significant positive associations with lower \nextremity deep vein thrombosis following THA. These factors were identified as \nindependent risk factors for post-THA DVT development.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative hematocrit, triglycerides (TG), platelet count, D-dimer \nlevels, smoking status, along with pre-existing hypertension and diabetes \nmellitus were all identified as significant risk factors for developing deep \nvein thrombosis following total hip arthroplasty. Surgeons should conduct \ncomprehensive preoperative assessments of these risk factors and implement \nindividualized prevention and treatment protocols to minimize the occurrence of \nlower extremity deep vein thrombosis."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "fibrinogen", "text": "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation, a defining feature of numerous neurological \ndisorders, arises predominantly from activating immune cells such as microglia, \nwhich play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous \nsystem. Microglial activation and polarization exhibit a dual nature, mediating \nboth neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects. Fibrinogen, as a potent \npro-inflammatory mediator, interacts with microglia and is implicated in the \nprogression of various neurological conditions. This study investigates the \neffects of fibrinogen and the exogenous STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone on \nprimary microglial function.\nMETHODS: Primary microglial cells were isolated from neonatal C57BL/6 mice and \nsubsequently treated with fibrinogen and the STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone. \nInflammatory marker expression was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain \nreaction, while protein levels of JAK2 and STAT3 were determined using \nimmunofluorescence and Western blot analysis.\nRESULTS: Fibrinogen exposure upregulated STAT3 and JAK2 phosphorylation in \nprimary microglial cells. Cryptotanshinone treatment effectively attenuated \nSTAT3 phosphorylation while concurrently downregulating JAK2 activation. \nFurthermore, fibrinogen significantly enhanced the release of pro-inflammatory \ncytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, while the transcription levels of TGF-\u03b2 \nremained unchanged.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that fibrinogen stimulates the production \nof pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary microglial cells by activating the \nJAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings provide mechanistic insights into \nfibrinogen-induced neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic targets \nfor neurological diseases."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "trypsin", "text": "BACKGROUND: Protein kinases play important roles in fundamental biological \nprocesses. Aberrant activities may result in many diseases, thus the detection \nof multiplex kinase activities is important in clinical diagnosis. Recent \nprogress has focused on the mass spectrometric biosensing technique to enable \nhighly sensitive detection of multiplex targets. However, the application of the \ndeveloped methods in multiplex enzyme analysis is greatly challenged due to the \nsubstrate immobilization on solid interfaces, which affect the contact between \nsubstrates and enzymes to reduce enzyme reaction efficiency.\nRESULTS: This work developed a homogeneous mass-encoded method for biosensing of \nmultiplex proteins, which was performed using designed peptides containing the \ncoding sequences and substrate regions. With the assistance of titanium dioxide \ncoated magnetic beads (TiO2-MBs) to capture the phosphopeptide products, \nfollowed by trypsin to cleave the products for releasing the coding sequences, \nthe kinase assays were achieved by submitting the supernatant for ultrahigh \nperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) \nanalysis. Using protein kinase A (PKA) and human epidermal growth factor \nreceptor 2 (HER2) as model targets, the peak area ratios of the coding sequences \nto the internal standards showed linear relations of 1.0-100\u00a0ng\u00a0mL-1 and 0.2-20 \nU\u00a0mL-1, with the detection limits of 0.46\u00a0ng\u00a0mL-1 and 0.033 U\u00a0mL-1 for HER2 and \nPKA, respectively. The proposed strategy also demonstrated great practicability \nin inhibition analysis and kinase activity assays in cell lysates.\nSIGNIFICANCE: A homogeneous mass-encoded method for multiplex detection of \nkinase activities could simplify the assay procedure and reveal the enzyme \nactivities with free substrates. The strategy enabled multiplex kinase activity \nassays with convenience, high sensitivity, and high specificity, demonstrating \npromising applications in clinical fields."}

Urothelial basal cells were \nisolated from rabbit bladder mucosa and cultured in vitro. The basal cells were \nthen transplanted in vivo in a manner of cell sheet for reconstruction.\nRESULTS: Via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it has been confirmed that \nthe cluster of KRT5high TP63-expressing cells possesses a ''stemness'' signature \nwhich can give rise to lineage cell types sequentially. With a strong support \nfrom the underneath pre-set capsule vascular bed, the transplanted cell sheet \ncould develop into a physio-morphology resembled to the native mucosa in vivo. \nImportantly, we validated that the bioengineered urothelium implemented perfect \nbarrier function after implanted to bladder.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, bioengineering urothelium with KRT5high TP63-expressing \nbasal cells on a capsule vascular bed offers a promising strategy for bladder \ntissue engineering and provides a model for drug screening and bladder disease \nresearch."}

The objective \nis to investigate the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of YTHDF1 in \nAD.\nMETHODS: The expression of YTHDF1 was investigated by bioinformatics analysis \nand skin lesions of AD patients. The functional role and upstream and downstream \nregulatory mechanisms of YTHDF1 were examined through a series of in vitro and \nin vivo experiments. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of YTHDF1 in \nthe AD mouse model was evaluated for its therapeutic potential.\nRESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the YTHDF1 mRNA level in the skin \nlesions of AD was significantly higher than that in healthy people. YTHDF1 \nexpression was significantly elevated in AD skin lesions, the DNCB-induced AD \nmouse model, and primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells stimulated with \ninterleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, compared to controls. Both in vitro and in vivo \nexperiments revealed that upregulation of YTHDF1 in AD exacerbated cell \nproliferation and inhibited keratinization by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, \nwhich was modulated via the IL-4/IL-13/STAT3 axis. Moreover, topical application \nof AAV-YTHDF1 significantly improved AD-like lesions in the mouse model.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identifies YTHDF1 as a contributor to AD pathogenesis by \ninfluencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. It also suggests \nthat YTHDF1 could be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment."}

Accurate \nhistopathological analysis of skull base tumors will strongly impact their \nfurther management. Yet, currently there is no noninvasive validated method to \nconfirm their diagnosis. In a recent study of MRI tractography, the authors used \nfiber orientation distribution (FOD) and noted that this diffusion model formed \na pattern that could correspond to the histopathological type of skull base \ntumors. The aim of this study was to propose a new imaging method for skull base \ntumors that can detect the diagnosis according to the FOD pattern.\nMETHODS: From an 81-case series of skull base tumors, MRI diffusion images were \ninvestigated by 3 independent observers. Diffusion patterns were classified as \ncentrifugal, wrapped, and chaotic, corresponding to meningiomas, schwannomas, \nand epidermoid cysts, respectively.\nRESULTS: The overall identification rate was 80.7%, with an excellent \nconcordance between the 3 observers (Fleiss's \u03ba coefficient = 0.765, p < \n0.0001).

RCS was prepared through electron beam irradiation and \ncross-linking followed by freeze-drying. Its properties were evaluated, \nincluding Fourier transform infrared analysis, swelling behavior, microscopic \nobservation, porosity measurement, compression modulus and structural stability. \nIn a rat gingival recession model with 96 rats divided into four groups, the \nroot coverage index and gingival health indices were measured, and histological \nanalyses were conducted. The cross-linked network structure of RCS provided \nexcellent mechanical properties and stability. In the rat model, RCS effectively \npromoted gingival regeneration, with the RCS group achieving a root coverage \nindex of 87.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0%, which was 54.13\u00a0%, 42.83\u00a0% and 8.41\u00a0% higher than that of \nthe sham operation group, non-crosslinked group and chemical crosslinked group \nrespectively. Histological analysis showed that RCS promoted anti-inflammatory \nmacrophage polarization, enhanced collagen deposition and gingival lamina \npropria fiber density and increased angiogenesis. Additionally, RCS exhibited \ngood biosafety, as blood indices and organ coefficients remained normal. In \nconclusion, RCS effectively promotes gingival regeneration and is a promising \nkeratinized gingiva substitute for gingival recession, offering a new option for \noral tissue repair."}

Because the protein also is a negative regulator of insulin \nsecretion in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, inactivating mutations in the SCHAD gene (HADH) \ncause congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) and severe hypoglycemia. Here \nwe sought to identify novel interaction partners of SCHAD that might be \nparticularly relevant for the endocrine pancreas.\nRESULTS: Employing the SCHAD protein as bait, we performed yeast 2-hybrid \nscreening of a cDNA library made from human islets of Langerhans. Surprisingly, \nthe screening revealed the intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) as a \nputative interaction partner of SCHAD with very high confidence. Previous \nreports have linked K8 to glucose homeostasis, and we confirmed the SCHAD \ninteraction by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells. SCHAD and K8 expression \nwere then characterized in the human \u03b2-cell model EndoC-\u03b2H1. By using proximity \nligation assay, we demonstrated that stimulating the cells with a high level of \nglucose triggered a transient increase in the interaction. However, when \nstudying knockout mice, we found that the loss of either K8 or SCHAD did not \nchange the expression level of the other interaction partner. Still, when K8 \nknockout mice were challenged with a ketogenic diet, upregulation of SCHAD \nexpression was blunted compared to the upregulation observed in wildtype \nlittermates.\nCONCLUSIONS: We propose that the SCHAD protein interacts with K8 in a way that \nmight be relevant for proper functioning of the pancreatic \u03b2-cell. Whether the \nSCHAD-K8 interaction influences the phenotype of CHI remains to be demonstrated."}

Understanding the developmental patterns of soft palatal \nmusculature is crucial for improving treatments. Although mice are commonly used \nto investigate soft palate development, the uvula deficiency in mice limits \ntheir applicability. This study aims to compare the developmental \ncharacteristics of soft palate muscles in miniature pigs and mice at various \nstages to better understand the patterns in large mammals.\nMETHODS: Specimens of soft palate were collected from human embryos, miniature \npigs and mice at different stages. Furthermore, comprehensive gross \nobservations, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, and immunohistochemical analyses \nfor myosin heavy chain and Hypermethylated cancer 1 (Hic1) were conducted on \nmultiple dissected sections.\nRESULTS: Mature soft palatal musculature exhibited anatomical and histological \nsimilarities across the three species. Notably, miniature pigs exhibited the \nuvula structure and uvula muscle development comparable to humans. Embryonic day \n40 (E40, equivalent to human embryonic week 11, E11w) represented the early \ndevelopmental stage of the uvula muscle, characterized by scattered muscle cells \nnot yet coalescing into multinucleated fibres. By E45 (aligned with human E12w), \nthe muscle bundles reached maturity, exhibiting two oriented fibre bundles \nflanking the midline. Levator veli palatini muscle and palatopharyngeus of \nminiature pigs exhibited a distinct course pattern due to the presence of the \nuvula muscle. Hic1+ perimysial cells were observed at the extending edge of the \ndeveloping palatopharyngeus of miniature pigs, indicating a potential guiding \nrole in the migration of myogenic cells.\nCONCLUSION: Characterized by the uvula muscle, the spatiotemporal dynamic \nprocess of soft palatal musculature of miniature pigs was revealed. Miniature \npigs exhibit a similar structure of the uvula muscle to that of humans and \ntherefore serve as a promising model for researching soft palatal musculature \ndevelopment of large mammals in the future."}

Moreover, CJME reduced interleukin-6 \n(IL-6) levels in both CT26 CM-stimulated myotubes and the serum of CT26-induced \ncancer cachexia mice. The mechanism underlying these effects appears to involve \nthe suppression of STAT3 activation by CJME. These findings suggest that CJME \nhas potential as a therapeutic candidate in the management of cancer cachexia."}

This bidirectional \nsystem integrates endocrine, neural, and immune signals, impacting host \nmetabolism and cognition. The gut microbiota, a critical component of the GBA, \nsignificantly impacts gut hormones, neurotransmission, neural development, and \nother components of gut-brain-axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis facilitates \ncommunication via metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and \nneurotransmitters such as dopamine, \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) and serotonin. \nThe microbiota influences gut peptide production, including ghrelin, glucagon \nlike pepetide-1 (GLP-1), serotonin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), thereby \nmodulating nutrient absorption and immune responses. Gut hormones such as \nghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), serotonin (5-HT), \nneurotensin, peptide YY (PYY) and melatonin play key roles in the GBA. These \nhormones play several roles including modulation of appetite and satiety, \nmetabolism of nutrients such as lipid and glucose, insulin and glucagon \nsecretion, and influence on gut inflammation, mood, learning and cognition. The \ninteraction between gut microbiota and these hormones underscores their role in \nmaintaining gut-brain homeostasis.

Key eligibility criteria included age \n\u226518 years, \u22651 Tirzepatide claim, no baseline T2D diagnosis codes or \nantihyperglycemic medication use (except metformin), and continuous medical and \npharmacy enrollment for \u226512 months pre-index. Demographic characteristics were \nassessed at the index date, while clinical characteristics and treatment-related \ndata were identified during the 12-month pre-index period. Tirzepatide \npersistence and utilization (6 months post index) were assessed for individuals \nwith \u22656 months of follow-up after initiation of Tirzepatide treatment (index \ndate). Data were analyzed separately for each database.\nFINDINGS: Overall, 15,534 eligible adults were identified in the MarketScan \ndatabase and 6800 in the Optum CDM database; mean age was 46.2 years and 55.9 \nyears, respectively, and in both databases, >70% were female. A total of 70.6% \n(MarketScan) and 81.0% (Optum CDM) of individuals had at least one \nobesity-related complication, with the most prevalent being hypertension, \ndyslipidemia, and pre-diabetes. There were 8709 individuals in the MarketScan \ndatabase and 3384 in the Optum CDM database with \u22656 months of follow-up. In both \ndatabases, approximately two-thirds of people were started on 2.5 mg and, by the \nsixth prescription fill, the most common doses of Tirzepatide were 5 mg and 7.5 \nmg. Tirzepatide persistence ranged from 60.6% to 75.7% across both databases, \nwith an allowed gap between prescriptions of 45 days or 60 days. Of individuals \nwho discontinued tirzepatide, 10.2-19.5% restarted Tirzepatide during the \n6-month follow-up.\nIMPLICATIONS: In both databases, most people initiating Tirzepatide without T2D \ndiagnoses had \u22651 obesity-related complication, indicating that Tirzepatide is \nbeing used in people with multimorbidity.

Recent studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists can improve cognitive function through brain activation in \npatients with T2DM, compared to other oral glucose-lowering drugs. Mazdutide, a \ndual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon \nreceptor (GCGR), has been shown to simultaneously reduce body weight, blood \nglucose levels, and other comorbidities associated with obesity in patients with \nT2DM. While its insulinotropic and glucose-lowering effects through the GLP-1 \npathway are well-established, mazdutide may also enhance energy expenditure via \nactivation of the GCGR pathway. However, its potential impact on cognitive \nfunction remains to be elucidated.\nMETHODS: This study aimed to investigate the effects of mazdutide on cognitive \nbehaviour and cerebral pathology in male db/db mice, a model of T2DM, in \ncomparison to dulaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist.

Furthermore, transcriptomic, proteomic, \nand metabolomics analyses were employed to explore the underlying molecular \nmechanisms of mazdutide's effects.\nFINDINGS: Compared to dulaglutide, mazdutide significantly improved cognitive \nperformance in db/db mice, as evidenced by comprehensive behavioural tests. \nPathological assessments revealed improvements in neuronal structure and brain \ntissue integrity in the mazdutide-treated group. Multi-omics analyses further \nidentified distinct molecular pathways involved in neuroprotection, energy \nmetabolism, and synaptic plasticity, suggesting that dual GLP-1/GCGR activation \ncontributes to enhanced cognitive resilience.\nINTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that mazdutide, via its dual GLP-1/GCGR \nactivation effects, exerts multifactorial improvements in cognitive function in \nthe context of obesity and T2DM. These results suggest that mazdutide is a \npromising therapeutic option for mitigating cognitive deficits associated with \nmetabolic disorders.\nFUNDING: Medical Science and Technology Research and Development Plan Major \nProject Jointly Constructed by the Henan Province and Ministerial Departments in \nChina (No. SBGJ202301010)."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "calcitonin", "text": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence supports the immunoregulatory role of \ncalcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine pathophysiology. The \nincreasing use of anti-CGRP therapies in patients with migraine and other \ncomorbidities raises the question whether the potential use of anti-CGRP \nmonoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) therapies in combination with other \nimmunological therapies is effective and safe.\nMETHODS: This multicenter study included patients with migraine receiving \nCGRP-mAbs combined with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments. \nClinical and demographic data, treatment history, laboratory markers and \ntreatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were analyzed. Effectiveness outcomes \nincluded the change in monthly migraine days (MMD) and monthly headache days \n(MHD) at 3, 6, 9 and 12\u00a0months, alongside the\u2009>\u200950% response rate. Moreover, \nautoimmune disease progression was also evaluated. We explored differences \nbetween patients with and without autoimmune disease activation.\nRESULTS: Among 89 patients, there were 80 (90%) females with a mean age of \n50\u00a0years (SD: 11), who had a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities \n(anxiety 44%, depression 49%) and medication overuse (68%). Patients receiving \nimmunological treatments experienced significant reductions in MMD and MHD, with \nMMD decreasing from 16 (SD: 7) at baseline to 9 (SD: 8) at 6\u00a0months, and MHD \ndropping from 23 (SD: 8) to 17 (SD: 11). A 50% response in MMD was achieved by \n46% at 6\u00a0months. TEAEs were reported in 28%, most commonly constipation (16%) \nand dizziness (9%).\nCONCLUSIONS: CGRP-mAbs therapies combined with immunological treatments appear \neffective and safe in patients with autoimmune diseases. Larger prospective \nstudies are necessary to confirm these findings and optimize management \nstrategies."}

The study used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry \nto detect the essential metabolites of mobocertinib in rat liver microsomes. \nMoreover, several antihypertensive drugs were used as inhibitors and the IC50 \nvalues were determined for calcium channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor \nblockers, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor blockers against mobocertinib. The inhibitory \nmechanism of mobocertinib was further investigated for nicardipine, irbesartan, \ntelmisartan, carvedilol, prazosin hydrochloride, and spironolactone. Twenty-five \nSprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: benidipine, \nnicardipine, telmisartan, irbesartan and blank control groups. The drugs were \nadministered over a period of 7 days. Mobocertinib was administered once by \ngavage to 5 groups, and then blood samples were collected for further analysis. \nUltra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to \nanalyze the concentration of mobocertinib and its metabolites in rat plasma. \nMost antihypertensive drugs were found to inhibit the metabolism of mobocertinib \nin vitro. Several antihypertensive drugs were also found to increase the plasma \nconcentration and decrease the metabolic rate of mobocertinib when administered \nmultiple times. More importantly, we found that benidipine, nicardipine, \ntelmisartan, and irbesartan inhibited the metabolism of mobocertinib in vitro \nand in vivo. In summary, our data reveal that antihypertensive drugs interact \nwith mobocertinib and additional attention is needed when coadministering the 2 \ndrugs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study investigates the potential drug-drug \ninteractions between commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs and mobocertinib \nin clinical practice to provide the scientific basis for the appropriate \ntherapeutic application of drugs. In this study, the most common \nantihypertensive drugs were found to inhibit the metabolism of mobocertinib in \nvitro. We found that benidipine, nicardipine, telmisartan, and irbesartan \ninhibited the metabolism of mobocertinib in vitro and in vivo."}

All Danish adults with a hospital-diagnosis of CKD and access to \nthe official Danish electronic letter system were individually randomized in a \n1:1 ratio to usual care (no letter) or to receive an electronic letter-based \nnudge on GDMT in CKD; general practices of individuals with CKD were \nindependently randomized (1:1) to receive no letter or an electronic \ninformational letter on GDMT. Intervention letters were delivered on August 19, \n2024.

However, limited \nevidence is available on disentangling the effects of AHTN use on KC from \nhypertension, which is a risk factor for KC. We aimed to identify pooled \nestimates for the associations between AHTN use and KC risk, independent of \nhypertension.\nMETHODS: We searched for observational studies that investigated the \nassociations between AHTN use and KC through January 2025. To identify the \nindependent effects of AHTN from hypertension, we conducted stratified analyses \nwith and without accounting for hypertension: any methods (matching, adjustment, \nor stratification/restriction) versus none. We conducted random-effects \nmeta-analyses with robust variance estimation to calculate pooled relative risk \n(RR).\nRESULTS: In this meta-analysis consisting of 39 eligible studies, AHTN use was \nassociated with an increased risk of KC based on estimates that accounted for \nhypertension (RR 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.52 for \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.31 for \nangiotensin receptor blocker; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16 for beta-blocker, RR \n1.40, 95% CI 1.12-1.75 for calcium channel blocker (CCB); RR 1.36, 95% CI \n1.20-1.55 for diuretic; and RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.75 for non-classified AHTN). \nFindings from duration\u2012response relationships supported the main findings.\nCONCLUSIONS: AHTN use was associated with an increased risk of KC compared to no \nuse, even after accounting for hypertension, with the highest risk observed for \nCCB.

This study aimed to investigate lisinopril-based \nradioconjugates for nuclear imaging of ACE.\nMETHODS: Lisinopril conjugates were prepared using solid-phase peptide synthesis \nand labeled with gallium-67. The resulting radioconjugates were assessed for \ntheir in vitro stability in saline and in mouse and human blood plasma. \nACE-mediated uptake was evaluated in HEK cells transfected with human ACE, and \nthe findings were interpreted using molecular dynamic studies. Tissue \ndistribution profiles of the radioconjugates were evaluated in mice bearing \nHEK-ACE xenografts by means of nuclear imaging and classic biodistribution \nstudies. The feasibility to detect physiologic ACE was further assessed by ex \nvivo autoradiography of the lungs and the kidneys collected from mice injected \nwith [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02.\nRESULTS: DOTA-LIS-01, DOTA-LIS-02 and NODAGA-LIS-02 were prepared with >\u200998% \nchemical purity. Radiolabeling of the conjugates with gallium-67 was achieved at \n80 MBq/nmol with >\u200999% radiochemical purity. [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 and \n[67Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02 exhibited radiolytic stability for up to 3\u00a0h in saline \nand remained intact in mouse and human blood plasma for 1\u00a0h. The uptake of \n[67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 and [67Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02 in HEK-ACE cells after 3\u00a0h \nincubation reached\u2009~\u200957% and ~\u200950%, respectively, while only\u2009~\u200921% cell uptake \nwas reached with [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-01. This discrepancy was ascribed to the \nfavorable binding mode of the LIS-02 radioconjugates with a longer linker \nbetween DOTA and lisinopril, as demonstrated by molecular dynamic studies. \nNuclear images demonstrated uptake of all radioconjugates in HEK-ACE xenografts \nbut not in HEK-ACE2 xenografts. At 1\u00a0h after injection of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02, \nthe accumulation in HEK-ACE xenografts of mice reached 14\u2009\u00b1\u20093% IA/g, whereas \nonly 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3% IA/g uptake was observed for [67Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02. The ex vivo \nautoradiograms of kidneys and lungs of mice injected with [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 \nonly, or co-injected with excess lisinopril confirmed ACE-specific binding of \nthis radioconjugate.\nCONCLUSION: [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 emerged as the most promising candidate to \nvisualize ACE in mice. Further (pre)clinical studies will be necessary to \nvalidate the radioconjugate's potential for assessing ACE expression dynamics \nunder pathophysiological conditions."}

Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or \nplacebo 21\u00a0days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered \u22656\u00a0months after the \npreceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and \n4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human \nangiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and \nresponse durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to \nOmicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.\nRESULTS: Immune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses \nof NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional \ndoses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; \ndurable responses were recorded 8\u00a0months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd \ndose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and \nBQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose \nexceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of \nNVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.\nCONCLUSIONS: NVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to \nancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults \nand adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into \npotential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. \nAdditional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. \nThese results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued \nupdates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat \nSARS-CoV-2 infection."}

This study aimed to investigate the independent and synergistic \neffects of overweight status and metabolic abnormalities on sepsis mortality.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from 16,288 sepsis \npatients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database (version \n3.1). We performed multivariable Cox regression to assess associations between \noverweight status (Body mass index \u226525 kg/m2), metabolic abnormalities, and \nmortality outcomes (28-day, 90-day, 1-year). Mendelian randomization (MR) was \nused to assess causal relationships between these exposures and 28-day \nmortality.

MR analysis confirmed no causal \nrelationship of overweight status, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia on \nsepsis-related 28-day mortality. The observed protective effects of metabolic \nabnormalities were explained by medications used to treat these conditions, \nincluding biguanides, sulfonylureas, \u03b2-blockers, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme \ninhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, and statins.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study challenges the \"obesity paradox\" in sepsis, \ndemonstrating that the observed protective effects of metabolic abnormalities \nare predominantly driven by pharmacological interventions. These findings \nunderscore the importance of optimizing pharmacological strategies to enhance \nsepsis management."}

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive \nsphingolipid metabolite, is a potent vasoconstrictor in afferent arterioles. We \nhypothesized that IR enhanced afferent arteriolar sensitivity to S1P-induced \nvasoconstriction, thus contributing to renal microvascular dysfunction and \nkidney injury in AKI. The impact of IR on afferent arteriolar reactivity to S1P \nwas assessed using the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron \npreparation in male rats subjected to 60 minutes of bilateral renal arterial \nischemia followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Baseline diameter of afferent \narterioles declined significantly following IR. S1P evoked \nconcentration-dependent vasoconstriction in both sham and IR rats. However, the \nS1P concentration-response curve left-shifted after IR and its EC50 reduced by \n8-fold (P <\u00a00.05), suggesting enhanced afferent arteriolar reactivity to S1P. \nS1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) blockade with JTE-013 increased arteriolar diameter by \n38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% following IR contrasted to a 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% increase in sham rats (P <\u00a00.05), \nindicating that endogenous S1P exerts a significant impact on afferent \narteriolar tone after IR.

In higher eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is wrapped \naround histones to form nucleosomes, which are irregularly folded into condensed \nchromatin domains ranging from euchromatin to heterochromatin. These domains \nhave distinct functions and physical differences that impact chromatin \naccessibility. Recently, replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling \nwas developed to specifically mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and \nheterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this technique, \nnucleosome behavior was revealed across four chromatin classes, from euchromatin \nto heterochromatin. Interestingly, nucleosome motion is progressively \nconstrained along this spectrum. Nucleosomes in euchromatin domains fluctuate \nmore like a liquid, whereas those in heterochromatin are highly constrained, \nresembling a gel-like state. How these physical properties relate to \nDNA/chromatin accessibility and genome function remains an important question. \nIn this review, we discuss not only the physical differences between euchromatin \nand heterochromatin but also how nucleosome behavior influences the physical \naccess of proteins to their DNA targets within chromatin, which underlies the \ninitiation of essential DNA transaction processes, including transcription."}

Investigating the regulatory network of OsSh1 in controlling \nseed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.) offers biological insights and \npotential for agricultural applications. Here, we identified a transcription \nfactor of CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, and TOC1(CCT) family, OsCCT22, that \nphysically interacts with OsSh1 in rice. oscct22 mutants exhibited a phenotype \nsimilar to ossh1 mutants, characterized by incomplete development of abscission \nlayers and reduced seed shattering ability. Transcriptomic analysis revealed \nthat OsSh1 and OsCCT22 jointly regulate the expression of genes involved in \nlignin biosynthesis. Notably, transcription of the cinnamyl alcohol \ndehydrogenase (CAD) gene OsCAD2, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT), and \nO-methyltransferase 16 (ROMT-16) was directly inhibited by OsSh1 binding to \ntheir key binding motif. This repression was enhanced by the interaction between \nOsCCT22 and OsSh1. Additionally, our study suggests that OsSh1 regulates the \ntranscription of OsCAD2 by modulating histone methylation modifications near the \nfirst intron. Loss-of-function mutations in OsCAD2 led to the formation of more \nextensive abscission layers and a significant reduction in lignin deposition, \nresulting in natural seed shattering.

Exclusion criteria included estimated \nglomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73m2, ongoing anticoagulant treatment, \nthrombophilia, prior thrombosis, malignancy, or pregnancy. Markers of \nendothelial cell function, platelet function, thrombin generation and \nfibrinolysis were compared to those of healthy individuals (n ranging from 10 to \n174 depending on assay).\nRESULTS: Patients with nephrotic syndrome (n = 47) had significantly increased \nthrombin generation markers compared to healthy individuals, as indicated by \nelevated prothrombin fragment 1+2 (509 pmol/L, 95% CI 426-592 vs. 183 pmol/L, \n95% CI 171-196; p <0.001) and thrombin-antithrombin complex (3.5 \u00b5g/L, 95% CI \n3.2-3.8 vs. 2.5 \u00b5g/L, 95% CI 2.3-2.7; p <0.001).

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "thrombin", "text": "Many patients suffer from venous thromboembolism (VTE) and its consequences. \nDespite substantial advancements with the introduction of direct oral \nanticoagulants (DOACs), patients and clinicians still encounter challenges in \nthe acute and long-term management of VTE, such as recurrent events, \nanticoagulant-related bleeding complications, and post-thrombotic symptoms. \nAdditionally, certain patient populations, including those with advanced kidney \nfailure and liver cirrhosis and elderly individuals, were excluded from phase 3 \nclinical DOAC trials. Therefore, the call for innovative anticoagulants in the \nacute and long-term management of VTE resonates, not only to mitigate long-term \nrecurrences and post-thrombotic symptoms but also to maintain the delicate \nharmony of hemostasis. Novel targets within the coagulation and fibrinolytic \nsystem, as well as mechanisms governing adherence to the vessel wall, are \ncurrently being explored to address these unmet needs. First, factor XI \ninhibitors have shown promise in preclinical and phase 2 clinical studies to \ntackle thrombosis while preserving hemostasis, although phase 3 trials are \nrequired for confirmation. Next, there is interest to boost the endogenous \nfibrinolytic system, with \u03b12-antiplasmin, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis \ninhibitor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 emerging as potential \nattractive targets. Finally, strategies to inhibit the interaction between \nleucocytes and the vessel wall are also under exploration. This review provides \nan overview of the latest clinical advancements in the pharmacological \nmanagement of VTE."}

APAC has entered human studies as a dual \ninhibitor of von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet recruitment on collagen and \nthrombin generation. We aimed to assess safety and escalating intravenous (i.v.) \ndoses of APAC on hemostasis using a large animal model.\nMETHODS: We studied escalating APAC boluses (0.15-1.5\u00a0mg/kg; n\u2009=\u200911) and their \nreversal in anesthetized pigs for pharmacodynamics using functional coagulation \ntesting. In some experiments, aspirin (500\u00a0mg) was co-administered with APAC, \nand protamine sulfate for reversal. Blood was repeatedly sampled for blood cell \ncounts (CBC), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin and \nthrombin time (PT, TT), thrombin generation (TG), activated clotting time (ACT), \nrotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and collagen-induced platelet aggregation \n(CIPA).\nRESULTS: APAC was well-tolerated, and CBC remained stable. APAC modestly \ninhibited CIPA at high doses, while APTT, TT and ACT, unlike PT, prolonged \ndose-dependently. The anticoagulant ED50 doses of APAC and UFH showed similar \nrange (0.54 vs. 0.43\u00a0mg/kg), but UFH lasted longer and was less reversible by \nprotamine. At 0.75\u00a0mg/kg of APAC, TG was abolished, InTEM coagulation and clot \nformation times were prolonged\u2009\u2265\u20092.8-fold, maximum clot firmness was reduced to \n8-45%, and amplitude to 35-80%. APAC effects were transient (T1/2 \nAPAC\u2009=\u200930\u00a0min), and reversible by protamine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Escalating i.v. doses of APAC were safe and provided modest \nplatelet inhibition.Our results indicate that the dose-dependent anticoagulation \neffects of APAC can be monitored using conventional laboratory assays."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "thrombin", "text": "Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a critical condition that requires rapid and \neffective intervention. Although thrombin is a widely used hemostatic agent, its \nefficacy is limited in the harsh environment of the digestive tract, especially \nin patients with chronic liver disease or coagulation disorders. Current \ntreatment techniques often fall short, particularly when faced with severe blood \nloss and coagulation challenges. Here, a novel solution: waxberry-inspired smart \nnanogels that offer a cost-effective, highly efficient, and mechanically stable \napproach for local hemostasis is presented. Drawing inspiration from the \nmicrofibrous structures of waxberry, a waxberry-like nano-silica with a radially \nfibrous structure is synthesized for effective thrombin loading and release upon \nemergency. This nano-silica, coated with GelMA, forms a stable nanogel network \nactivated by blue laser during endoscopy. Within just 5 s, the nanogel \neffectively triggers coagulation, even in patients with coagulation disorders. \nThe formed blood clots are stable enough to withstand the challenging conditions \nof the digestive tract, preventing secondary bleeding. Upon injection, thrombin \nrapidly converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a secondary network that \nreinforces clot stability. This dual-network system demonstrates strong adhesive \nproperties and effective hemostasis in the blood of cirrhotic patients, as well \nas in gastrointestinal bleeding scenarios involving the esophagus, stomach, and \nduodenum of mini-pigs."}

Several studies have reported the use of contrast-enhanced \nultrasound (CEUS) to diagnose active bleeding in parenchymal organs. Fluid \ngelatin is a new hemostatic material that can be injected into the bleeding site \nby using a puncture needle under the precise guidance of CEUS, which enables the \nimplementation of local minimally invasive and appropriate hemostatic treatment. \nHere, we report the case of a patient in whom CEUS was used to accurately locate \nthe bleeding site before surgery and guide local injection of fluid gelatin with \na puncture needle to successfully achieve nonsurgical treatment of hemostasis. \nCASE REPORT A 62-year-old man with post-hepatitis B cirrhosis underwent a \nsuccessful liver transplant surgery. After surgery, abdominal puncture and \ndrainage were performed because of a large amount of peritoneal effusion due to \nnephrotic syndrome. The drainage fluid was bright red bloody liquid. CEUS \nrevealed many contrast agent microbubbles extravasating from the inferior \nepigastric artery into peritoneal effusion along the abdominal puncture tract. \nSurgical suturing and applying a compression bandage failed to achieve \nsatisfactory results. After receiving the patient's consent, thrombin and \nhemostatic glue were injected locally under the guidance of CEUS. Finally, \nhemostasis was successfully achieved. CONCLUSIONS CEUS-guided injection of fluid \ngelatin is a safe and effective treatment method and could serve as an effective \nmeasure for nonsurgical treatment and postoperative supplementary treatment of \nactive bleeding from the inferior epigastric artery."}

Despite the availability of anticoagulants and \nthrombolytic agents, their clinical use is often limited by adverse effects. \nGinkgo biloba extract (GbE), a traditional herbal medicine, has shown promise in \nalleviating thrombosis, but its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently \nunderstood. This study aimed to explore the antithrombotic effects and molecular \nmechanisms of GbE through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments.\nMETHODS: Online databases were utilized for identifying the GbE's active \ncomponents and target genes, accompanied by thrombosis-related targets. \nFunctional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia \nof Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were performed. A drug-active \ncomponent-target gene-signaling pathway network and a protein-protein \ninteraction (PPI) network were constructed to determine core target genes and \npathways. In vivo, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) model was established by \nligating the inferior vena cava in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin and \neosin staining was adopted for evaluating the vascular endothelial structure. \nThe levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), \nnitric oxide (NO), and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured, accompanied by the \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and \nprothrombin time (PT). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the \nPI3K/AKT pathway-related protein expression.\nRESULTS: GbE comprised 27 active components with 4727 target genes and 2462 \nthrombosis-related targets, with 974 shared targets, including AKT1, ALB, GAPDH, \nTNF, and IL6, enriched in PI3K-AKT and AGE-RAGE pathways. Molecular docking \nindicated strong binding of GbE's main components to core targets. In vivo, GbE \nsignificantly relieved vascular lesions of DVT rats; reduced thrombotic wet \nweight; increased NO, cGMP, and PGI2 levels; decreased FIB; and prolonged APTT, \nPT, and TT (P < 0.05). Additionally, Western blot highlighted the suppressed \np-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios in DVT rats.\nCONCLUSIONS: GbE alleviates thrombosis by increasing antithrombotic factors and \nreducing coagulation, potentially via downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling. \nFuture studies should focus on long-term clinical trials and broader animal \nmodels to further validate GbE's therapeutic potential and explore other \nmolecular mechanisms."}

However, the complex interactions and \nsignaling pathways between MM cells and BM stromal cells remain inadequately \ndefined. In this study, we employed an in vitro coculture model to investigate \nthese interactions. We found that coculturing MM cells with BM-derived HS5 \nstromal cells stimulated the secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA) and interleukin-6 \n(IL-6), and significantly increased the expression of CD44 and F-actin stress \nfibers polymerization in MM cells. Among the three hyaluronan synthase (HAS) \nisoforms, HAS3 mRNA expression was most significantly elevated in MM cells \nfollowing coculture with HS5. This coculture also resulted in upregulation of \nHAS3 and IL-6 mRNA in MM cells. Notably, MM cells in direct contact with HS5 \ncells exhibited higher proliferative capacity compared to those not in contact \nwith the stromal cells. Additionally, coculturing MM cells with HS5 led to the \nformation of membrane protrusions in MM cells, with CD44 enrichment observed at \nthese polarized regions. Further analysis revealed that Rac1 co-localizes with \nCD44 on MM cells within the coculture system, suggesting that Rac1 signaling \nplays a critical role in CD44-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements.

However, its potential benefits in improving \ncardiovascular (CV) risk factors have yet to be determined. We assessed the \neffect of orforglipron in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and/or \noverweight or obesity on blood pressure, lipid, and inflammatory biomarkers \nassociated with risk for major adverse cardiovascular events.\nMETHODS: Using data from participants with available samples from Phase 2 trials \nof orforglipron in participants with T2D (N\u2009=\u2009361) or with overweight or obesity \nwithout diabetes mellitus (N\u2009=\u2009234), we performed an exploratory analysis of \nchanges in CV risk markers. For the T2D study, participants mean age 59\u00a0years, \n40% were assigned female at birth with a mean HbA1c of 8.1% and mean BMI of \n35.3\u00a0kg/m2; they received once daily orforglipron doses (3, 12, 24, 36, or \n45\u00a0mg) or once weekly subcutaneous dulaglutide 1.5\u00a0mg, or placebo. In the \nobesity study, participants had a mean age 54\u00a0years, 60% were assigned female at \nbirth, and mean BMI was 37.9\u00a0kg/m2; they received once daily orforglipron (12, \n24, 36, or 45\u00a0mg) or placebo. The change from baseline at 26\u00a0weeks (T2D study) \nor 36\u00a0weeks (obesity study) in blood pressure, lipids (cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), Apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3), N-terminal \npro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), and inflammatory biomarkers \n(high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6)) were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: Significant placebo-adjusted decreases from baseline in blood pressure, \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, ApoB, ApoC3, and hsCRP \nwere observed following orforglipron treatment in participants with T2D and/or \noverweight or obesity. In both studies, improvements in blood pressure, lipid \nparameters, and most of the evaluated biomarkers were of similar magnitude after \ntreatment with 12\u00a0mg orforglipron as with 24, 36, and 45\u00a0mg.\nCONCLUSION: Orforglipron treatment was associated with beneficial changes in CV \nrisk markers in participants with T2D and in participants with \noverweight/obesity without T2D.

This study \nexplored the involvement of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 \n(PCSK9) in the development of vulnerable plaques triggered by \nhyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), with a focus on lipid metabolism, and inflammation. \nApolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were fed a methionine-rich diet to \ninduce HHcy. PCSK9 inhibition via SBC-115076 significantly improved plaque \nstability. HHcy upregulated PCSK9 levels, and hinder cholesterol efflux by \ndownregulating the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. In \ncontrast, no significant effects were noted on low-density lipoprotein receptor \n(LDLR), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), or scavenger receptor class B type \nI (SR-BI). Inhibition of PCSK9 led to the restoration of ABCA1 and ABCG1, \nthereby facilitating an increase in cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, PCSK9 \ninhibition reduced HHcy-induced increase of proinflammatory cytokines, including \ninterleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha \n(TNF-\u03b1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In vitro, mouse \nperitoneal macrophages (MPMs) exposed to HHcy presented reduced ABCA1 and ABCG1, \nwhereas LDLR, CD36, and SR-BI remained unaffected. PCSK9 knockout reversed these \nchanges. Additionally, HHcy upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, \nalong with the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) /nuclear factor kappa B \n(NF-\u03baB) pathway. PCSK9 inhibition reduced the production of these cytokines and \nmitigated the activation of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway, confirming its role in \nmacrophage inflammation. These findings reveal that PCSK9 exacerbates \nHHcy-related AS by impairing cholesterol efflux and promoting inflammation. \nPCSK9 inhibitors may offer a dual therapeutic approach for stabilizing plaques \nand reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with HHcy."}

It is commonly used to \nmanage liver fibrosis (LF). However, the precise antifibrotic mechanism of \nlevistilide A (LA), the major bioactive constituent of Danggui, remains largely \nunexplored.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the inhibitory effects of LA on nitric oxide \n(NO) production in M1 macrophages and to elucidate its anti-LF property.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using lipopolysaccharide/interferon-\u03b3-activated RAW264.7 \nmacrophages for in vitro studies to investigate LA's repressive effects on \nnuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/NO axis in M1 \nmacrophages. Additionally, using CCl4-induced LF mice for in vivo studies to \nexplore LA's therapeutic mechanism on LF via restraining the NF-\u03baB/iNOS/NO axis.\nRESULTS: LA markedly attenuated p65 activation in M1 macrophages, leading to a \ndose-dependent suppression of iNOS expression, and a concomitant reduction in NO \nproduction. In CCl4-induced fibrotic mice, LA administration resulted in a \nsignificant reduction in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate \naminotransferase and NO, mitigating hepatic tissue injury and collagen \ndeposition. Furthermore, LA downregulated the hepatic expression of iNOS, tumour \nnecrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, \nwhile upregulating interleukin-10 and matrix metalloproteinase-12. Additionally, \nLA significantly reduced the hepatic protein expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle \nactin, CD86, p65, p-p65 and iNOS, further supporting its antifibrotic efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS: LA exerts antifibrotic effects by suppressing NO overproduction \nthrough inhibition of the NF-\u03baB/iNOS signalling pathway in M1 macrophages, \nthereby demonstrating therapeutic potential in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis."}

We hypothesized that late gestation heat stress leads to \nalterations in gene expression in the cotyledonary tissue related to acute \ninflammation and impact the mechanisms of placental nutrient uptake, affecting \nthe trajectory of fetal growth. Multiparous pregnant Holstein cows had lactation \nterminated (i.e. dried-off) at 232\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 days of gestation and were randomly \nassigned to one of two treatments: cooling (CL; access to the shade of a barn \nplus forced ventilation via fans and water soakers over the feed lane to provide \nactive evaporative cooling) or heat-stress (HT; access to the shade of a barn \nand natural ventilation, no active cooling) for the entire duration of their dry \nperiod. Maternal plasma (n\u00a0=\u00a028/trt) cortisol concentrations were measured at \ndays -14, -7 prior to and at parturition. At delivery, placental cotyledonary \ntissue samples were collected and analyzed for gene expression (n\u00a0=\u00a04-5/trt). \nDuring the final weeks of gestation, treatment impacted plasma cortisol \nconcentrations as calving approached (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), wherein HT dams exhibited lower \nplasma cortisol concentrations than CL dams at -14 days (9.65 vs. \n13.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0ng/ml; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and at parturition (16.97 vs. 22.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0ng/ml; \np\u00a0<\u00a00.001), combined with significant changes in placental gene pathways \nassociated with acute inflammation and cortisol synthesis and secretion. \nSpecifically, pathways related to interleukin-6 (IL6) and NLR family pyrin \ndomain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), which regulate inflammation, were \nupregulated by HT, suggesting placental inflammation. Additionally, pathways \ninvolved in nutrient transfer and amino acid metabolism were impaired, as HT \ndownregulated key genes responsible for these functions, especially serine \nbiosynthesis. These findings indicate that HT during late gestation leads to \ndysregulation of cortisol secretion pattern in maternal plasma, resulting in \nreduced cortisol levels in the HT animals. Additionally, it also caused \nplacental inflammation impacting feto-maternal transfers, highlighting the \nimportance of late gestation period on fetal development and managing maternal \nenvironmental stressors in dairy production."}

Chronic low-grade inflammation is a complex immune \nresponse contributing to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. This \nresponse is signaled in part by interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic, \npro-inflammatory cytokine. Phenotypic variance in circulating IL-6 level may be \nexplained in part by DNA methylation which is increasingly being associated with \ncardiovascular effects.\nMETHODS: In this study we evaluated methylated DNA (CpG sites) associated with \nblood IL-6 levels across \u223c4,400 ancestrally diverse individuals (81\u00a0% \nself-reported White; 9\u00a0% Black or African American, 8\u00a0% Hispanic or Latino/a, \nand 2\u00a0% Chinese American).\nRESULTS: We identified 178 CpG sites associated with IL-6 (p<0.05/\u223c395,000). \nAmong the sites, cg04437762 is located within the transcription unit of IL6R, a \ncurrent therapeutic target for inflammatory disease, and cg26692003 and \ncg00464927 were significant for IL6 and IL6ST trans-CpG-gene transcripts. \nFunctional gene expression downstream of methylation identified cellular \nresponse to IL-6 and B-cell regulation and activation pathways. Four genes were \nlinked with both a genetic component of cardiovascular disease and an IL-6 \nassociated CpG site. Three CpG sites identified through Mendelian randomization \nanalyses supported inference of a causal effect on IL-6 levels, including the \nLYN gene that regulates immune cell signaling and has been previously associated \nwith atherosclerosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, we identified several novel IL-6-CpG sites and downstream \npathways affected by methylation. Follow-up functional studies including the \nregulation of IL-6 would complement current knowledge of CVD pathophysiology and \npotential therapeutic targets."}

This report describes a 50-year-old man with \nadvanced HCC associated with multiple venous tumor thromboses treated with \nhepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with bevacizumab and \nsintilimab conversion therapy. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old man was admitted to the \nhospital due to elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in July 2022. Abdominal \ncomputed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a large HCC with multiple venous \ntumor thromboses. Pulmonary CTA detected arterial embolism and multiple solid \nnodules. He received HAIC combined with bevacizumab and sintilimab every 3 \nweeks, and achieved partial response after 3 cycles. However, in March 2023, \nlevels of AFP and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) were \nre-elevated, showing some pulmonary nodules were enlarged, which was confirmed \nas pulmonary metastases by positron emission tomography/computed tomography \n(PET/CT). Subsequently, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with bevacizumab \nand sintilimab was performed, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was \nused to treat pulmonary metastases. Skull metastasis appeared in March 2024, \nrequiring further local radiotherapy. Despite this, the patient has survived for \nover 26 months, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 8 months. CONCLUSIONS \nHAIC combined with bevacizumab and sintilimab can alleviate primary HCC and \ntumor thromboses, and further local radiotherapy can control the progression of \ndistant metastases, prolonging the survival time of patients with advanced HCC."}

However, \ninsufficient transparency in methodology reporting compromises the validity \nassessment of these findings and hinders their translational applications. In \nthis study, we investigated the adherence to the STARD criteria in studies \ninvestigating the diagnostic accuracy of miRNA for liver cancer. In addition, \nthe quality of reporting was examined to identify factors influencing the \nquality of reporting.\nMETHOD: A comprehensive search strategy was performed on the PubMed, EMBASE, \nCochrane Library, and Web of Science, as of March 30, 2023. Clinical trials \ninvestigating the diagnostic value of miRNA for HCC diagnosis were included in \nthe analysis. The eligible studies were checked against adherence to the STARD \ncriteria. Factors determining quality of studies were evaluated through subgroup \nanalyses. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (varsion25.0).\nRESULTS: Sixty-two eligible studies, all published between 2010 and 2022, were \neventually included in the final analysis. The results revealed a moderate \noverall adherence to STARD 2015, with an average of 12.1 (52.6%) of the 23 items \nreported. Subgroup analysis revealed that adherence to the STARD 2015 varied \namong countries (USA 58.7%;Egypt 46.5%)(p<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The quality of studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of miRNAs \nin HCC was average and did not increase after the publication of STARD 2015. Our \nfindings rise awareness regarding the need to improve STARD standards, implying \nthat more journals need to include STARD standards for relevant manuscripts. In \naddition, editorial and peer approval procedures should adopt measures that will \naim to improve reporting quality."}

Pure PHC, which lacks any features of adenocarcinoma or \nneuroendocrine differentiation, is a subset of this population and is extremely \nrare. Data on its management and genomic findings are limited, and further \ncharacterization may provide helpful information in caring for these patients.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old female was found to have a large, \nwell-circumscribed mass in the body of the pancreas with elevated serum \nalpha-fetoprotein. Imaging demonstrated an 8.5 cm pancreatic lesion with no \nother disease. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a bile-producing \ncarcinoma with morphological and immunohistochemical features consistent with \nhepatocellular carcinoma. She underwent a subtotal pancreatectomy and \nsplenectomy, and pathologic evaluation confirmed a well-differentiated pure PHC \nconfined to the pancreas. Whole genome and transcriptome analysis showed \nmicrosatellite stability, an elevated tumour mutation burden, copy number \nalterations in Chr19p13.3, and no mutations typically seen in pancreatic ductal \nadenocarcinoma (PDAC). These findings support the diagnosis of a pure hepatoid \ncarcinoma with clinical, histopathological, and genomic characteristics \nresembling hepatocellular carcinoma. She remains disease free at 9 months \nwithout adjuvant therapy.\nCONCLUSION: This case demonstrates further characterization of a rare pancreatic \nlesion and illustrates the importance of integrated histopathological and \ngenomic analyses in characterizing rare malignancies. Additionally, our findings \nsuggest that pure PHC may be a distinct entity rather than a variant of PDAC."}

In this \nstudy, we aimed to develop a novel model based on changes in perioperative \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels to \npredict early recurrence following hepatectomy for HCC.\nMETHODS: This study is a dual-center retrospective cohort study. Based on strict \ninclusion and exclusion criteria, 317 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients \nfrom Center 1 and 58 patients from Center 2 were enrolled. Patients from Center \n1 were randomly allocated in a 7:3 ratio into a training set (n=221) and an \ninternal validation set (n=96), while Center 2 served as an independent external \nvalidation set. In the training set, independent risk factors associated with \nearly recurrence after hepatectomy for HCC were identified through univariate \nand multivariate analyses, and a predictive model was constructed. The \npredictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating \ncharacteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Calibration curves and decision curve analysis \n(DCA) were employed to assess model calibration and clinical utility, \nrespectively. Additionally, model interpretability was visualized through the \nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. Based on the combined model's \npredictions, this study further stratified patients' two-year progression-free \nsurvival (PFS) and five-year overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier curves.\nRESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that alpha-fetoprotein \n(AFP), total bilirubin (TB), postoperative ALT (ALTp), HBV infection history, \ntumor size, and change in AST and ALT (CAA) were independent risk factors for \nearly recurrence (P<0.05). The predictive model incorporating these factors \nachieved an AUC of 0.804, demonstrating robust predictive capability. The model \nexhibited strong consistency between predicted outcomes and actual observations \nin the training, internal validation, and external validation sets.\nCONCLUSION: This retrospective cohort study successfully established a \npredictive model for early recurrence after hepatectomy in HCC patients, \nhighlighting its potential clinical utility."}

The fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity were extracted from the \nhepatobiliary phase of the tumor using box-counting algorithms. Additionally, \nconventional imaging features were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate \nlogistic regression analyses were conducted in the training set to identify \nindependent predictors for VETC, and a nomogram was created to visualize the \nfinal predictive model. The performance of these models was tested in the \ninternal and external test sets.

The FD-lacunarity model achieved an area under receiver \noperating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: \n0.70-0.87) in the internal test set and 0.79 (95%CI:0.70-0.86) in the external \ntest set. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified serum \nalpha-fetoprotein, tumor size, intratumor artery, FD, and lacunarity as \nindependent predictors for VETC, which were used for constructing the hybrid \nmodel. A clinical model was established using AFP, tumor size, and intratumor \nartery alone. The diagnostic performance of the hybrid model was significantly \nsurpassed that of the clinical-radiological model when fractal parameters were \nincorporated, with AUCs increasing from 0.72 to 0.80 in the internal test set \nand from 0.65 to 0.84 in the external test set (all p < 0.05).

We aimed to determine if a mouse model with \nCAA (Tg-SwDI) also exhibits elevated levels of AT 1 Rs and whether \nRAAS-targeting drugs (telmisartan and lisinopril) mitigate these effects.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Tg-SwDI mice were treated with sub-depressor doses of \neither telmisartan or lisinopril from 3-8 months of age, with blood pressure \nbeing monitored 2 and 4 months after the start of treatment.

However, the increased risk of hyperkalaemia is a major concern. \nThis study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose (12.5\u2009mg/day) \nspironolactone in reducing albuminuria and improving renal function in Iranian \nadults with DKD.\nMETHODS: This was a pre-post-treatment study of 60 patients with type 2 \ndiabetes, age\u2009>\u200918\u2009years, albuminuria \u2265\u200930\u2009mg, estimated glomerular filtration \nrate (eGFR)\u2009\u2265\u200930\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2, and serum potassium level \u2264\u20095\u2009mEq/L, who were \nreferred to the diabetes clinic of Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The patients \nwere prescribed spironolactone (12.5\u2009mg) once daily. Changes in urinary albumin \nexcretion (U.Alb), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), blood pressure, \nserum creatinine (Cr) levels, and serum potassium levels from the baseline over \nthe 12-week intervention period were measured. Statistical significance was set \nat p\u2009<\u20090.05.\nRESULTS: After 12\u2009weeks of taking 12.5\u2009mg/day spironolactone, there was a \nstatistically significant but modest increase in eGFR (p\u2009=\u20090.042), and a \nstatistically significant decrease was observed in both the U.Alb and uACR \n(p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was a significant reduction in the mean Cr level (p\u2009=\u20090.003). \nSystolic blood pressure did not decrease significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.079), but \ndiastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.007).

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "renin", "text": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a chronic kidney condition that \narises from prolonged hyperglycaemia that can progress to kidney failure, severe \nmorbidity, and mortality if left untreated. It is the major cause of chronic \nkidney disease among people who have diabetes, accounting for a significant \npercentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease who require kidney \nreplacement therapy.\nMAIN BODY: In DKD, numerous dysbalanced metabolic, haemodynamic, inflammatory \nsignalling pathways, and molecular mediators interconnect, creating a feedback \nloop that promotes general kidney damage. Hyperglycaemia is the primary trigger \nfor DKD and leads gradually to oxidative stress, inflammation, extracellular \nmatrix deposition and fibrosis, glomerular hypertension, and intrarenal hypoxia. \nKey interconnected metabolic pathways are the hyperglycaemia-mediated polyol, \nhexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation end-products pathway \nhyperactivity. Concurrently, hyperglycaemia-induced \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulation, alters the kidney \nintraglomerular haemodynamic leading to inflammation through Toll-like \nreceptors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and \nnuclear factor-kappa B, transforming growth factor-beta-mediated excessive \nextracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. The resulting death signals \ntrigger apoptosis and autophagy through Hippo, Notch, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway \nactivation and microRNA dysregulation. These signals synergistically remodel the \nkidneys culminating in intrarenal hypoxia, podocyte dysfunction, \nhyperfiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and loss of kidney function. \nThe resulting renal failure further upregulates these death pathways and \nmediators, giving rise to a vicious cycle that further worsens DKD.\nCONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of the primary molecular mediators \nand signalling pathways leading to DKD; their interconnectivity at the onset and \nduring DKD progression, the central role of transforming growth factor-beta via \ndifferent pathways, the Hippo pathway kidney-specific response to \nhyperglycaemia, and how all mediators and transduction signals result in a \nvicious circle that exacerbates renal failure. The review gives therapeutic \nsights to these pathways as druggable targets for DKD management. Understanding \nthese molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of DKD can bridge basic \nresearch and clinical application, facilitating the development of innovative \nmanagement strategies."}

This study aimed to investigate the \nsafety and efficacy of alcohol-mediated bilateral adrenal artery embolization \n(Bi-AAE) in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). A total of 72 \npatients were randomly assigned in a (1:1) ratio to receive either Bi-AAE or \nspironolactone (20-60\u2009mg/day).

Bi-AAE also resulted in significantly greater reductions in 24\u2009h and \nhome SBP at 1, 3, and 6 months (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, Bi-AAE was more \neffective in correcting biochemical abnormalities, including hyperaldosteronism \nand renin suppression (all P\u2009<\u20090.05).

However, the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem (RAAS) blockade on the risk of AKI in HNC patients undergoing CCRT is \ncontroversial. This study aimed to investigate the association between RAAS \nblockade, AKI and survival in HNC patients undergoing CCRT.\nMETHOD: This retrospective cohort study included 989 HNC patients treated \nbetween January 2016 and July 2022, with follow-up extending to July 2022. Among \nthem, 65 (6.6%) patients were using RAAS blockade for hypertension control, \nwhile 924 were non-users. Clinical data and demographics were retrieved. Cox \nregression models were employed to analyze primary outcomes, including AKI and \npatient survival.\nRESULTS: There were 65 (6.6%) patients being RAAS blockade users in the study. \nThe mean age of RAAS blockade users was older than that of non-users (61 vs. \n55\u00a0years old, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Overall, 219 (22.1%) patients developed AKI, including \n25 RAAS blockade users. RAAS blockade users had a higher risk of AKI compared to \nnon-users (38% vs. 21%, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and also had a worse mortality rate (35% vs. \n22%, p\u2009=\u20090.015). Factors such as male gender, age, RAAS blockade usage, and \nbaseline serum creatinine levels independently predicted the onset of AKI and \npatient survival.\nCONCLUSION: RAAS blockade users developed AKI, which significantly predicted \npatient survival. Diligent post-CCRT renal function monitoring and hydration in \nRAAS blockade users are crucial to mitigate AKI risk and potentially improve \nsurvival in this patient group."}

However, \nspecific functional advantages of WPH have not been documented. To create WPH \nthat offers both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, this research \ncombined computer-aided virtual enzymolysis with fragmentomics and molecular \ndocking methods. The best protease combination was identified through a \nmulti-index evaluation system, and in vitro experiments were conducted to \nconfirm the results. Initially, composite enzyme combinations were evaluated via \nvirtual enzymolysis. Based on the composition of polypeptides and amino acids in \nwhey protein single enzymolysis fragments (WPSF) and their potential activity \nfrequency, five individual proteases-chymotrypsin A, proteinase K, papain, \nficin, and stem bromelain-were selected for further analysis. Subsequently, the \nchymotrypsin A\u00a0+\u00a0papain (AP) and proteinase K\u00a0+\u00a0papain (KP) combinations were \nchosen based on the proportion, potential activity frequency, and activity \nscores of peptides in whey protein complex enzymolysis fragments (WPCF). The \nintegration of fragmentomics and molecular docking techniques was employed to \nrefine the composite enzyme combinations. Compared with the WPCF of the AP group \n(APWPCF), fragmentomics analysis indicated that WPCF of the KP group (KPWPCF) \nexhibited a significantly greater proportion of dipeptides (60.65\u00a0% compared to \n49.35\u00a0%) and hydrophobic amino acids (32\u00a0% versus 19.6\u00a0%). Furthermore, the \nincreased ratio of absolute net charge exceeding 0 (61.36\u00a0% versus 56.31\u00a0%) \nsuggests an enhanced capacity for free radical scavenging, as well as improved \npotential for digestion and absorption without associated toxicity. Molecular \ndocking techniques revealed that KPWPCF can demonstrate anti-inflammatory and \nantioxidant properties by interacting with important proteins (P65, IKK-\u03b2, iNOS, \nKeap1) in the NF-\u03baB and Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathways. Additionally, in vitro \nstudies showed that the whey protein hydrolysate from KP (K-PWPH) has a a higher \ndegree of hydrolysis (DH) (24.76\u00a0%), NO inhibition rate (14.85\u00a0%), and oxygen \nradical absorption capacity (9.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41\u00a0mmol Trolox/g), with a molecular weight \nless than 3\u00a0kDa. Thus, the combination of proteinase K and papain \n(KP)-especially the stepwise enzymolysis process that first uses proteinase K \nfollowed by papain-can be employed to create whey protein hydrolysates with both \nanti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

Many proteins share common \nsubstructures and recurring secondary structure elements that contribute to \nsimilar 3D folding patterns, even across different protein families. This study \nexamines two distinct groups of proteins, the RNase A-like fold and the \ntrypsin-like serine protease fold, classified by SCOPe. These proteins share \nonly some substructures that contribute to their folding cores. Despite minimal \nsequence identity, they exhibit partial structural similarities in their 3D \ntopologies. We used a sequence-based approach, including inter-residue average \ndistance statistics and contact frequency prediction, to explore these folding \ncharacteristics. Structural observations guided further analyses of conserved \nhydrophobic residue packing, highlighting key folding units within each fold.\nRESULTS: Our analysis predicted two compact regions within each protein group. \nInteractions between these regions form a partially shared topology. We \nidentified conserved hydrophobic residues critical to these interactions, \nsuggesting a common mechanism for establishing these structural features. \nDespite overall structural differences between the RNase A-like and trypsin-like \nfolds, our findings emphasize the presence of a shared partial folding core.\nCONCLUSIONS: The partially shared structural features in the RNase A-like and \ntrypsin-like serine protease folds reflect a convergent folding mechanism. This \nmechanism underscores the evolutionary adaptation of protein folding, where \ndistinct folds can still retain critical, conserved structural motifs. These \nfindings highlight how proteins with overall different topologies can evolve to \nshare key folding features, demonstrating the elegance and efficiency of protein \nevolution."}

When these digestive enzymes do not \nfunction properly, maldigestion, malabsorption, and malnutrition may result. \nPresented here is a case study of an individual newly diagnosed with chronic \npancreatitis, along with a genetic analysis of his son and an in-silico analysis \nof two of the variant proteins.\nMETHODS: This study was conducted using human subjects, namely, the proband \n(father) and his son. Medical genetic testing of the proband (father) identified \nthe presence of two variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor gene \n(CFTR): variant rs213950, resulting in a single amino acid change (p. \nVal470Met), and variant rs74767530, a nonsense variant (Arg1162Ter) with known \npathogenicity for cystic fibrosis. Medical testing also revealed an additional \nmissense variant, rs515726209 (Ala73Thr), in the CTRC gene. Cheek cell DNA was \ncollected from both the proband and his son to determine the inheritance pattern \nand identify any additional variants. A variant in the human leukocyte antigen \n(rs7454108), which results in the HLA-DQ8 haplotype, was examined in both the \nproband and his son due to its known association with autoimmune disease, a \ncondition also linked to chronic pancreatitis. In silico tools were subsequently \nused to examine the impact of the identified variants on protein function.\nRESULTS: Heterozygosity for all variants originally identified through medical \ngenetic testing was confirmed in the proband and was absent in the son. Both the \nproband and his son were found to have the DRB1*0301 (common) haplotype for the \nHLA locus. However, the proband was also found to carry a linked noncoding \nvariant, rs2647088, which was absent in the son. In silico analysis of variant \nrs213950 (Val470Met) in CFTR and rs515726209 (Ala73Thr) in CTRC revealed \ndistinct changes in predicted ligand binding for both proteins, which may affect \nprotein function and contribute to the development of CP.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case study of a proband and his son provides additional \nevidence for a polygenic inheritance pattern in CP.

Patients were divided into two groups: the observation group (n = 61) \nreceived a home-based exercise combined with nutritional care intervention, \nwhile the control group (n = 65) received standard oncological nursing care. \nNutritional status was assessed using biomarkers (albumin, prealbumin, \ntransferrin) and PG-SGA scores, while QoL was measured using the Generic Quality \nof Life Inventory-74 (GQOLI-74). Data was analyzed using independent t-tests and \nChi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups (P > 0.05). \nFollowing the intervention, the observation group exhibited significantly \ngreater improvements in nutritional biomarkers compared to the control group: \nalbumin (41.80 \u00b1 5.45 g/L vs. 32.25 \u00b1 5.37 g/L, t = 9.905, P < 0.001), \nprealbumin (288.59 \u00b1 25.95 mg/L vs. 219.20 \u00b1 23.05 mg/L, t = 15.89, P < 0.001), \nand transferrin (2.28 \u00b1 0.28 g/L vs. 1.77 \u00b1 0.23 g/L, t = 11.20, P < 0.001).

Methods CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of \nBLVRB in multiple breast cancer cell lines demonstrated its profound effect on \nintracellular redox state and cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft models. \nIntegrated proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic studies identified and \nvalidated BLVRB-mediated adaptive metabolic responses required for breast cancer \ncell cytoprotection. Results We have established BLVRB as a requisite component \nof the pro-survival redox defense mechanism in breast cancer cells. Targeted \ndeletion of BLVRB induces reductive stress, leading to alterations in \nendoplasmic reticulum proteostasis and lipid composition. These defects impact \nplasma membrane functionality and endosomal recycling of multiple oncogenic \nreceptors, such as HER2 and transferrin receptors. Conclusions These data \ncollectively identify BLVRB as a novel metabolic target in breast cancer, \ndistinct from other redox-regulating pathways. This study, along with our recent \nprogress in developing novel specific BLVRB inhibitors, offers a unique \ntranslational opportunity for targeted therapies in personalized breast cancer \nmedicine."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "transferrin", "text": "Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive iron overload disorder. It occurs due \nto a failure in the hepcidin response, leading to systemic iron overload. The \nhigh iron levels in the plasma stored in various organs cause injury and \npermanent damage. There are two types of hemochromatosis: primary and secondary. \nIn non- HFE hemochromatosis, mutations in the HJV, HAMP, TRF2, and SLC40A1 genes \nare implicated, with the associated condition classified as type I \nhemochromatosis. In contrast, juvenile hemochromatosis (type II hemochromatosis/ \nHFE II) is linked to mutations in the hemojuvelin gene or the antimicrobial \npeptide hepcidin. In this study, relevant literature in databases, including \nPubMed, MEDLINE records, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials \n(CENTRAL), Google Scholar, and Embase, was searched. Our study inclusion \ncriteria encompassed both experimental and observational studies or a \ncombination of both, with data derived from the human population. The exclusion \ncriteria included animal models, observational studies, and unpublished data. \nHepcidin is usually up-regulated in response to high serum iron, but it is \nunexpectedly low in patients with hemochromatosis because of mutations in HFE, \nhemojuvelin (JH), and transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2). TfR2, expressed by \nhepatocytes, is mutated in hemochromatosis type III. Future research directions \ninclude exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the TFR2 \ngene variant on iron homeostasis and liver damage and investigating potential \ntherapeutic targets for treating hemochromatosis-related liver disease. \nAdditionally, further epidemiological and modern genetic engineering studies are \nneeded to better understand the prevalence and impact of hemochromatosis on \nliver health in different populations."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "lactoferrin", "text": "The emergence and development of pathogenic bacterial resistance to antibiotics \npose significant challenges to human health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are \nconsidered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Lactoferricin \n(Lfcin), a cationic AMP located in the N-terminal region of lactoferrin, serves \nas the antimicrobial active center of the intact protein. The presence of two \ncysteines in Lfcin allows for the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, \nwhich may influence its molecular structure and antibacterial function. To \ninvestigate this hypothesis, we synthesized, purified, and identified bovine \nLfcin along with two derivatives: Lfcin with a disulfide bond (Lfcin DB) and a \nmutated form that cannot form the disulfide bond (Lfcin C36G). We analyzed the \ncircular dichroism spectra of these peptides under varying ionic and hydrophobic \nconditions, while their tertiary structures were predicted using AlphaFold3. \nResults indicated that increased ionic strength reduced the random coil ratios \nacross all peptides. The secondary structure of Lfcin showed similar percentages \nwith Lfcin C36G in the H2O and similar ratios with Lfcin DB under hydrophobic \nconditions. AlphaFold3-predicted models revealed two distinct structures: one \npredominantly adopting \u03b1-helix conformations and the other characterized by \n\u03b2-sheet topology.

Neuroendocrine deficiencies affecting \nthe hypothalamic-pituitary axes are well-known but the mechanisms underlying \nprolactin secretion in CP patients are unclear. This study analyzed the factors \nassociated with prolactin serum concentrations in CP patients.\nMETHODS: Patients with adamantinomatous CP, diagnosed as children, adolescents \nor young adults (<\u200926 years) were included in this study. In 98 cases, serum \nprolactin concentrations were measured before breakfast after fasting for at \nleast 10\u00a0h, using an electrochemiluminescence assay, with concentrations \nanalyzed for associations with diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic parameters.\nRESULTS: Serum prolactin concentrations were within normal, age- and \ngender-specific ranges in 39 cases (38%), with decreased concentrations in 22 \ncases (21%) and elevated concentrations in 37 cases (36%). Factors positively \nassociated with increased prolactin levels were age at CP diagnosis, degree of \nsurgical resection, and suprasellar tumor location. Decreased prolactin levels \ncorrelated with irradiation and pituitary deficiencies of thyroid-stimulating \nhormone and vasopressin. Patients with decreased prolactin concentrations \nexhibited lower event-free survival. Prolactin concentrations were not \nassociated with functional capacity, tumor volume, calcifications, or \nanthropometric parameters at diagnosis or at the time of study.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prolactin levels in CP patients are influenced by the impact of the \ntumor on the hypothalamic-pituitary axes, resulting in either increased or \ndecreased serum concentrations. Prolactin levels could serve as a clinical \nmarker for certain sequelae after CP diagnosis. Patients with abnormal prolactin \nlevels should be monitored for signs of hypothalamic syndrome.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT00258453; NCT01272622; NCT04158284."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "prolactin", "text": "OBJECTIVE: As modern endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) becomes increasingly \nrefined, patients with large prolactinomas may seek alternatives to lifelong \ndopamine agonist (DA) therapy. This may raise interest in reassessing potential \ntreatment paradigms and surgical outcomes, particularly in patients who have had \nlong-standing symptoms and sought a more definitive solution. The objective of \nthis study was to explore the viability of EES in experienced centers as a \nreliable alternative to managing macroprolactinomas.\nMETHODS: A multicentric cohort of patients with histologically proven \nmacroprolactinoma treated with EES over 12 years was retrospectively reviewed. \nEarly surgical results and the determinant factors of outcome were analyzed \nusing a multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves.\nRESULTS: A total of 76 patients with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 42.1 \u00b1 15.6 years and \ntumor diameter of 22.7 \u00b1 12.1 mm was included. Gross-total resection (GTR) was \nachieved in 56.6%, with Knosp grade (OR 0.167, CI 0.044-0.633, p = 0.008) and \nclival invasion (OR 0.119, CI 0.019-0.765, p = 0.025) being the only independent \npredictors. Short-term remission (52/76 patients [68.4%]) was less frequent in \npatients with cystic tumors (OR 0.004, CI 0.0001-0.0911, p = 0.04) and was \nhigher in those with intended (OR 36.375, CI 1.627-813.128, p = 0.023) or \nachieved (OR 32.341, CI 1.487-703.558, p = 0.027) GTR in multivariate analysis. \nThe second half of the learning curve showed early complication rates of 41% \nversus 16.2% in the first half (p = 0.01). During a mean 47.9 \u00b1 33 months of \nfollow-up, the permanent complication rate was 6.6% and 3/51 patients (5.9%) had \nrecurrence. Overall 4-year recurrence-free survival was significantly lower in \nDA-dependent patients (70% vs 100%, p < 0.001). Last follow-up prolactin levels \nwere positively correlated with postoperative day 1 levels (correlation \ncoefficient 0.403, p < 0.001), with final normoprolactinemia rates significantly \nhigher in the GTR group than in the non-GTR group (76.7 vs 45.2%, p = 0.005). \nDA-resistant/intolerant patients achieved significant prolactin levels reduction \n(576 to 17 \u00b5g/L, p < 0.001), with normal prolactin level in 51.1% of patients \nand long-term remission in 35.6%. The overall long-term DA-free remission rate \nwas 39.3%, with the highest preoperative prolactin level (OR 0.999, CI \n0.996-0.998, p = 0.042) being the only independent predictor of failure. \nSubgroup analysis showed remission rates of 80% versus 23.9% in patients with \nthe highest preoperative prolactin levels < 150 versus \u2265 150 \u00b5g/L, respectively \n(p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The authors found that modern EES in multidisciplinary centers was \na low-morbid option for patients with macroprolactinoma. Remission rates were \nconsistent with those of recent studies with variably sized prolactinomas, and \nrecurrence rates were low. Although not universally definitive for \nmacroprolactinomas, early EES can be offered for patients with the highest \npreoperative prolactin levels below 150 \u00b5g/L who are unwilling to receive \nlong-term medication. Radiological criteria alone should not be the sole factor \nin surgical decision-making."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "prolactin", "text": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of circadian misalignment, particularly social jetlag \n(SJL), contributes significantly to the epidemic of metabolic disorders. \nHowever, the precise impact of SJL on the liver has remained poorly elucidated.\nMETHODS: The rhythmicity of circulating prolactin (PRL) was evaluated in \nsubjects with SJL and mice under SJL. The causative mechanism of SJL on fatty \nliver was explored using jetlag model in wild-type and Prl-/- mice. Luciferase \nreporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation analysis were used to study the transcriptional mechanism of \nretinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1 on PRL. RNA-seq on human and \nmice liver as well as circadian analysis were used to study the mechanism of \nSJL-associated desynchronized PRL on hepatic lipid metabolism. The therapeutic \neffect of PRL intervention on SJL-induced mice at different time points was \ncompared.\nRESULTS: SJL increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic \nliver disease (MASLD), mediated by the disruption of the rhythmicity of serum \nPRL. In particular, SJL inhibits the rhythmic transcription of PRL in the \npituitary, leading to desynchronized PRL levels in circulation. Under jetlag \nconditions, the rhythmicity of the hepatic PRL signaling pathway was \nsignificantly dampened, which resulted in increased lipogenesis via inhibited \nhepatic mitogen-activated protein kinase/cyclin D1 expressions. Notably, PRL \ntreatment at PRL nadir in jetlagged mice decreased hepatic lipid content and \nliver injury markers to a greater extent compared with conventional PRL \nadministration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reprogrammed hepatic PRL signaling pathway with concomitant \ndysregulated lipid metabolism homeostasis was the causative mechanism of fatty \nliver under SJL, which was mediated through derailed serum PRL rhythm. \nRestoration of PRL rhythm could effectively alleviate SJL-induced fatty liver, \nproviding new insight into treating MASLD."}

This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 197 Japanese \nadult males who visited clinics for infertility consultations in 2020 and 2021. \nSemen samples were collected to measure volume, sperm count, sperm \nconcentration, and motility. Spot urine samples were collected to quantify \nphthalate monoesters, specifically phthalate diester metabolites, using liquid \nchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Serum concentrations of testosterone, \nestradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were \nobtained from clinical records. Three statistical methods-weighted quantile sum \nregression, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian kernel machine regression-were \napplied. Urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolite mixtures were positively \nassociated with sperm motility, with monoethyl phthalate being the most \nimportant contributor to the observed association. No significant associations \nwere found between phthalate mixtures and semen volume, sperm count, or \nconcentration. These associations were consistent across all three statistical \nmethods. Higher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolite mixtures were \nassociated with lower testosterone and higher prolactin concentrations in serum; \nhowever, there were no significant associations between phthalate mixtures or \nindividual phthalate metabolites and estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, or \nluteinizing hormone concentrations. Higher exposure to phthalate mixtures may be \nassociated with increased sperm motility and serum prolactin and reduced serum \ntestosterone concentrations. Overall, these findings suggest that even at a \nrelatively low level, exposure to phthalate mixtures may affect male \nreproductive health."}

Limited \nevidence suggests that MDMA may also stimulate the anterior pituitary. \nTherefore, this analysis aimed to investigate the acute effect of MDMA on the \nanterior pituitary in healthy adults.\nMETHODS: This secondary analysis utilized data from a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, crossover, randomized trial. Healthy participants received a \nsingle oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in random order. Plasma hormone \nlevels of the anterior pituitary (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], \nthyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], prolactin, growth \nhormone [GH] and their peripheral endocrine glands (cortisol, free thyroxine \n[fT4], testosterone, estradiol) were measured at baseline and 120 minutes after \ndrug-intake. Plasma hormone changes following MDMA vs placebo were compared \nusing paired Wilcoxon test.\nRESULTS: Fifteen healthy participants (median [IQR] age: 35 years [26-48]; 53% \nfemale) with a mean (SD) BMI of 23.2 kg/m2 (2.1), were included. MDMA stimulated \nthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with plasma ACTH increasing from \n12 ng/L [11, 15] at baseline to 38 ng/L [25, 59] at 120 minutes, resulting in a \nsignificant change of ACTH (p<0.001). This was accompanied by a cortisol \nincrease from 347 nmol/L [252, 409] to 566 nmol/L [457, 701], resulting in a \nsignificant change of cortisol (p=0.006). Prolactin showed a mild change of 4 \n\u00b5g/L [-1,12] (p=0.062). No effects of MDMA were observed on the remaining \nanterior pituitary axes.\nCONCLUSION: MDMA strongly activates the HPA axis, in addition to stimulating \noxytocin, suggesting that MDMA may serve as a novel stimulation test for \nassessing the two pituitary axes simultaneously. Further validation in larger \npatient populations is necessary."}

To test this, we analyzed the effects of \nthe two CK2 inhibitors CX-4945 and SGC as well as of PDX1 overexpression on SST \nexpression and secretion in RIN14B cells by qRT-PCR, luciferase assays, Western \nblot and ELISA.

Moreover, we \ndetermined the expression and secretion of the pancreatic endocrine hormones in \nCX-4945-treated mice. We found a suppressed SST expression in RIN14B cells due \nto a methylated SST promoter, which could be abolished by DNA demethylation. \nUnder these conditions, we showed that CK2 inhibition increases SST gene \nexpression and secretion. Additional experiments with overexpression of a \nCK2-phosphorylation mutant of PDX1 verified that SST expression is regulated by \nCK2. The exposure of isolated murine and human islets to CX-4945 or SGC as well \nas the treatment of mice with CX-4945 revealed that CK2 also regulates SST \nexpression under physiological conditions.

However, little is known about its application across European \ninstitutions and reasons for variable implementation.\nMETHODS: Between June and August 2024, members of the European Organisation for \nResearch and Treatment of Cancer - Brain Tumour Group (EORTC-BTG) completed a \ncross-sectional online survey on PET use in neuro-oncological practice.\nRESULTS: Overall, 103 replies from 20 countries were received. A PET facility \nwas available at 96/103 (93.2%) sites, of whom 74 (77.1%) performed PET in \npatients with brain tumours. Reasons for not performing PET included limited \navailability of tracers (14/29, 48.3%), high cost (11/29, 37.9%), and PET \nperceived unnecessary (8/29, 27.6%). Of sites performing PET, 69/74 (93.2%) \nreported use in glioma, 58/74 (78.4%) in brain metastasis, 52/74 (70.3%) in \nmeningioma, and 46/74 (62.2%) in CNS lymphoma. Amino acid PET was performed at \n62/71 centres (87.3%; 3 not reported [n.r.]), most frequently in glioma (58/59, \n98.3%, 3 n.r.) and for differentiation of treatment-related changes from tumour \nprogression (58/59, 98.3%). Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) PET was performed at \n50/68 sites (73.5%, 6 n.r.), mainly in meningioma (48/49, 98.0%), for patient \nselection before radioligand therapy (41/49, 83.7%) and for radiotherapy target \nvolume definition (33/49, 67.3%). Unrestricted coverage by statutory health \ninsurance was reported by 46/59 (78.0%) centres for amino acid PET and 33/49 \n(67.3%) for SSTR PET.\nCONCLUSION: PET use in neuro-oncology is variable across EORTC-BTG sites. \nGeneration of evidence in clinical trials and surveys including non-academic \ninstitutions are needed to guide implementation in clinical practice."}

While these circuits are known to enhance hedonic feeding behavior and \npromote weight gain, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating NPY neuron \nactivity at the translational level under the combined influence of high-fat \ndiet and stress conditions have remained poorly understood. To address this, we \nemployed translational ribosome affinity purification coupled with \nNext-Generation Sequencing (TRAPseq), allowing us to specifically identify RNA \ntranscripts actively undergoing protein translation in NPY neurons under high \nfat diet (HFD) or high fat diet combined with stress conditions (HFDS). Our \nmolecular profiling demonstrates that NPY neurons specifically co-express with \ngenes marking the orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) population, while showing \nminimal overlap with anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) markers. Gene ontology \nanalysis identified distinct clusters involved in fatty acid metabolic \nprocesses, stress response pathways, and the production of feeding-related \nneuropeptides specifically under HFDS. Immunohistochemical investigations \nrevealed in addition to local CeA (CeAm) NPY connection pathways, long-range \nprojections, to the lateral habenula (LHb), the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and \nparvicellular reticular formation (PCRt). These projections suggest a specific \nrole for CeA NPY neurons in coordinating feeding and emotional responses. \nCollectively, our findings identify specific lipid-sensing mechanisms and \nsynaptic modulating pathways as principal targets of stress within the CeA-NPY \ncircuit, revealing novel molecular mechanisms through which NPY neurons \nintegrate and process both dietary and stress signals."}

It is possible that this \nassociation is due to a direct interaction between the sympathetic and sensory \nnervous systems. This narrative review examines evidence for a potential \nsympathetic sensory interaction in deep craniofacial tissues and the trigeminal \nganglion. Research articles were identified using PubMed with the mesh terms \nadrenergic, ganglion neuron, masseter, sensory, signaling, temporomandibular and \ntrigeminal and, subsequently, from the reference lists of those articles \nidentified. The masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joint are innervated \nby sympathetic efferent fibres from the superior cervical ganglion, which \nprimarily innervates blood vessels. As trigeminal sensory afferent fibres are \noften found near blood vessels, the anatomical relationship for potential \nsympathetic sensory coupling is present in the temporomandibular joint and \nmasticatory muscles. Trigeminal afferent fibres express \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21 and \u03b22 \nadrenergic receptors as well as two of the four neuropeptide Y receptors. \nStimulation of \u03b11 receptors in the masticatory muscle mechanically sensitises \nnociceptors through a direct effect, but desensitises proprioceptors and spindle \nafferent fibres through an indirect effect on mechanosensitive organelles. \nStimulation of \u03b22 adrenergic receptors increases the mechanical activation \nthreshold of masticatory muscle afferent fibres. There is also evidence that \nstimulation of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors on immune cells contributes to nociception \nin temporomandibular joint arthritis. In contrast, \u03b11 adrenergic receptor \nactivation underlies nociception in masticatory muscle myositis. Taken together, \nthe current research provides support for the concept that sympathetic sensory \ncoupling could play a role in the pathogenesis of TMD-related pain."}

The overall goal of this study was to screen the \nefficacy of GEP12, a novel GLP-1R/Y1 receptor/Y2 receptor triple agonist, to \nreduce voluntary fentanyl taking and seeking.\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were allowed to self-administer fentanyl \n(2.5\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg-1, i.v.) for 21\u2009days. Rats were then pretreated with vehicle or GEP12 \n(1.57 or 12.53\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg-1, i.p.) prior to fentanyl self-administration test \nsessions. Opioid taking was then extinguished and rats were pretreated with \nvehicle or GEP12 (1.57 or 12.53\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg-1, i.p.) prior to subsequent reinstatement \ntest sessions.\nKEY RESULTS: GEP12 reduced fentanyl taking in both male and female rats and \nshifted the fentanyl self-administration dose-response curve downward. \nImportantly, we identified behaviourally selective doses of GEP12 that were \nwell-tolerated in fentanyl-experienced rats. GEP12 also reduced fentanyl seeking \nduring abstinence in both male and female rats at doses that did not alter food \nintake or produce adverse malaise-like effects. To identify a central mechanism \nunderlying the efficacy of GLP-1R/Y1 receptor/Y2 receptor triple agonists, we \nshowed that systemic GEP12 penetrated the brain and distributed to the \nmesolimbic reward system. Using in vivo fibre photometry, we discovered that \nGEP12 reduced fentanyl self-administration-evoked dopamine release in the \nnucleus accumbens.\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Together, these findings support the continued \ndevelopment of GLP-1R/Y1 receptor/Y2 receptor triple agonists as a novel class \nof pharmacotherapies for treating OUD."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "neuropeptide Y", "text": "Metabolic inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstriction (functional sympatholysis) \nis essential for adequate perfusion of skeletal muscle during exercise. \nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter that elicits potent vasoconstriction \nand is co-released with noradrenaline during sympathoexcitation. NPY is released \nfrom sympathetic nerves during exercise; however, no study has assessed whether \nNPY-mediated vasoconstriction is sensitive to metabolic inhibition in humans. We \ntested the hypothesis that post-junctional NPY-mediated vasoconstriction would \nbe sensitive to metabolic inhibition during handgrip exercise to a similar \ndegree as \u03b11-adrenergic vasoconstriction. In 12 healthy adults (seven male, age: \n30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years, body mass index: 24.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0kg/m2) we measured forearm blood flow \n(Doppler ultrasound), blood pressure (brachial artery catheter) and heart rate, \nand calculated changes in forearm vascular conductance (FVC) to local \nintra-arterial infusions of phenylephrine (PE; \u03b11-agonist) or NPY (Y1R-agonist) \nduring: (1) intra-arterial infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; nitric oxide \ndonor), a non-metabolic vasodilatory control, and (2) dynamic rhythmic handgrip \nexercise (EX; 15% maximal voluntary contraction). As expected, the \nvasoconstrictor response to PE was attenuated during handgrip exercise compared \nto SNP (\u0394FVC: SNP: -44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025% vs. EX: -17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Similarly, \nNPY-mediated vasoconstriction was blunted during handgrip exercise compared to \nSNP (\u0394FVC: SNP: -32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022% vs. EX: -11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.029). There was no difference \nin the magnitude of sympatholysis between PE and NPY (PE: 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018 vs. NPY: \n52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.28). NPY-mediated vasoconstriction is sensitive to metabolic \ninhibition in humans, and the magnitude of sympatholysis is not different from \n\u03b11-adrenergic vasoconstriction. KEY POINTS: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a \nneurotransmitter that is co-released from sympathetic nerve terminals and \nelicits potent vasoconstriction, particularly during periods of \nsympathoexcitation. NPY is released from sympathetic nerves during exercise, but \nit is currently unclear whether NPY-mediated vasoconstriction is sensitive to \nmetabolic inhibition in humans (i.e. functional sympatholysis). For the first \ntime we have shown that NPY-mediated vasoconstriction is sensitive to metabolic \ninhibition during exercise in healthy adults, and that the magnitude of \ninhibition is similar to the inhibition observed for \u03b11-adrenergic mediated \nvasoconstriction."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "neuropeptide Y", "text": "Bovine spastic paresis (BSP) is a progressive neuromuscular disease of unknown \norigin that causes persistent stiffness of the hind limbs. The symptoms are \nsimilar to those of human motor neuron diseases such as primary (PLS) or \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). BSP occurs worldwide in cattle production \nwith an estimated prevalence of <1%. For Germany, this means that around 20,000 \nHolstein cattle are affected. BSP is generally considered a hereditary disease, \nbut there is no prevention through breeding programs. As a result, BSP not only \naffects animal welfare but also leads to economic losses in milk and beef \nproduction. Here, we used transcriptomics to analyse the brainstem, spinal cord \nand affected gastrocnemius muscle tissue of eight animals affected by BSP and \neight control animals from slaughterhouses to gain new insights into the \nmolecular mechanisms underlying BSP. We found that the expression of several \ngenes was significantly different in animals affected by BSP compared to control \nanimals. Specific genes for inhibitory neurons were downregulated in the \nbrainstems of the affected animals, namely CCK (cholecystokinin), NPY \n(neuropeptide Y), and SST (somatostatin). These inhibitory neurotransmitters \ninfluence cerebral movement control, among other processes. Furthermore, OOSP2 \n(oocyte secreted protein 2) was found to be significantly upregulated in the \naffected animals in all tissues. This expression could best be explained by the \npresence of T-follicular-helper cells which, through interleukin 21, can trigger \na TH-2-dominated immune response and lead to autoimmune encephalitis. Further \ncases were sampled for confirmation and we detected cell infiltrates of \nactivated microglia and T-cells in the brainstem using immunohistochemistry. \nMicroglial foci were significantly more abundant in animals affected by BSP than \ncontrol animals. We conclude that BSP is caused by an autoimmune reaction \ndirected against inhibitory interneurons in the brainstem and is due to a \ncombination of genetics and environmental influences. This may result in lost \ncontrolling influence on the upper motor neurons via extrapyramidal pathways and \ntherefore triggers the specific symptoms of motor neuron disease."}

The severity of COVID-19 varies, ranging from \nasymptomatic cases to mild symptoms, acute respiratory failure and death. \nGenetic factors are believed to influence individual responses to the virus. \nThis study investigates the association between two common single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNPs) in Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-TLR2 rs3804099 (+597 C/T) and \nTLR4 rs4986790 (+896 A/G)-and disease severity and inflammatory markers in \nMoroccan COVID-19 patients. A total of 452 COVID-19 patients (259 with \nmild/moderate disease and 193 with severe disease) were included. TLR2 and TLR4 \nSNPs were genotyped using a predesigned TaqMan real-time allelic discrimination \nassay. Complete blood count samples, along with levels of C-reactive protein \n(CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin and D-dimer, were assessed using automated \nmethods. No significant associations were observed between either SNP in TLR2 \nand TLR4 and disease severity under various genetic models. However, in severe \ncases, TLR4 rs4986790 showed a significant association with ferritin levels \n(p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) and lymphocyte count (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). TLR2 rs3804099 was linked to CRP \nlevels in severe patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). No associations were observed with \nanti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG or anti-N IgG levels in severe cases \n(p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). These findings suggest that although TLR4 and TLR2 polymorphisms are \nnot directly associated with COVID-19 severity, they may influence the \ninflammatory response. Specifically, TLR4 rs4986790 and TLR2 rs3804099 appear to \nmodulate ferritin and CRP levels, potentially impacting disease progression in \nsevere cases."}

Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients \naged 35-70\u00a0years, those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and \nthose treated with glimepiride 4\u00a0mg. Exclusion criteria were as follows: other \ntypes of diabetes, pregnancy, abnormal liver or kidney function tests, using \nother anti-diabetes medications, and non-adherence to medications. At baseline \nand after three months of intervention, anthropometric measurements were \nmeasured, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of blood \nglucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, hs-CRP, fetuin-A, and \nsirtuin 1.

Among child and adolescent \npatients, significant differences in dose-adjusted serum concentration (C/D) \nvalues (P\u2009=\u20090.0291) were observed across different CYP2C19 phenotypes, with PMs \nexhibiting higher C/D values. In a cohort of 593 patients who underwent \nhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) testing, a nonlinear, U-shaped \ncorrelation between hsCRP levels and sertraline concentrations was identified in \nchildren and adolescents.\nDISCUSSION: By identifying key factors such as daily dose, sex and AST levels, \nclinicians can develop tailored treatment plans for individual patients. These \nfindings underscore the need for further research to elucidate the interplay \nbetween sertraline metabolism and patients' physiological and pathological \ncharacteristics."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "C reactive protein", "text": "BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is crucial but remains \nchallenging. Cell Population Data (CPD) provide high-resolution phenotyping of \nleukocytes, offering potential for sepsis detection. We aimed to establish \nneonatal CPD reference intervals and explore their capacity to detect sepsis and \nnecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).\nMETHODS: CPD from neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were analyzed in \nhospitalized newborns. Reference intervals (5-95th percentiles), at birth and \nduring the first 28 days, were derived from newborns without conditions \npotentially impacting CPD (reference group). The performance of CPD in detecting \nblood culture-proven sepsis/NEC was evaluated against complete blood count (CBC) \nand C-reactive protein (CRP).\nRESULTS: Reference intervals from 905 neonates showed that mean CPD values \nfollowed distinct trajectories for each parameter, while distribution width \ngenerally decreased with increasing gestational and postnatal age. CPD in 39 \nsepsis/NEC cases, obtained on the day of clinical suspicion or from the closest \nCBC, differed from those in the reference group, particularly neutrophil \nfluorescence intensity (NE-SFL) (56.2 vs. 41.1 arbitrary units, P\u2009<\u20090.001). \nNE-SFL had superior accuracy compared to other CPD, CBC, and CRP, with 90% \nsensitivity and 76% specificity.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study establishes neonatal CPD reference intervals and \nidentifies NE-SFL as a potential sepsis biomarker.\nIMPACT: This study establishes reference intervals for neonatal leukocyte Cell \nPopulation Data (CPD), providing a valuable resource for interpreting these \npreclinical parameters in newborns. Our findings highlight the impact of \ngestational and postnatal age on neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte \nmorphology, contributing to a better understanding of neonatal immune \ndevelopment. In an exploratory analysis, CPD parameters, particularly NE-SFL, \nhad superior diagnostic accuracy for sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis \ncompared to traditional biomarkers. As CPD are automatically generated with CBC, \nthey offer a cost-effective, real-time, and objective tool with potential for \nimproving neonatal sepsis detection."}

We performed a multivariate regression \nanalysis including the following variables: age, sex, duration of fever, maximum \ntemperature, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and C reactive protein and \nprocalcitonin levels.\nRESULTS: We included 2391 infants in the study. The UC was positive in 177 \n(7.4%; 13.5% in males vs 0.6% in females). The main isolated microorganisms were \nEscherichia coli (83, 46.9%), Enterococcus faecalis (40, 22.6%) and Klebsiella \nspp (24, 13.6%).

FGF23-positive cells were detected \nin damaged glandular and interglandular areas representing mucus-like cells, \nendothelial cells of interconnected blood vessels or stromal endothelial cells \nand myofibroblasts. FGF23 expression was associated with impaired tissue \nintegrity, immune cell infiltration and lipid deposition, with less pronounced \nmucosal changes upon short-term HFD feeding. Gastric FGF23 was also detectable \nin patients with obesity, mainly in endothelial cells of dilated and \ninterconnected vessels. In HUVECs, pro-angiogenic adipokine leptin ramped up \nFGF23 transcript levels. In GES-1 cells, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 \n(IL-1\u03b2) tended to enhance FGF23 expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: HFD feeding stimulates gastric FGF23 production and, in particular, \nincreases the number of FGF23-expressing endothelial and epithelial cells."}

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "growth hormone", "text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited \nresponsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or \nrecurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an \nindolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, \nhighlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, \ntrametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein \nkinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 \n(CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the \nrepurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast \ncancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to \nimprove outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes \nevidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer \ntherapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of \nrapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian \ncancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG \n281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, \nmolecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, \nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, \nand CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer \nprovide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies \ndemonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when \ncombined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 \ninhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the \nresponse to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin \ninhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the \nimportance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and \nendocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade \nserous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited \ntreatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates \nprecise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies \nleveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical \nfor refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National \nComprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients \nwith hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer."}

The genome of F. fujikuroi harbors numerous \nsecondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters that divert acetyl-CoA away from \nthe GA3 pathway, thereby limiting its yield. To address this challenge, we \nemployed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete the bikaverin and fusarubin \nbiosynthesis gene clusters, which are known to compete with GA3 biosynthesis for \nacetyl-CoA. This genetic intervention resulted in a substantial increase in GA3 \nproduction, with the \u0394BIK\u0394FSR strain yielding 31.67\u202f% more GA3 compared to the \nwild-type strain. Notably, the deletion of these gene clusters not only enhanced \nGA3 biosynthesis but also improved mycelial growth and carbon assimilation, as \nevidenced by increased consumption of reducing sugars during fermentation. We \nfurther employed qRT-PCR to assess comparative expression levels of genes \nassociated with the glycohydrolysis, glycolysis, and the TCA pathway in \nengineered strain. Results indicated that removing by-product gene clusters \nenhances the glycohydrolase system, accelerating carbon assimilation.

Additionally, while only a few lymphocytes were \nobserved in the combs of the large-comb group, focal lymphocyte aggregation was \nevident in the small-comb group. Circulating growth hormone (GH) and \ntestosterone levels were significantly higher in chickens with large combs, \nparticularly in roosters, where testosterone levels showed a significant \ncorrelation with testicular weight. It was observed that the GH levels were \nsignificantly correlated with comb development, independent of sex. Correlation \nanalysis indicated a trade-off between comb size and carcass yield, suggesting \nthat resource allocation favors ornamentation and reproductive system over meat \nproduction. These findings provide insights into the biological significance of \ncomb development, emphasizing its potential as a marker for reproductive fitness \nand immunomodulatory functions in poultry breeding."}

In recent years, there has been significant progress in \nunderstanding the molecular pathogenesis and biology of these tumors. The first \ntargeted IDH-inhibitor was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in \nAugust 2024 for grade 2 gliomas, in light of results of a phase III trial which \nshowed significant advantages in progression-free survival. However, biologic \ntherapy is not curative, and subsequent treatment options offer only limited \nclinical benefit and often result in long-term toxicities. In addition, targeted \ntreatment options for grade 3 and grade 4 IDH-mutant gliomas are still missing. \nIn this study, we present n=52 patients with glioma (grade 2, 3 and 4) with \nconfirmed IDH1 mutation (mutIDH1) in the newly diagnosed and recurrent setting \nwho, in addition to standard-of-care, received a personalized \nneoantigen-targeting peptide vaccine. Each tumor was initially analyzed for \nsomatic mutations by whole exome sequencing, and a peptide vaccine containing \npotential neoepitopes was designed, manufactured and vaccinated. Each vaccine \nconsisted of peptides derived from numerous somatic mutations, including at \nleast one peptide targeting the mutIDH1.Vaccine immunogenicity was determined by \nintracellular cytokine staining and simultaneous measurement of four T-cell \nactivation markers (Interferon-\u03b3, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Interleukin-2, CD154) \nafter 12-day in vitro expansion of pre and post vaccination peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells. Extracellular CD154 staining was used to sort \nmutIDH1-specific CD4+T cells.Immunomonitoring revealed that the vaccines were \nimmunogenic and induced mainly CD4 but also CD8 T cell responses. \nVaccine-induced immune responses were robust and polyfunctional. Immunogenicity \nagainst mutIDH1 was high (89%). We implemented an assay which allowed us to \nisolate functional antigen-specific CD4+T cells in an HLA-independent manner. \nSubsequent T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing revealed that CD4+T cells \nreacting on mutIDH1 stimulation were polyclonal. Strikingly, we detected two \nmutIDH1-specific TCR\u03b2 candidate sequences in three different patients. These \nthree patients had the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQA-DQB alleles. The \nobtained TCR\u03b2 sequences could be tracked in autologous ex-vivo single-cell \ntranscriptomic data. Our results provide a rationale for pursuing vaccination \nand T cell transfer strategies targeting IDH1. Furthermore, our findings \nindicate that personalized neoantigen-targeting vaccines might be considered for \nthe treatment of IDH1-mutant gliomas."}

It is commonly used to \nmanage liver fibrosis (LF). However, the precise antifibrotic mechanism of \nlevistilide A (LA), the major bioactive constituent of Danggui, remains largely \nunexplored.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the inhibitory effects of LA on nitric oxide \n(NO) production in M1 macrophages and to elucidate its anti-LF property.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using lipopolysaccharide/interferon-\u03b3-activated RAW264.7 \nmacrophages for in vitro studies to investigate LA's repressive effects on \nnuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/NO axis in M1 \nmacrophages. Additionally, using CCl4-induced LF mice for in vivo studies to \nexplore LA's therapeutic mechanism on LF via restraining the NF-\u03baB/iNOS/NO axis.\nRESULTS: LA markedly attenuated p65 activation in M1 macrophages, leading to a \ndose-dependent suppression of iNOS expression, and a concomitant reduction in NO \nproduction. In CCl4-induced fibrotic mice, LA administration resulted in a \nsignificant reduction in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate \naminotransferase and NO, mitigating hepatic tissue injury and collagen \ndeposition. Furthermore, LA downregulated the hepatic expression of iNOS, tumour \nnecrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, \nwhile upregulating interleukin-10 and matrix metalloproteinase-12. Additionally, \nLA significantly reduced the hepatic protein expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle \nactin, CD86, p65, p-p65 and iNOS, further supporting its antifibrotic efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS: LA exerts antifibrotic effects by suppressing NO overproduction \nthrough inhibition of the NF-\u03baB/iNOS signalling pathway in M1 macrophages, \nthereby demonstrating therapeutic potential in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis."}

Further, the impact of \ndiscontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on inflammation is not well \nunderstood for postpartum women. We studied the relationship of ART \ndiscontinuation, inflammation, and HIV disease progression in postpartum WHIV.\nSETTING: We conducted a 1:3 case-control study (N=347) nested within a \nmulti-country randomized trial comparing postpartum ART continuation vs. \ndiscontinuation in WHIV with WHO clinical stage 1 disease and who did not meet \ncriteria for ART at the time. Median follow-up time was 97.1 weeks.\nMETHODS: Cases were defined as WHIV who progressed to HIV disease stage 2 or \ngreater during follow-up. Controls were selected using a risk set sampling \nstrategy. Plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers interleukin-6 (IL-6), \ninterferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), intestinal fatty \nacid-binding protein (I-FABP), soluble CD14(sCD14) and CD163 (sCD163) before \n(i.e., baseline) and 4 weeks after randomization were measured using \nimmunoassays. Weighted multivariable regression models assessed the association \nbetween inflammation with HIV disease progression, by randomization arm (ART \ncontinuation vs. discontinuation).\nRESULTS: Postpartum WHIV with higher levels of baseline I-FABP and persistently \nhigh levels of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 had increased hazards of HIV disease progression. \nSignificantly larger increases in I-FABP and sCD14, and smaller increases in \nTNF\u03b1 and sCD163 between baseline and week 4 were observed for postpartum \nparticipants who continued ART than among those who discontinued ART.\nCONCLUSION: Postpartum WHIV with higher levels of immune biomarkers have \nincreased hazards of HIV disease progression, suggesting an important role for \ninflammation in HIV treatment outcomes. Our results showed that continuation of \nART compared to discontinuation had differential impacts on various immune \nmarkers, with the discontinuation results relevant in settings of poor \nadherence, or treatment interruption."}

Research shows that \ndisruptions in the metabolism of arginine, glutamate, branched\u2011chain amino acids \n(BCAAs) and tryptophan exacerbate CHD inflammation via immunometabolic \nreprogramming and oxidative stress. Nitric oxide (NO), produced from arginine \nmetabolism, regulates CHD progression multifacetedly. Glutamate metabolism \ndysregulation harms cardiovascular health, while glutamine exerts \ncardioprotective effects after myocardial infarction. Elevated BCAA levels are \nassociated with atherosclerosis development, and tryptophan and its metabolites \nhave complex effects on CHD. Notably, amino acid metabolism intersects with the \nimmune system, modulating the functions of T cells, B cells and macrophages. \nThese immune cells are crucial for CHD\u2011related inflammation. Inflammatory \nmarkers like high\u2011sensitivity C\u2011reactive protein, interleukin family members, \ninterferon\u2011\u03b3 and monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20111 are closely linked to CHD \npathogenesis and progression, facilitating risk assessment. Clinical research, \nincluding animal and human studies, and technological applications such as \nmetabolomics, offer insights into CHD diagnosis, treatment and prevention. \nDietary intervention and drug therapy targeting amino acid metabolism show \npotential. For example, L\u2011arginine supplementation has cardioprotective effects \nand novel NO donors like compound\u2011N6 hold promise. However, certain substances \nlike triclocarban have adverse impacts, while colchicine is beneficial. In \nsummary, while current research has advanced the understanding of CHD, \nsignificant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding rare amino acids and \nthe connection between amino acid metabolism and non\u2011coding RNA.

Dicer1 inactivation interfered with this trajectory and \nstalled TAMs at an intermediate state, impeding immunosuppressive and M2-like \nTAM development. This reprogramming translated into enhanced response to \nantiangiogenic immunotherapy in an orthotopic lung cancer model. Cycling/M2-like \nmacrophages are conserved in mouse and human cancers and are enriched in \npatients with poor response to immunotherapy, making them a more selective \ntherapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs."}

After administering an \nanti-CD3\u03b5 activating antibody to C57Bl/6 mice to induce a T cell memory \nrepertoire, we compared the pulmonary immune response to CLP in these \n\"Immune-Educated mice\" to responses observed in Uneducated control animals. \nCompared to Uneducated mice, 24 hours after CLP, Immune-Educated mice had higher \nalveolar inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations and more pulmonary \ninterstitial macrophages. After 48 hours, the proportion of effector CD4 T cells \nthat produced interferon-gamma was greater in Immune- Educated mice. After 72 \nhours, there were more alveolar macrophages in the lungs of Educated mice. \nSeparately, we performed adoptive transfer of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells from \nimmunized C57Bl/6J to B6.SJL mice and IFN\u03b3 blockade at the time of CLP. \nInterstitial macrophage recruitment 24 hours post-CLP was more pronounced in \nmice undergoing adoptive transfer of memory T cells compared to mice that did \nnot undergo adoptive transfer.

Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people \nwith MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing \ndisease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern \nfor risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral \nproduction of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the \naging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA.\nMETHODS: We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 \nwho enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 \nparticipants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and \ncultured with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24\u00a0h. We assayed cell \nculture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) \nusing Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples \nusing a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations \nbetween age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and \nMBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted \nlinear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to \nwhich MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR.\nRESULTS: Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% \nnon-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (\u03b2=-0.003, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among the \nsubgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, \nIL-17 production declined with age in women (\u03b2=-0.27, p\u2009=\u20090.04) but not men \n(\u03b2=-0.1, p\u2009=\u20090.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association \nbetween older age and lower ARR (24.6% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory \nanalyses, older pwMS (\u2265\u200950 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, \nPDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several \ncytokines than younger pwMS (<\u200950 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) \nmediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR.\nCONCLUSION: Diminished peripheral IL-17 response as a potential biological \nmechanism underlying the aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA warrants \nfurther investigation."}

Currently, there is no precise scientific definition for the \ncondition, which is often accompanied with a poor clinical prognosis.

A clinical multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaborated with \nbioinformaticians to provide precise treatment and elucidate the biological \nmechanisms underpinning this growth.\nMETHODS: A 28-year-old male patient diagnosed with colon cancer experienced \nexplosive tumor growth. Peripheral bloods (PB) during immunotherapy were \ncollected for immune cytokine analyses and flow cytometry assays on immune cell \nsubsets. To further examine the underlying mechanisms of this explosive-growth, \nwe conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of \nsamples taken at different time points.\nRESULTS: The patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. We implemented an \nimmunotherapy and performed PB immune cytokine assays before, during, and after \nthis therapy. Our observations suggested that immunotherapy may remodel \ninterferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) signaling and enhance T cell-mediated immune responses. \nBy exploring explosive tumor growth mechanisms, we observed that tumors had \nsignificantly less insertion and deletion (INDEL) mutations and INDEL-derived \nneoantigens. Additionally, they had deficient antigen presentation functions as \ncharacterized by decreased IFN-\u03b3 signaling activity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Neoantigen loss and decreased IFN-\u03b3 signaling activity contributed \nto explosive tumor growth in this patient.

Through \nintegrated analysis of single-cell transcription sequence data, we identified \naberrant upregulation of Lamin B2 (LMNB2) specifically in \nimmunotherapy-sensitive HCC patients. Functional characterization revealed that \nLMNB2 acts as a transcriptional regulator of PD-L1, potentiating immune escape \nmechanisms in HCC cells during co-culture with Jurkat cells.

Clinically relevant SPOP mutations or \nreduced SPOP expression impaired this regulatory mechanism, leading to LMNB2 \naccumulation and subsequent PD-L1 hyperactivation. Importantly, combinatorial \ntargeting of LMNB2 with Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) displayed a synergistic \neffect on suppressing tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo, particularly \nin HCC models with SPOP mutations or LMNB2 overexpression.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 38 (USP38) has been \nimplicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. \nHowever, its role in CKD-related ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is yet to be \nclarified. This research systematically explores the involvement of USP38 in the \ndevelopment of VAs in CKD.\nMETHODS: This study employed cardiac-specific Usp38 knockout and transgenic \nUsp38 mice, along with H9c2 cells transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying \nUsp38 (AdUsp38) or shRNA targeting Usp38 (AdshUsp38). The mouse model was \ngenerated via 5/6 nephrectomy, and CKD cell models were created using indoxyl \nsulfate (IS) induction. These models underwent extensive evaluation, including \nechocardiography, electrophysiology, histological studies, and molecular \nanalysis.\nRESULTS: In CKD mouse models, USP38 expression was markedly elevated and \npredominantly localized in ventricular myocytes. Knocking out Usp38 markedly \ndecreased the susceptibility and duration of rapid VAs in CKD mice and corrected \nthe abnormal expression of ion channel proteins. Comparable findings were \nobserved in Usp38 transgenic mouse models. From a mechanistic perspective, Usp38 \nknockout reduced oxidative stress in cardiac tissues and upregulated \nantioxidative enzyme expression. The enhancement was mainly achieved by \nincreasing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) ubiquitination and degradation, along with \ninhibition of downstream CaMKII activity. In contrast, USP38 overexpression had \nharmful effects on the heart, which were alleviated by NOX4 inhibition.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that USP38 stabilizes NOX4 expression via \ndeubiquitination, resulting in increased oxidative stress and \nhyperphosphorylation of CaMKII, which markedly enhances the susceptibility of \nCKD mice to VAs. These findings underscore the critical regulatory role of USP38 \nin CKD-related arrhythmias, providing a promising therapeutic target for \nUSP38-directed treatments."}

This study aimed to investigate the effect of casitas \nB-lineage lymphoma (CBL)-mediated aquaporin 1 (AQP1) ubiquitination on KYDS.\nMETHODS: The KYDS rat model was induced via intraperitoneal injection of \nhydrocortisone. Body weight, body temperature, sperm motility, serum hormone \nlevels, organ indices, and histopathological changes\u00a0of rats were evaluated. \nAQP1 was knocked down to detect the effect of AQP1 on lipid metabolism in KYDS \nrats. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation were used to verify the \nrelationship between CBL and AQP1, and CBL knockdown KYDS rats were constructed \nto test the effect of CBL on AQP1 ubiquitination.\nRESULTS: AQP1 expression was downregulated in KYDS rats. Knockdown of the AQP1 \ngene in KYDS rats resulted in decreased body weight, body temperature, sperm \nmotility, and testicular index, along with increased renal index. It also \nresulted in changes of serum hormone levels and exacerbated pathologic changes. \nAdditionally, AQP1 knockdown further suppressed lipid accumulation in KYDS rats, \nas evidenced by reductions in lipid droplets and the expression of lipid \nsynthesis proteins. Intriguingly, elevated expression of CBL was observed in \nKYDS, and its knockdown inhibited the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AQP1. \nThe inhibition of CBL in KYDS improved lipid metabolism dysregulation, thereby \nameliorating KYDS.\nCONCLUSION: CBL-mediated AQP1 ubiquitination aggravates KYDS by promoting lipid \nmetabolism dysregulation, offering promising insights for targeted therapeutic \ninterventions."}

While fatty acid (FA) metabolism can potentiate tumorigenesis, \ncolonization, and metastasis, the roles of lncRNAs in reprograming FA metabolism \nand regulating gastric cancer (GC) metastasis remain elusive.\nMETHODS: Whole RNA-sequencing and in silico analyses were conducted to identify \nclinically significant lncRNAs involved in GC metastasis. Among the identified \nlncRNAs, we focused on the novel lncRNA TENM3-AS1. RT-qPCR and FISH analyses \nrevealed an increased expression of TENM3-AS1 in GC cell lines and patients. In \nvitro and in vivo functional experiments validated the effects of TENM3-AS1 to \nGC metastasis and the reprogramming of FA metabolism. ChIP, Biotinylated RNA \npull-down, RIP, CHX-chase assay, ubiquitination assay, and RNA stabilization \nassay were employed to perceive the mechanisms underlying the effects of \nTENM3-AS1 in GC cells.\nRESULTS: TENM3-AS1 expression was significantly elevated in metastatic tumors \nand advanced primary tumors of GC patients. This increased expression was also \nassociated with a worsened overall survival and progression-free survival. \nFunctionally, TENM3-AS1 enhanced the migration and invasiveness of GC cells in \nvitro, promoted tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo, and increased FA \nbiosynthesis in GC cells. Mechanistically, our studies showed that the \ntranscription factor EGR1 activated TENM3-AS1, which in turn upregulated the \nexpression of FASN and hnRNPK. Furthermore, TENM3-AS1 interacted with and \nstabilized hnRNPK by increasing its deubiquitination. This interaction \nreprogrammed FA metabolism and promoted GC progression by increasing FASN mRNA \nstability through hnRNPK.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, by comparing lncRNA sequencing data from paired \nprimary and peritoneal metastatic tumors and public transcriptome data from \nnon-metastatic and metastatic samples, we clarified a novel lncRNA, TENM3-AS1. \nIt was found that TENM3-AS1 was aberrantly activated in metastatic and advanced \nprimary tumors, and was strongly correlated with a shorter survival in GC \npatients. Our study reveals the EGR1/TENM3-AS1/ hnRNPK/FASN axis as a novel \ncurative target in metastatic GC."}

Metastasis contributes \nsignificantly to cancer morbidity and mortality. Gilteritinib showed anticancer \nactivity against lung and colorectal cancer but has not been thoroughly \ninvestigated for its potential in PCa therapy. This study evaluated the \nanticancer effects of gilteritinib on PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) by \nassessing cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. \nMechanistic studies were conducted to determine its impact on the cell cycle, \nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. \nAdditionally, the mode of cell death was explored, focusing on endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) stress and protein ubiquitination. Gilteritinib exhibited \ndose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited PCa cell proliferation, colony \nformation, and migration. It induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest by \ndownregulating CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin E1. EMT modulation was observed through \nthe suppression of vimentin, N-cadherin, and Twist, along with increased \nE-cadherin expression. This EMT inhibition correlated with the downregulation of \nWnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling components. Notably, gilteritinib triggered a \nnon-apoptotic, non-autophagic cell death characterized by cytoplasmic \nvacuolation, ER stress, and protein ubiquitination, requiring new protein \nsynthesis. This effect was mediated through the activation of the unfolded \nprotein response (UPR) via the PERK pathway. Gilteritinib demonstrates \nsignificant anticancer potential in PCa by inducing cell cycle arrest, \ninhibiting EMT, suppressing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, and triggering a unique \nmode of cell death via ER stress. These findings highlight gilteritinib as a \npromising therapeutic candidate for PCa treatment."}

Therefore, SMAD5 may be a key regulator of BMSCs \nosteogenic differentiation, and its more related molecular mechanisms are worth \nfurther revealing.

SMAD5 silencing suppressed viability, invasion and osteogenic \ndifferentiation of BMSCs, while its overexpression had opposite effects.

Moreover, USP53 \nknockdown inhibited viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, \nwhile these effects were reverted by SMAD5 overexpression.
