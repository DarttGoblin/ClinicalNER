{"text": "To conduct a multi-study, cross-country examination of diabetes stigma among adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D). Pre-existing, cross-sectional studies of adults (aged â¥18) completing the T1D or T2D Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scales (DSAS-1/DSAS-2) were collated. Descriptive statistics were calculated for (sub)scale and item scores. Variance-components linear random-effect multi-level modelling (nested random intercepts for country and study) estimated overall mean (sub)scale scores, 95% confidence intervals, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% prediction intervals. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests provided inference for country- and study-specific heterogeneity. Eleven studies were included from six countries (Australia k = 2, Canada k = 1, Japan k = 2, New Zealand k = 1, UAE k = 1, USA k = 4) in four languages (Arabic k = 1, English k = 7, Japanese k = 2, Spanish k = 1). Six studies included n = 3114 adults with T1D (insulin pump: 42%; 75% aged <60 years). Ten studies included n = 6586 adults with T2D (insulin-treated: 37%; 44% aged <60 years). Most reported â¥1 experience of diabetes stigma (T1D = 91%; study range: 84%-96%; T2D = 77%; 69%-89%). In 10 studies, the 'blame and judgment' subscale was most endorsed (T1D = 83%; 62%-89%, T2D = 70%; 53%-79%). Most adults with T1D reported 'identity concerns' (73%; 62%-80%), and 47% of adults with T2D reported 'self-stigma' (30-60%). Being 'treated differently' was least common (T1D = 46%; 40%-54%, T2D = 37%; 28%-47%).

{"text": "The growth of premature infants is expected to be equivalent to healthy fetal growth, but this is rarely achieved in practice. It is predicted that many premature infants, especially severe premature infants, will be discharged with growth restriction. Extrauterine growth retardation (EUGR) is defined as growth below the 10th percentile of the growth curve at discharge at corrected 36th/40th week of gestation, or a difference between birth and discharge z-score > 1 SD. The aim of our study is to determine the differences between the INTERGROWTH-21ST and the Fenton chart in the assessment of extrauterine growth. Infants < 1500 g born or transferred in the first 24 h at Ankara University NICU between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 were included. Infants with major congenital anomalies, unknown gestational age, chromosomal anomalies, hydrops fetalis, TORCH infection, infants born to substance abusing mothers, and infants who died during hospitalization were excluded. According to the Fenton, the rate of EUGR at discharge was 66.3%. There was no significant difference between the groups EUGR and non-EUGR in gender, gestational diabetes, maternal smoking during pregnancy, placental abruption, magnesium sulphate prophylaxis, development of respiratory distress, and need for intubation in the first 3 days after birth. When patients were grouped according to birth weight, the highest rate of EUGR according to the Fenton was found in the group with a birth weight â¤ 1000 g (78.8%) (p = 0.036). The proportion of patients defined as SGA by INTERGROWTH-21ST was significantly higher than by Fenton (p < 0.001). Comparing the mean z scores for body weight, height and head circumference at birth and discharge calculated from the Fenton and INTERGROWTH-21 charts, the z scores for body weight and height at birth and discharge were significantly lower in the INTERGROWTH-21 (p < 0.001). Head circumference z-scores at birth and discharge were found to be higher in the Fenton chart than in the INTERGROWTH-21ST (p < 0.001). When EUGR rates were evaluated by body weight in Fenton and INTERGROWTH-21ST, the EUGR rate was found to be higher in Fenton (p < 0.001). The results show that when INTERGROWTH-21ST and Fenton are compared, INTERGROWTH-21ST is more sensitive in defining the SGA rate. The Fenton is more sensitive in defining EUGR at discharge. These differences between the charts make it difficult to monitor the growth of premature infants and to follow comorbidities. Therefore, the establishment of ideal growth curves is of great importance both during hospitalization and after discharge of premature infants.", "entities": [{"entity": "GROWTH RETARDATION", "start": 267, "end": 284, "matched_text": "GROWTH RETARDATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GESTATION", "start": 404, "end": 412, "matched_text": "GESTATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HYDROPS FETALIS", "start": 851, "end": 865, "matched_text": "HYDROPS FETALIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HYDROPS FETALIS", "start": 851, "end": 865, "matched_text": "HYDROPS FETALIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GESTATIONAL DIABETES", "start": 1137, "end": 1156, "matched_text": "GESTATIONAL DIABETES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GESTATIONAL DIABETES", "start": 1137, "end": 1156, "matched_text": "GESTATIONAL DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PLACENTAL ABRUPTION", "start": 1194, "end": 1212, "matched_text": "PLACENTAL ABRUPTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PLACENTAL ABRUPTION", "start": 1194, "end": 1212, "matched_text": "PLACENTAL ABRUPTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RESPIRATORY DISTRESS", "start": 1262, "end": 1281, "matched_text": "RESPIRATORY DISTRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SGA", "start": 1557, "end": 1559, "matched_text": "SGA", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Despite advances in pharmacological treatments, diabetes mellitus remains a significant global health challenge, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and associated metabolic dysfunctions. Effective and sustainable glycemic control remains elusive, prompting exploration into unconventional sources of metabolic insights. Social insects, in particular bees and ants, exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations enabling them to thrive on carbohydrate-rich diets without developing metabolic disorders typical in humans. This review investigates the bees and ants metabolic strategies to avoid metabolic disorders like diabetes, focusing on their enzymatic pathways such as trehalose metabolism, specialized hormonal regulation involving insulin-like peptides, adipokinetic hormones, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning their metabolic resilience. By systematically comparing these insect adaptations with human metabolic systems, the proposed study identifies potential translational applications, including engineered probiotics, gene-editing approaches, and bioactive compounds for diabetes management. Furthermore, it explores technical, ethical, and ecological considerations for translating insect-derived metabolic mechanisms into human therapies.

{"text": "The role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains controversial. This study aimed to delineate the subgroup-specific relationships between the two by exploring cumulative and threshold effects. 3,040 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline evidence of DKD were included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to investigate the potential relationship between HDL-C level and DKD risk. To address subgroup heterogeneity, sex-stratified restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to model nonlinear relationships. The optimal threshold was identified through the maximum selected statistics and validated via 1,000 bootstrap iterations. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, diabetes duration, and metabolic status were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves further validated these threshold effects. During a median follow-up of 3.13 years, 665 subjects (21.9%) progressed to DKD. Overall, each 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level independently reduced DKD risk by 43%. RCS analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between HDL-C and DKD risk (P for overall = 0.025, P for nonlinear = 0.317), with increased risk reduction at lower concentrations, plateauing at higher levels. A robust threshold of 0.93 mmol/L was identified, showing significantly stronger protection against DKD progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69, P < 0.001) compared to the traditional cutoff (HR = 0.86, P = 0.109).

Elevated inflammatory markers, acute hyperglycaemia and evidence of cardio-hepatic damage were identified in T2D patients. db/db mice exhibited analogous T2D-associated pathophysiology, including increased ischemia-reperfusion injury exacerbated by metabolic disturbances in the myocardium, liver, and skeletal muscle versus non-diabetic controls. In diabetic women, multiple factors beyond reperfusion delays exacerbate acute myocardial injury. This necessitates the development of sex-specific strategies to manage the cardiovascular complications of diabetic HFpEF. The db/db mouse model provides a relevant preclinical tool for future research as it mimics human T2D-associated HFpEF and STEMI outcome.", "entities": [{"entity": "HEART FAILURE", "start": 1, "end": 13, "matched_text": "HEART FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEART FAILURE", "start": 1, "end": 13, "matched_text": "HEART FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "start": 248, "end": 268, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "start": 248, "end": 268, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROLONGED", "start": 333, "end": 341, "matched_text": "PROLONGED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE", "start": 672, "end": 694, "matched_text": "CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CAD", "start": 697, "end": 699, "matched_text": "CAD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TYPE 2 DIABETES", "start": 705, "end": 719, "matched_text": "TYPE 2 DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 1068, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ISCHEMIA", "start": 1150, "end": 1157, "matched_text": "ISCHEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 1196, "end": 1200, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 1203, "end": 1207, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "IMPAIRED LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION", "start": 1296, "end": 1329, "matched_text": "IMPAIRED LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 1331, "end": 1334, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ICD", "start": 1396, "end": 1398, "matched_text": "ICD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 1570, "end": 1577, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1597, "end": 1602, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXACERBATED BY", "start": 1748, "end": 1761, "matched_text": "EXACERBATED BY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIUM", "start": 1793, "end": 1802, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIUM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 1997, "end": 1999, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}]}

A cohort of 449 asymptomatic T2DM patients was categorized into four groups: those without DN(G0) and those with DN, which was further subdivided into stages G1, G2, and G3. Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left atrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains during the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we investigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN group were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death. (1) Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic data for left ventricular size or function across groups. (2) Correlation analysis after multivariable adjustment revealed that the LA minimal volume index (LAVImin) increased with the progression of DN, while the absolute value of the LA strain index(reservoir and conduit period) decreased as renal damage worsened, exhibiting a highly significant correlation with the GFR (P < 0.01). (3) Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that: LAVmin, LASr, GFR, and HbA1c were associated with MACEs in patients with DN. Incorporating LAVmin and LASr into the basic model significantly enhanced the predictive value for MACEs in DN patients (with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.818, sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of 85.4%). The increase in LA volume and weakened reservoir and conduit function in T2DM patients dynamically reflect the severity of renal damage. LAVImin and LASr are associated with the occurrence of MACEs in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes patients with early renal damage.

While children's physiology and activity patterns differ from those of adults in ways that are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to such endpoints, research gaps remain regarding the specific impacts of EHEs on child health. This study evaluated pediatric emergency healthcare utilizations associated with EHEs in Ontario. Applying a space-time stratified case-crossover design, associations between EHEs (same-day or lagged exposure to 2 consecutive days of daily maximum temperatures above percentile thresholds) and 15 causes of pediatric emergency healthcare use in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2015 were analysed using conditional quasi-Poisson regression. In primary analyses, EHEs were defined as two or more consecutive days with temperatures above the 99th percentile of temperature within each respective forward sortation area (FSA). Emergency healthcare use was measured using hospital admissions as an indicator of severe outcomes, and emergency department (ED) visits as a sensitive measure of outcomes. Relative to non-EHE days, EHEs increased the rates of pediatric hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses by 26% (95% CI: 14-40%), asthma by 29% (16-44%); infectious and parasitic diseases by 36% (24-50%), lower respiratory infections by 50% (36-67%), and enteritis by 19% (7-32%). EHEs also increased the rates of ED visits for lower respiratory infections by 10% (0-21%), asthma by 18% (7-29%), heat-related illnesses by 211% (193-230%), heatstroke by 590% (550-622%), and dehydration by 35% (25-46%), but not for other causes. Admissions and ED visits due to injuries and transportation related injuries were negatively associated with EHEs. Neither all-cause hospital admissions nor ED visits were associated with EHEs. In Ontario, EHEs decreased the rates of pediatric emergency healthcare utilization for injuries and increased the rates of respiratory illnesses, asthma, heat-related illnesses, heatstroke, dehydration, infectious and parasitic diseases, lower respiratory infections, and enteritis.

{"text": "Allergic asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder driven by a T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated immune response that involves eosinophils and mast cell recruitment to affected tissues, eliciting inflammatory cytokines and IgE production. Typical symptoms in more severe cases include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, persistent coughing, excessive mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Current therapies, which focus on suppressing the immune system, mitigate the symptoms but are generally insufficient to address the disease. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) platform, initially developed as an attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), induces a potent T helper type 1 (Th1) polarized immune response, making it a promising candidate for treating Th2-dominant conditions, such as allergic asthma, ultimately alleviating the symptoms. BCG can be genetically modified to express antigens of other pathogens or immunogenic proteins, such as IL-12p70.

The main objective was to characterize this patient population, and the indications for prescribing biologics. The secondary goals were to assess these patients' clinical, endoscopic, and histologic finding, as well as patient tolerance, and to compare our cohort at baseline with pediatric patients from two European registers of EoE treated with conventional therapies. Thirty-six patients were prescribed 37 biologics (omalizumab, n = 1; mepolizumab, n = 6; dupilumab, n = 30). At diagnosis, the mean patient age was 7.4 (Â±4.4) years, and most patients had at least one atopic comorbidity (91.7%, n = 33). Failure of first-line treatments was the main reason for starting biological therapy (75.7%, n = 28), prescribed as compassionate use (54.1%, n = 20).

The exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status, and the outcome was first healthcare utilization for COPD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD. Of the 27,595,469 individuals, 93.9 % had received COVID-19 vaccination. The risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD was significantly lower in vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.46, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.46-0.47).

{"text": "The role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains controversial. This study aimed to delineate the subgroup-specific relationships between the two by exploring cumulative and threshold effects. 3,040 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline evidence of DKD were included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to investigate the potential relationship between HDL-C level and DKD risk. To address subgroup heterogeneity, sex-stratified restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to model nonlinear relationships. The optimal threshold was identified through the maximum selected statistics and validated via 1,000 bootstrap iterations. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, diabetes duration, and metabolic status were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves further validated these threshold effects. During a median follow-up of 3.13 years, 665 subjects (21.9%) progressed to DKD. Overall, each 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level independently reduced DKD risk by 43%. RCS analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between HDL-C and DKD risk (P for overall = 0.025, P for nonlinear = 0.317), with increased risk reduction at lower concentrations, plateauing at higher levels. A robust threshold of 0.93 mmol/L was identified, showing significantly stronger protection against DKD progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69, P < 0.001) compared to the traditional cutoff (HR = 0.86, P = 0.109).

Furthermore, research conducted to date has not consistently excluded women with chronic hypertension and/or kidney disease prior to pregnancy, indicating a possible selection bias. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of the updated literature on renal outcomes in women who were healthy prior to pregnancy and experienced pre-eclampsia.

{"text": "Right ventricular (RV) mechanics have critical roles in cardiovascular physiology, yet their assessment remains challenging owing to the right ventricle's complex geometry and unique interaction with the pulmonary vascular system. This review explores RV structural, functional, and physiologic considerations, emphasizing their interplay with pulmonary hypertension (PH), heart failure, and perioperative outcomes. Traditional pressure- and volume-centric methods of RV evaluation, including echocardiography and right heart catheterization, often fail to provide comprehensive, load-independent measures of RV function. The integration of these measures for pressure-volume (PV) loop analysis has emerged as a valuable tool, offering insights into RV contractility, compliance, and ventriculoarterial coupling. This review highlights advances in intraoperative and noninvasive PV loop methodologies, including echocardiography-derived techniques and integration with catheter-based pressure measurements. These approaches enable detailed assessment of RV function, enhancing prognostic capabilities in such conditions as PH, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and postsurgical interventions like left ventricular assist device implantation and valve replacement. Despite the potential of RV PV loop analysis, its clinical adoption has been limited by technical complexities, cost, and the need for specialized expertise. This underscores the importance of standardizing PV loop acquisition techniques and validating surrogate markers, such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/pulmonary artery systolic pressure ratio, to improve accessibility and utility. By providing a comprehensive overview of current and emerging methods for RV assessment, this review aims to foster a deeper understanding of RV mechanics, driving innovation in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies for cardiac surgeries.", "entities": [{"entity": "VASCULAR SYSTEM", "start": 215, "end": 229, "matched_text": "VASCULAR SYSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PULMONARY HYPERTENSION", "start": 345, "end": 366, "matched_text": "PULMONARY HYPERTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEART FAILURE", "start": 374, "end": 386, "matched_text": "HEART FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEART FAILURE", "start": 374, "end": 386, "matched_text": "HEART FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 521, "end": 525, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VALVE", "start": 1260, "end": 1264, "matched_text": "VALVE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PULMONARY ARTERY", "start": 1602, "end": 1617, "matched_text": "PULMONARY ARTERY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 1783, "end": 1786, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Patients presenting with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) often undergo percutaneous thrombectomy intending to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). However, the relationship between the extent of DVT and outcomes after thrombectomy has not been explored. The objective of this study was to compare rates of post-thrombectomy DVT recurrence between patients with isolated iliofemoral DVT and patients with iliofemoral DVT and extension more peripherally. We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT from 2014-2023. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: (1) iliofemoral DVT without popliteal/tibial extension or (2) iliofemoral DVT with popliteal/tibial extension. The primary outcome was acute DVT recurrence and multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk factors for recurrence. Chi-squared and t-tests were calculated for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare rates of acute DVT and chronic venous changes postoperatively. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 222 patients were identified during the study period (76 isolated iliofemoral DVT vs. 146 iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension) with a median follow-up of 19 months. Patients who presented with iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension were more likely to be older (57 vs. 50 years, p=0.004), have hypertension (64% vs. 41%, p=0.001) or hyperlipidemia (58% vs. 40%, p=0.01), and to have had surgery within the prior 6-months (29% vs. 17%, p=0.04). Amongst female patients, those on hormone therapy were more likely to have isolated iliofemoral DVT (17% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Patients with iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension had a greater chance of developing recurrent acute DVT (48% vs. 20%, p<0.001) and chronic venous changes (51% vs. 30%, p=0.004) during follow-up. Multivariable analysis showed a significant correlation between iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension (Odds ratio 3.8 [95% confidence interval 1.7-8.7], p=0.001) and acute DVT recurrence. There were no differences in the rates of reintervention or death. More extensive peripheral thrombus burden was associated with higher rates of follow-up DVT recurrence in patients undergoing thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT. These findings suggest that such patients may require closer follow-up and more aggressive anticoagulation therapy postoperatively. Moreover, our results provide a framework for further studies to specifically study the role peripheral thrombus may play in venous hemodynamics and the development of recurrent DVT and, ultimately, PTS.", "entities": [{"entity": "DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS", "start": 38, "end": 59, "matched_text": "DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "POST-THROMBOTIC SYNDROME", "start": 128, "end": 151, "matched_text": "POST-THROMBOTIC SYNDROME", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PTS", "start": 154, "end": 156, "matched_text": "PTS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 319, "end": 322, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHI", "start": 879, "end": 881, "matched_text": "CHI", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 1035, "end": 1041, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PERIPHERAL", "start": 1244, "end": 1253, "matched_text": "PERIPHERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 1436, "end": 1447, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 1436, "end": 1447, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HYPERLIPIDEMIA", "start": 1475, "end": 1488, "matched_text": "HYPERLIPIDEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RECURRENT", "start": 1800, "end": 1808, "matched_text": "RECURRENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 2550, "end": 2553, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection (SICAD) is a rare condition with an unclear natural history and no management consensus. This study evaluated mid-to-long-term outcomes of conservatively managed SICAD. This single-center, retrospective cohort study identified patients with SICAD from January 2011-December 2022 in the institutional electronic health record. Demographics, comorbidities, radiographic features, management, and outcomes were reviewed. Clinical endpoints were symptomatic remission, significant organ malperfusion, rupture, and secondary intervention. Radiographic endpoints included dissection remodeling (i.e., shortened dissection length or increased true lumen diameter), celiac aneurysm incidence, and aneurysm diameter growth among <1.5 cm, 1.5-1.9 cm, and â¥2.0 cm size categories. Endpoints were stratified by symptomatic vs. incidental presentation. Forty-nine patients with SICAD were identified. Eighty percent were male, and 57% had hypertension. Extra-celiac aneurysms were present in 25%, including 12% with aortic aneurysms. Forty-nine percent of SICADs were symptomatic on presentation, while 51% were incidentally discovered. Patients with incidental SICAD were older than symptomatic patients (62 Â± 15 years vs. 54 Â± 8 years, p=0.02) but had similar comorbidities. Ninety-two percent of symptomatic patients experienced complete symptom resolution without operative intervention by the earliest follow-up (182 Â± 386 days). No incidental cases developed symptoms over a mean of 3.9 Â± 3.5 years. No significant organ malperfusion, rupture, or secondary intervention occurred in this series. Symptomatic SICAD was more likely to undergo remodeling than incidental SICAD (p=0.02) over an average of 3.3 Â± 3.7 years. Thirty-two percent of symptomatic cases had partial remodeling, and 37% had no residual dissection. Seventy-one percent of incidental dissections remained stable without remodeling. Celiac thrombus on initial imaging predicted remodeling (p=0.003). Baseline antihypertensive (p=0.006) and antiplatelet use (p=0.047) were associated with remodeling in symptomatic patients only. Aneurysmal degeneration was noted in 46% of all presenting lesions; none were â¥2.0 cm in maximal diameter. Incidental cases presented with more aneurysmal dilatation than symptomatic cases (59% vs. 32%, p<0.001). No celiac aneurysms at presentation grew over an average of 4.8 Â± 4.0 years. Forty percent and 13% of incidental and symptomatic cases without initial celiac aneurysms, respectively, developed incident aneurysms by a mean follow-up of 2.0 Â± 3.0 years (p=0.3). Conservative management of uncomplicated SICAD yielded excellent clinical outcomes, even with incomplete remodeling and aneurysmal degeneration, which were common, albeit largely benign.

{"text": "Natural products play important roles as origins of new cardiovascular drugs. Xanthones are polyphenolic compounds that carry a dibenzo-Î³-pyrone skeleton and exhibit a broad range of pharmacological activities. The application of xanthones and their derivatives as drug leads has been an area of intense study due to a \"privileged structure\" of the xanthone skeleton. However, cardiovascular protective activity of simple hydroxylated xanthones, a subclass of xanthones characterized by the presence of one to four hydroxyl substituents, has never been discussed to date. This review aims to provide new insights into the cardiovascular protective effect of natural and synthetic hydroxylated xanthones with a focus on their structure-activity relationship. The activity of hydroxylated xanthones on cardiovascular disease risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes and others was also discussed. The results showed that the cardiovascular protective activity of hydroxylated xanthones is dependent on the number and position of hydroxyl substituents attached to the benzene ring skeleton. Hydroxyxanthones with a higher number of hydroxyl substituents or with a presence of -OH at the C-3 position of the skeleton were found to exhibit higher activity. Recent findings revealed that the configuration of hydroxyl side groups may also be important. Furthermore, 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7) could be a promising lead for novel anti-hypertensive drugs. In conclusion, the evidence which support the use of hydroxylated xanthones as leads for novel cardioprotective, anti-atherosclerotic and anti-diabetic drugs is generally lacking in the literature.

This condition can lead to substantial respiratory impairment, severely affecting patients' quality of life and functional capacity. In this context, targeted physiotherapy strategies, particularly diaphragmatic stretching, emerge as vital interventions that may enhance respiratory function and overall recovery. Understanding the role of these therapeutic approaches is essential for optimizing patient outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario. This case report details the rehabilitation of a 29-year-old female with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis who developed post-tuberculosis pleural effusion. A structured physiotherapy protocol was implemented over four weeks, comprising diaphragmatic stretching, aerobic conditioning, and resistance training. Outcomes were measured through objective assessments of respiratory performance, including chest expansion and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The patient exhibited marked improvements in respiratory parameters following the intervention, with a notable increase in chest expansion and PEFR. These enhancements suggest a positive impact of targeted physiotherapy on lung mechanics and overall respiratory efficiency. This case underscores the potential benefits of incorporating diaphragmatic stretching and complementary physiotherapy techniques into the management of post-tuberculosis pleural effusion.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between COVID-19 vaccination and COPD. We conducted a cohort study using COVID-19 immunization registry data. The exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status, and the outcome was first healthcare utilization for COPD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD. Of the 27,595,469 individuals, 93.9 % had received COVID-19 vaccination. The risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD was significantly lower in vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.46, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.46-0.47). The decreased risk was more evident for first emergency room visits or hospitalizations for COPD (HR = 0.24, 95 % CI = 0.24-0.25). In the subgroup analysis, the decreased risk of first healthcare utilization for COPD was less significant in participants with frequent healthcare utilization, including the elderly, women, medical aid recipients, and those with comorbidities, than their counterparts. Of these, the smaller magnitude of the inverse association was observed in the pulmonary tuberculosis and asthma group. Regarding vaccination subtypes, the reduction was more prominent among those with a single vaccination (HR = 0.27, 95 % CI = 0.26-0.29) and mRNA recipients (HR = 0.35, 95 % CI = 0.35-0.36).

This study systematically evaluated its anti-TB efficacy in vitro and in vivo. In vitro analyses encompassed antimicrobial susceptibility testing to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, 10 drug-susceptible clinical isolates, and 30 multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, alongside evaluations of minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) using H37Rv and seven clinical isolates. Additionally, intracellular anti-mycobacterial activity was assessed in H37Rv-infected macrophages, and cytotoxicity was profiled through MTT assays on Vero cells. In vivo studies utilized acute and chronic murine tuberculosis infection models to investigate the dose-dependent efficacy of NTB-3119M (50 and 100 mg/kg) against H37Rv, with concurrent comparative histopathological analysis of lung and spleen tissues. NTB-3119M demonstrated superior in vitro potency against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains compared to first-line agents, Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RIF), Moxifloxacin (MOFX), Levofloxacin (LVFX), and Streptomycin (SM), exhibiting comparable activity to PBTZ169. Time-kill curves for NTB-3119M indicate its potent bactericidal activity. Meanwhile, No cytotoxicity was observed on Vero cells. Spontaneous resistant mutants of NTB-3119M appears at a frequency of 6.44 Ã 10 Our research provided comprehensive evidence that NTB-3119M with increased water solubility and bioavailability based on previous research performed excellent anti-tuberculosis activity and less cytotoxicity, which effectively tackled the undesirable drug properties associated with previous benzothiopyrone derivatives.

{"text": "Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging pathogens of global concern, particularly in regions with declining tuberculosis rates. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, immune pathogenesis, and microbiome interactions underlying NTM infections. The rising incidence of NTM is driven by environmental factors, immunocompromised populations, and advanced diagnostics. Clinically, NTM manifests as pulmonary, lymphatic, skin/soft tissue, or disseminated disease, with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and M. abscessus being predominant pathogens. Host immunity, particularly Th1 responses mediated by IL-12/IFN-Î³ and TLR2 signaling, is critical for controlling NTM, while dysregulated immunity (e.g., elevated Th2 cytokines, PD-1/IL-10 pathways) exacerbates susceptibility. Emerging research highlights the gut-lung axis as a pivotal mediator of disease, where microbiome dysbiosis-marked by reduced Prevotella and Bifidobacterium-impairs systemic immunity and promotes NTM progression. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbial metabolites like inosine modulate macrophage and T-cell responses, offering therapeutic potential. Studies reveal distinct airway microbiome signatures in NTM patients, characterized by enriched Streptococcus and Prevotella, and reduced diversity linked to worse outcomes. Despite advances, treatment remains challenging due to biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and relapse rates. This review underscores the need for microbiome-targeted therapies, personalized medicine, and longitudinal studies to unravel causal relationships between microbial ecology and NTM pathogenesis.", "entities": [{"entity": "NTM", "start": 31, "end": 33, "matched_text": "NTM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUBERCULOSIS", "start": 117, "end": 128, "matched_text": "TUBERCULOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 169, "end": 176, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 206, "end": 217, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 457, "end": 462, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 481, "end": 487, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX (MAC)", "start": 495, "end": 527, "matched_text": "MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX (MAC)", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TH1", "start": 603, "end": 605, "matched_text": "TH1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-12", "start": 629, "end": 633, "matched_text": "IL-12", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TLR2", "start": 646, "end": 649, "matched_text": "TLR2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 651, "end": 659, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TH2", "start": 739, "end": 741, "matched_text": "TH2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PD-1", "start": 754, "end": 757, "matched_text": "PD-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-10", "start": 759, "end": 763, "matched_text": "IL-10", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-10", "start": 759, "end": 763, "matched_text": "IL-10", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 840, "end": 843, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MACROPHAGE", "start": 1096, "end": 1105, "matched_text": "MACROPHAGE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1113, "end": 1116, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1113, "end": 1116, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "STREPTOCOCCUS", "start": 1257, "end": 1269, "matched_text": "STREPTOCOCCUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BIOFILM FORMATION", "start": 1390, "end": 1406, "matched_text": "BIOFILM FORMATION", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and is the second leading cause of death from contagious diseases worldwide. Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with the highest burden of TB and TB/HIV co-infection. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB present significant challenges to TB care and control efforts, particularly multi-drug-resistant TB, which poses a serious public health issue in low-income countries such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of drug-resistant TB and its associated factors among TB patients in Dilla University Referral Hospital (DURH). A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from March-2024 to May-2024 among 216 pulmonary TB patients attending DURH. Gene Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Xpert MTB/XDR assay was used to assess the pattern of drug resistance in TB. The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay was used to detect rifampicin resistance, while the Xpert MTB/XDR assay was employed to identify isoniazid resistance and resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs when rifampicin resistance was detected. Data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. In this study, out of 216 confirmed MTB cases, 5 (2.3%) were identified as drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), with mono-resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid at 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in DR-TB prevalence between those with and without a history of anti-TB treatment (p = 0.001). Notably, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was more prevalent among individuals with diabetes mellitus and those with a history of previous treatment, showing p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively. Among the 216 confirmed TB cases, 5 cases of DR-TB were identified, accounting for 2.3%. DR-TB was more prevalent in patients with a history of anti-TB treatment, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced early detection and improved treatment monitoring. Additionally, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was notably prevalent in individuals with diabetes mellitus and prior treatment history, with p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively.

We conducted a multicentre, two-arm, open-label, equivalent, stratified block randomisation trial from 7 districts involving 4670 eligible new patients with TB in Shanghai, China. Patients in the intervention group were instructed to get access to the app through WeChat. In the control group, patients were treated with standard of care.

{"text": "Despite baseline investigation before the start of therapeutic management, patients being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis often suffer from liver injury due to the effects of anti-tuberculosis drugs, particularly isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF). However, there is no treatment against the hepatotoxic effect of INH and RIF. Therefore, it is better to focus on medicinal plants for the prevention of liver injury caused by these drugs. Cordia africana has been used traditionally as a treatment for liver related diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of aqueous extract of Cordia africana leaves against isoniazid and rifampicin-induced liver toxicity in mice. Cordia africana leaf powder was decocted in water and 30 Swiss albino mice 28.0 to 35.0 g were grouped into five groups: Group I mice were given 20 ml/kg distilled water and Group II mice were given 75mg/ kg INH and 150 mg /kg RIF body weight. Group III, group IV, and group V mice were given, 75 mg/kg INH plus 150 mg/kg RIF in addition to 200 mg/kg extract, 400 mg/kg extract, and 50 mg/kg silymarin respectively. The treatments lasted for 14 days. Blood samples were taken from each study subject for liver biochemical tests. In addition, livers were also taken for histopathological examination. Compared to Group I, Group II showed a significant increase (P<0.05) in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin. This elevation likely dictates the possibility of liver dysfunction or damage. Also, in the groups of mice that were treated with Cordia africana at a dose of 400 mg/kg and silymarin demonstrated that a marked decrease in ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin levels. This reduction indicates that both Cordia africana and silymarin might have a protective effect on liver function, especially when compared to Group II which they didn't receive such treatment. The liver index of Group IV mice showed a decrease significantly (P<0.05) compared to Group II. Besides histopathologic analysis showed that the plant extract at a higher dose did not show inflammation and showed negligible degeneration of hepatocytes and congestion in sinusoids, whereas in the negative control severe degeneration of hepatocytes and moderate inflammation were seen. From this experiment we found that the aqueous extract of Cordia africana has hepatoprotective effect against isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.

Bioinformatics analysis assessed FHL2 expression and survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR, and Western blotting (WB) were performed to assess FHL2 levels in LUSC tissue microarrays (TMA) and cell lines. In vitro, CCK-8, plate colony formation, wound healing, and Matrigel Transwell assays were conducted to investigate the effects of FHL2 on LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo, xenograft tumor models were utilized to evaluate the role of FHL2 in LUSC progression. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation (IP) and proximity ligation assays (PLA) were performed to explore the interaction between FHL2 and c-Jun. The cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was conducted to assess c-Jun stability in the context of FHL2 overexpression or knockdown. The influence of differential FHL2 expression on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway was analyzed via WB. Furthermore, xenograft tumor models, WB, and IHC were employed to determine whether FHL2 mediates LUSC resistance to afatinib. FHL2 expression was significantly upregulated in LUSC tissues, as demonstrated by the TCGA database analysis and validated through IHC staining of TMA. Moreover, elevated FHL2 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in LUSC patients. FHL2 overexpression enhanced LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro while accelerating xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, FHL2 knockdown exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, FHL2 interacts with c-Jun and suppresses its ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the c-Jun protein, upregulating PDK1 expression, and subsequently activating the PAM signaling pathway. Notably, FHL2 overexpression induced afatinib resistance in LUSC cells, and patients with afatinib resistance exhibited high levels of FHL2 expression.

We investigated the outcomes of this regimen in a real-world (RW) setting. This retrospective, international RW study included patients with stage I HER2+ eBC treated with the APT regimen (tumors of 5-20 mm, node-negative (N0 or Nmi) and no previous history of BC). Data on demographics, tumor characteristics, treatments, and survival were extracted from medical records from 11 hospitals in Belgium, Italy, and Brazil. The primary endpoint was 5-year RW disease-free survival (rwDFS), and secondary was RW overall survival (rwOS). From January 2014 to July 2018, 252 patients were identified. The median age was 57.9 years, and 69.8% were postmenopausal women at diagnosis. Most tumors (88.1%) had ductal histology and were estrogen receptor-positive (81.7%). The median tumor size was 12 mm (Interquartile [IQR] 9.0-15.0). Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 77.8%, and radiotherapy was administered in 76.1% of patients. Median follow-up was 5.8 years (IQR 5.0-6.8). In total, 13 events were observed: 4 locoregional, 2 distant (1 bone and 1 visceral) and 7 second nonbreast primary malignancies.

{"text": "Bisphenols are widely found in plastic products and may be hazardous to human health due to their estrogenic effects. Bisphenols may be involved in the carcinogenic process through endocrine-disrupting properties, especially in breast cancer. However, the specific targets and mechanisms of bisphenols remain unclear. By integrating network toxicology, transcriptomics, and molecular docking technology, this study aims to methodically identify the possible targets and mechanisms of five bisphenols in causing breast cancer. Targets linked to breast cancer were screened using the disease database, and bisphenols targets were screened using the compound and its prediction database. Ultimately, 424 targets associated with bisphenols and breast cancer were selected. With the STRING database, Cytoscape, and enrichment analysis, 12 core targets were identified, which are predominantly engaged in chemical carcinogenesis - receptor activation and estrogen signaling pathway. Furthermore, 26 common differentially expressed genes, including the core target PGR, were found by transcriptomic analysis in human breast cancer cells exposed to four bisphenols. Molecular docking showed that the PGR protein and five bisphenols had the lowest binding energy (-7.7 â¼ -7.0 kcal/mol) and the highest binding affinity. This study suggests that bisphenols may bind to PGR and induce its expression, thus contributing to breast carcinogenesis. This may happen via chemical cancer-receptor activation, estrogen signaling pathway, and endocrine resistance pathway.

We found that plant proteins, animal proteins, milk proteins, and microbial proteins are all ideal sources for producing peptides with high anti-CRC activity. Several peptides isolated from these proteins can promote apoptosis, inhibit metastasis, reduce invasion of CRC, and finally suppress tumor growth. Notably, low-molecular-weight FDBPs, particularly those below 1kDa and rich in Asp, Gln, Lys, Gly, and Ser, exhibit better stability and stronger anti-CRC efficacy. The anti-CRC activity of FDBPs is associated with balancing the gut microbiota, activating the p38 MAPK pathway, and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; however, the upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, we discovered that nanoparticle and glycopeptide modifications can enhance the activity and stability of anti-CRC peptides, enabling more precise delivery to cancer sites.

{"text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent and deadly disease that is largely refractory to immunotherapy. The only CRC subset that responds to these therapies is characterized by prevalent microsatellite instability (MSI), extensive CD8+ T cell infiltration and high expression of innate immune signaling pathways. Endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING pathway is essential for this CD8+ T cell antitumor response in MSI CRCs, suggesting that activating it in other CRCs could boost immunotherapy response rates. In contrast, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is typically associated with tumor-promoting inflammation although this has primarily been studied in immune cells. We used a mixture of flow cytometry, activation assays, in vivo orthotopic models and patient-derived organoids to investigate the effect of NLRP3 activation in CRC cells on cGAS/STING-mediated antitumor immunity. Our results show that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome specifically in CRC cells boosts cGAS/STING signaling in both MSI and non-MSI CRCs and that dual stimulation increases CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. The ability of NLRP3 to enhance cGAS/STING signaling was specific and did not occur with activation of other innate immune pathways such as AIM2 or TLRs. Enhancement of cGAS/STING signaling by NLRP3 proceeded via a positive feedback loop that was inflammasome-independent and required early crosstalk between the signaling mediators and regulation of their gene expression.

We demonstrated that thymol significantly inhibited the proliferation, viability, and induced apoptosis of HCT116 and CT26 cells. And, thymol suppressed the secretion of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, thymol promoted cell damage mediated by increased mitochondrial membrane potential in both two cells. In addition, thymol triggered the energy metabolism inhibition induced by calcium overload in HCT116 and CT26 cells.

In this study, we showed that DICER1 was highly expressed in TAMs and closely associated with M2 polarization in CRLM. Knockdown of Dicer, encoded by DICER1 in humans (or Dicer1 in mice), skewed macrophages toward an anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumor cell phagocytosis, thereby suppressing tumor growth in mice. An M2 macrophage-targeting nanosystem was developed to deliver Dicer1 siRNA for selectively downregulating Dicer expression in M2 macrophages. In situ manipulation of TAMs with the nanoparticle exerted a significant anti-tumor effect with an improved immune microenvironment in a CRLM mouse model. Macrophage depletion experiments further suggested that this effect was largely dependent on the presence of TAMs. Mechanistically, Dicer inhibition reprogrammed M2-like macrophages through downregulation of miR-148a-3p and miR-1981-5p.

Here we show that more morning naps are linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer's dementia, whereas more early afternoon naps are linked to reduced amyloid Î² levels. Higher intraindividual variability of nap duration is shown to be associated with increased amyloid Î² and neurofibrillary tangles. Our findings suggest that specific timing patterns and irregularities in daytime napping are linked to Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology. Multi-dimensional assessments of nap behaviors may aid in risk stratification for neurocognitive impairment and offer a potential target for interventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging. Research suggests that too much daytime napping is associated with adverse brain health in older adults. However, how the timing and regularity of daytime naps link to cognitive health remain unclear. We followed over 1000 older adults for up to 17 years and used wrist-worn watches to measure their nap patterns. We found that more frequent morning naps were linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimerâs dementia. Additionally, more naps in the early afternoon and more consistent nap patterns were linked to lower levels of Alzheimerâs pathology. These findings suggest that when and how people nap during the day may help inform the risk of developing dementia.", "entities": [{"entity": "NEURODEGENERATION", "start": 52, "end": 68, "matched_text": "NEURODEGENERATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NAP", "start": 121, "end": 123, "matched_text": "NAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FREQUENCY", "start": 138, "end": 146, "matched_text": "FREQUENCY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SLEEP", "start": 206, "end": 210, "matched_text": "SLEEP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GAP", "start": 349, "end": 351, "matched_text": "GAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEMENTIA", "start": 483, "end": 490, "matched_text": "DEMENTIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DEMENTIA", "start": 483, "end": 490, "matched_text": "DEMENTIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "start": 496, "end": 514, "matched_text": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RUSH", "start": 604, "end": 607, "matched_text": "RUSH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MEMORY", "start": 609, "end": 614, "matched_text": "MEMORY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES", "start": 1073, "end": 1095, "matched_text": "NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AID", "start": 1602, "end": 1604, "matched_text": "AID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 1825, "end": 1829, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 1864, "end": 1866, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FREQUENT", "start": 2083, "end": 2090, "matched_text": "FREQUENT", "type": "symptom"}]}

Disease-modifying treatments that can slow disease progression are now becoming available for patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, including those with mild cognitive impairment. However, challenges in diagnosis and assessment for these patients remain. This study characterized the care pathway for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia, including barriers to care, and considered the future treatment landscape, with the aim of making recommendations for optimizing the care pathway in readiness for the availability of new disease-modifying treatments. Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted with physicians in general/tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Physicians from mainland China and Japan were not included. Physicians managing patients with mild cognitive impairment. Number and/or proportion of participants providing a given response, and numerical estimates provided by interview participants. Forty-four physicians, primarily neurologists (n = 31; 70.5 %), were interviewed. Participants managed a median of 67.5 patients with mild cognitive impairment per month, of whom 24.0-87.5 % had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Clinical investigations routinely comprised brief neuropsychological assessments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (n = 41), as well as neurological tests (n = 39) and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 40). Except in Korea, comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries and amyloid positron emission tomography were seldom conducted in Asia. Most patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease were treated with nootropics and/or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Korea, 96 %; all other regions, 69 %), and almost all were recommended a non-pharmacological treatment (Korea, 93 %; all other regions, 100 %). Detection of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease was considered prompt in Korea but suboptimal in other regions (n = 16) owing to low disease awareness among patients. Barriers to assessment and diagnosis included delayed healthcare visits for initial assessment (n = 7), neuroimaging backlogs (n = 6), and insufficient neuropsychology resources (n = 13). Access to amyloid biomarker tests, including amyloid positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and blood tests, was limited in regions other than Korea. The survey findings showed that screening and diagnostic processes for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia require further optimization. Efforts should also be made to educate patients and caregivers, improve the diagnostic capabilities of primary and secondary healthcare providers, and reinforce cognitive screening services.

{"text": "Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles originating from endocytic processes, have garnered increasing attention due to their roles in both physiological functions and pathological conditions. Initially identified in the 1980 s, exosomes are formed within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through the invagination of the endosomal membrane, leading to the creation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). These ILVs can either be degraded by lysosomes or released into the extracellular space as exosomes, facilitating intercellular communication. In the nervous system, exosomes are implicated in various functions, including neural development and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This study presents a novel protocol for the isolation and proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from the substantia nigra (SN) of rat brains. By employing a combination of differential centrifugation and immunocapture techniques, we achieved a purer exosome fraction and higher exosome yield compared to traditional ultracentrifugation methods. Our proteomics analysis identified 51, 48, and 70 proteins from three distinct exosome samples (SN-EV-1, SN-EV-2, and SN-EV-4), with Gene Ontology annotation revealing their involvement in diverse biological functions. This research not only establishes a reliable method for isolating brain-derived exosomes but also sets the stage for comparative studies between healthy and neurodegenerative conditions.

The accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as misfolded superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1), contributes significantly to neuronal degeneration in ALS. Therapies targeting misfolded proteins represent a promising strategy. Baicalein, a flavonoid compound with neuroprotective properties, has shown efficacy in clearing misfolded proteins and improving behaviors in rodent models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, its effects in ALS remain largely unexplored. This study demonstrated that baicalein treatment reduced total and misfolded SOD1 protein levels in both soluble and insoluble fractions of a motor neuron cell line overexpressing mutant SOD1. Baicalein also reduced intracellular SOD1 aggregates in cultured motor neurons transfected with SOD1/G93A, preserving neurite length. In an ALS mouse model expressing the SOD1/G93A transgene, baicalein treatment decreased mSOD1 aggregation, increased spinal motor neuron density, and reduced neuromuscular junction denervation. Furthermore, baicalein partially improved motor behaviors, as assessed by the rotarod test.

To assess IL-35 (P35 and Ebi3 subunits) and IL-37 gene expression, along with the serum levels of IL-35 protein in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. Cytokine gene expression was measured using the qRT-PCR technique, while IL-35 serum levels were measured using the ELISA method. The data obtained were analyzed using a Bayesian regression model in the R software. The results revealed that the expression of P35 gene, of the two subunits of IL-35, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, Ebi3 and IL-37 transcript levels were significantly lower in patients compared to healthy individuals (p<0.001). In contrast, IL-35 serum level in patients showed a significant increase compared to the control group (p=0.016). Notably, IL-37 expression showed a negative correlation with age (p=0.004). . We also observed positive and significant correlations between the gene expression of P35 and Ebi3 (p= 0.02, r= 0.4), P35 and IL-37 (p= 0.008, r= 0.45), and Ebi3 and IL-37 (p= 0.016, r= 0.41). In conclusion, our study revealed a higher serum protein level of IL-35 in PD patients compared to the healthy control group.

Six electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, AGELINE) were searched by two independent authors. Clinical trials published before April 2024 that reported the effect of chronic exercise on EF in individuals with PD were included. Of 608 identified studies, 18 studies met eligibility criteria.

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated Î±-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that Î±-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, Î±-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach.

Apart from liver disease arising from hepatitis C viral infection, most chronic liver diseases currently have no cure. Several therapeutic alternatives, including some natural products, have been proposed to treat liver diseases. The natural product Jatropha dioica has been reported to possess antioxidant activity and, by extension, could have hepatoprotective activity. Accordingly, our aim was to test the hypothesis that an extract of J. dioica is protective against liver damage induced by valproic acid (VPA). Twelve male and twelve female Wistar rats were sorted into four groups: control, non-toxicity, valproic acid control (VPA-C), and J. dioica + VPA (JdVPA). J. dioica (300 mg/kg, given orally) was used as treatment, followed by a concomitant injection of VPA (500 mg/kg, i.p.) for the first 4 days to induce liver injury. To evaluate the severity of the injury, liver function tests were performed. In addition, oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified, as well as measures of the expression of the genes Actb, Il6, and Nfkb1. The VPA-C group showed a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malondialdehyde (MDA), a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a reduction in glutathione (GSH) vs the control group. The JdVPA group showed a significant decrease in ALT, AST, and MDA and an increase in GSH and SOD vs the VPA-C group.

{"text": "Hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) patients possess adverse lipid homeostatic alterations, subsequently affecting their treatment regimens and prognoses. However, the precise association between one lipid homeostasis indicator, remnant cholesterol (RC), and HBV-ACLF prognoses have not been fully elucidated. In this retrospective study, the relationship between RC with 28- and 90-day HBV-ACLF prognoses was delineated. 595 HBV-ACLF patients were recruited, and data collected for laboratory parameters at admission, as well as whether poor 28- and 90-day prognoses occurred during the follow-up period, in the form of mortality, or liver transplantation. Patients were divided into 3 groups, based on RC tertiles (Q1-3), and 4 multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify the associations between RC levels and ACLF prognoses; these analyses excluded different confounding factors, based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Stratified analysis was conducted to investigate the association between RC and ACLF risk among different subgroups, based on age, sex as well as complications and artificial liver treatment. RC accuracy versus that of other lipid indicators to predict 28- and 90-day ACLF survival was evaluated by restricted cubic spline and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, while Kaplan-Meier curves measured cumulative 28- and 90-day mortality risks. For all 4 regression models, higher RC were associated with worse liver function, coagulation, and HBV-ACLF prognoses. Restricted cubic spline analysis identified a non-linear relationship between RC and HBV-ACLF prognoses, in which the Q3 RC tertile had the lowest 28-day and 90-day HBV-ACLF survival rates; this was further confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, subgroup analysis found that higher RC correlated to worse ACLF prognoses among hypoproteinemia patients. Moreover, RC, compared to total cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as non-high density lipoprotein, was the most accurate in predicting poor 28- and 90-day ACLF prognoses. Elevated RC was significantly associated with poorer 28- and 90-day HBV-ACLF prognoses, even after accounting for all other traditional risk factors. Therefore, monitoring RC, along with interventions to reduce their levels, could aid in improving ACLF patient outcomes.", "entities": [{"entity": "HEPATITIS B", "start": 1, "end": 11, "matched_text": "HEPATITIS B", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE", "start": 30, "end": 50, "matched_text": "CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LIPID", "start": 88, "end": 92, "matched_text": "LIPID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIPID HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 227, "end": 243, "matched_text": "LIPID HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHOLESTEROL", "start": 264, "end": 274, "matched_text": "CHOLESTEROL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 662, "end": 666, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 1155, "end": 1157, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "COAGULATION", "start": 1567, "end": 1577, "matched_text": "COAGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HYPOPROTEINEMIA", "start": 1941, "end": 1955, "matched_text": "HYPOPROTEINEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN", "start": 2037, "end": 2059, "matched_text": "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AID", "start": 2418, "end": 2420, "matched_text": "AID", "type": "protein"}]}

Four groups were created according to the presence of HBV and/or GDM as follows: a non-HBVC & GDM group (n = 5,323), a HBVC group (n = 5,508), a GDM group (n = 919) and a HBVC & GDM group (n = 1,065). Univariate analysis was carried out with the Mann-Whitney U test or the chi-squared test; P < 0.05 was used as the screening criterion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to investigate the effects of each of the relevant confounders on HBVC, GDM and HBVC & GDM. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant.

This study aims to explore the expression patterns and potential sources of residual viral nucleic acids following siRNA treatment in both in vitro and in vivo models, enhancing the understanding of siRNA's antiviral effects. Biochemical methods, combined with immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques, were employed to analyze the antiviral effects of siRNAs targeting the S, X, and C coding regions of HBV at the single-cell level in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cell model and rAAV8-HBV1.3 mouse model. The results indicate that, in both the in vitro and in vivo models, a single dose of siRNA treatment did not significantly reduce the proportion of cells positive for any HBV marker. Residual viral antigen and nucleic acid signals were broadly distributed across individual cells. The antiviral effects of siRNA generally exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of HBV, but vary across different viral markers, potentially due to factors such as target region, engagement, and the viral expression patterns within cells, with a potential inhibition plateau for core particle DNA. Furthermore, the combination of siRNA and the HBV core inhibitor GLS4 further reduced intracellular viral DNA in primary human hepatocytes.

{"text": "BackgroundThis study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) for chronic hepatitis B treatment from a payer's perspective in a limited-income context like Vietnam.MethodsA Markov model was developed to estimate the lifetime cost and effectiveness (measured in quality-adjusted life year, QALY) of TAF compared to TDF in the HbeAg+ patient population. Efficacy data came from clinical trials, and costs were based on 2023 data from an exit survey of 94 inpatients and 464 outpatients in Bach Mai hospital. Other clinical data were also sourced from CHB patients at Bach Mai hospital. Along with deterministic analysis, two-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, threshold, and budget impact analysis were performed.ResultsCompared to TDF, TAF yielded an additional cost of USD 3,983 and an additional QALY gained of 0.14, resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 32,090 per QALY gained. The ICER exceeds the cost-effective threshold of three-time gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, that is, USD 11,348, by 2.8 times. According to one-way sensitivity analysis, ICERs were driven mainly by transition probabilities and TDF/ TAF prices. TAF would be cost-effective compared to TDF at the three-time GDP per capital threshold if TAF price were reduced by 33.4%.ConclusionsTAF is not cost-effective compared to TDF for treating chronic hepatitis B in HBeAg+ patients.

{"text": "The tumor microenvironment has an important role in the growth and progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Immune checkpoint molecules, including PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4, are crucial to regulate the T cells function in the tumor microenvironment. Exploring the expression of these molecules in DLBCL microenvironment is crucial for developing targeted therapies enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. This study aims to evaluate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4 in DLBCL, assess the relation of their expression to different clinicopathological parameters and evaluate their prognostic significance. This retrospective study encompassed 103 cases diagnosed as de novo DLBCL. Clinicopathologic and survival data were gathered. IHC for PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4 was performed. PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4 positive reaction was observed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 68.9% (71/103), 82.5% (85/103), and 92.2% (95/103) of DLBCL cases, respectively. PD1 expression in TILs was significantly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity and prolonged overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis. LAG3 expression in TILs was significantly associated with IPI score and tended towards shorter OS (not statistically significant). LAG3 expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS). CTLA4 expression in TILs was significantly associated with advanced disease stage (III/IV). PD1 and LAG3 are expressed mainly in TILs. PD1 expression (in TILs and tumor cells) is associated with prolonged OS, while LAG3 expression (in tumor cells) is associated with shorter DFS and its expression in TILs tended towards shorter OS.

This study used a three-group quasi-experimental design in which 75 older patients with knee osteoarthritis were selected purposefully. Physical function, stiffness, and pain intensity were assessed via WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index). Pain intensity was also assessed by the visual analogue scale. The range of motion the before and after the operation was recorded as well. Ghee was applied to the painful areas in the intervention group. The placebo group received Vaseline, whereas the control group received only a 1-min normal massage. There was a significant difference in the WOMAC pain scores between the intervention and placebo groups before and after the intervention, and both sheep ghee and Vaseline reduced pain, with the sheep ghee group showing greater pain reduction than the Vaseline group.

Post-intervention, the controlled group showed better physical function, while the resistive group showed less center of pressure posterolateral displacement (p = 0.031). Additionally, resistive and aerobic groups demonstrated less pain intensity, greater muscle strength, and better physical function.

However, the association between these risk factors and CTS under conditions of cumulative exposure to the risk factors remains unclear. In this study, we utilized a cumulative risk score to assess the prevalence level of CTS , and further evaluated the interactions between different risk factors and their cumulative association with CTS. Specifically, we first conducted a univariate regression analysis to evaluate the independent association of risk factors with CTS. Then we ran the multivariate regression model to filter out significant risk factors from risk factors associated with CTS. Next, we constructed the risk score to represent the cumulative association of significant risk factors with CTS, and we analyzed the relationship between the risk score and the prevalence level of CTS. The experiment results demonstrated that among the various personal factors, sex, age, BMI, sleep disorder, smoking frequency, restlessness, diabetes, kidney failure, arthritis, and joint pain were the most significant factors related to CTS. There existed the cumulative association of risk factors with CTS, and the cumulative association of risk factors was positively related with an increased prevalence level of CTS. Moreover, there existed a critical threshold (risk score = 3) for the increase in the prevalence level of CTS. Our study reveals the significant risk factors among personal factors related with CTS, and presents the cumulative association of these risk factors with CTS. Moreover, we offer the actionable suggestions for CTS prevention based on the experiment results. The occurrence of CTS is associated with various risk factors.

{"text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an extremely complex chronic whole joint disease. The regulation of NRF2 in cellular ferroptosis is involved in OA development; however, its upstream regulatory mechanism is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate the expression of downstream target genes through endogenous competition with micro RNAs. LncRNA ZEB1-AS1 regulates the expression of miR-365a-3p, which in turn negatively regulates NRF2 expression. Both lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 and NRF2 can bind to miR-365a-3p at the same target site. However, it remains unclear whether ZEB1-AS1 could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to reduce miR-365a-3p-mediated inhibition of NRF2. Specifically, the potential mechanism whereby ZEB1-AS1 might sequester miR-365a-3p through competitive binding, thereby alleviating its suppressive effect on NRF2 expression, requires further experimental validation. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate whether lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 could participate in the regulation of NRF2 expression through endogenous competition for binding to miR-365a-3p, as well as the role and mechanism in osteoarthritic cellular ferroptosis. Our findings demonstrated that NRF2 knockdown combined with miR-365a-3p overexpression significantly enhanced cellular ferroptosis and accelerated osteoarthritis progression. Conversely, both miR-365a-3p inhibition and ZEB1-AS1 overexpression were found to upregulate NRF2 expression, thereby mitigating cellular ferroptosis and OA development. Notably, ZEB1-AS1 overexpression exerted dual protective effects in chondrocytes by elevating NRF2 levels, effectively suppressing both ferroptosis and inflammatory damage. Mechanistically, we identified that the lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 modulates OA pathogenesis through the miR-365a-3p/NRF2 axis, suggesting this pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in OA progression.", "entities": [{"entity": "OSTEOARTHRITIS", "start": 1, "end": 14, "matched_text": "OSTEOARTHRITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OSTEOARTHRITIS", "start": 1, "end": 14, "matched_text": "OSTEOARTHRITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 45, "end": 51, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "JOINT DISEASE", "start": 59, "end": 71, "matched_text": "JOINT DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 78, "end": 87, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NRF2", "start": 92, "end": 95, "matched_text": "NRF2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FERROPTOSIS", "start": 109, "end": 119, "matched_text": "FERROPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ZEB1", "start": 343, "end": 346, "matched_text": "ZEB1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AS1", "start": 348, "end": 350, "matched_text": "AS1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MIR", "start": 380, "end": 382, "matched_text": "MIR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ACT", "start": 575, "end": 577, "matched_text": "ACT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 605, "end": 607, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 605, "end": 607, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 771, "end": 777, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1080, "end": 1083, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1649, "end": 1654, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 1726, "end": 1737, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises a heterogeneous group of rheumatic diseases characterized by axial and peripheral joint involvement, as well as extra-articular manifestations, including uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Although renal involvement in SpA is less understood, evidence suggests it may result from disease activity, chronic inflammation, or therapeutic agents. The underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. This systematic review evaluates the prevalence and risk factors associated with renal abnormalities in SpA. A systematic literature search was conducted following the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data from 26 studies published between 1980 and 2025 were synthesized. Extracted variables included study author, year and location of publication, sample size, renal assessment parameters, prevalence of renal involvement, presence of control groups, and statistical significance of findings. Renal involvement in SpA, assessed through hematuria, proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and International Classification of Diseases codes, showed considerable variability, with prevalence ranging from 0.2 to 77.5%. Nephrolithiasis was also more common among SpA patients, with reported rates between 1.6% and 29.1%. Potential risk factors, including age, disease activity, comorbidities, and HLA-B27 status, were explored, though findings remained inconsistent.

{"text": "Globally, there is an increasing trend of obesity in pregnant women, and Sub-Saharan Africa is not an exception. Recently, hemoglobin and anemia have received more attention as predictors of maternal obesity. No such study exists in Rwanda. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the factors associated with obesity, including hemoglobin and anemia, among pregnant women in Kigali, Rwanda. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals in Kigali, Rwanda, from June to August 2024. A questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data. Weight, height, and hemoglobin were measured using standard procedures. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed. A total of 445 pregnant women were recruited. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age and parity were 30.0 (26.0â35.0) years and 1 (0â3), respectively. Of the 445 women, 143 (32.1%), 249 (56.0%), and 53 (11.9%) were of normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. One hundred and seven (24.0%) pregnant women had anemia. In multivariate multinomial regression, no significant association was found between age, parity, residency, education, maternal occupation, hemoglobin level, anemia, and overweight status. Being from rural areas (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16â5.56) and being a housewife (AOR = 4.34, 95% 1.42â13.26) were significantly associated with obesity. While an increase in hemoglobin level was associated with obesity (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.02â1.60), anemia was inversely negatively associated with obesity (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.12â0.93). This study indicates that 12% of the pregnant women in Rwanda were obese. Hemoglobin and anemia are associated with maternal obesity in Rwanda. There is a need for more efforts in nutritional programs targeting pregnant women to combat maternal obesity in Rwanda.

{"text": "Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a well-established treatment for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF). While studies have demonstrated benefits for mortality, hospitalization rates, and health related quality of life (HRQL), evidence is particularly sparse regarding HRQL determinants in the older population. In a prospective, monocentric observational study, HRQL was assessed using the established Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI). The study was prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on 17 June 2015 under the registration number DRKS00008759. Patients were categorized into two age-based groups: older patients (â¥ 65 years) and younger patients (< 65 years). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze factors on HRQL, including SRI scores, anemia, autonomy impairment, exacerbation history and other factors. 237 Patients with COPD with CHRF receiving NIV therapy were included. The mean SRI summary score was 49.9 Â± 16.8. with 23.2% (N = 55) suffering from anemia and 36.7% (N = 87) experiencing â¥ 2 exacerbations annually. Autonomy impairment was observed in 49.4% (N = 117) of patients. The updated Charlson Comorbidity Index (uCCI) was 2.2 Â± 1.86. No significant differences were found in SRI Summary Scale scores between age groups (p = 0.581), but notable disparities were present in the uCCI (p = 0.014). Multiple regression analysis revealed a negative association of exacerbation history (Young group: -9.2; 95% CI = -14.8/ -3.55 vs. Older group: -6.17; 95% CI = -11.91/ -0.43) and level of autonomy impairment (e.g. Level of Care 2 Young group: -13.91; 95% CI = -21.4/ -6.43 vs. Older group: -14.94; 95% CI = -22.64/ -7.24) on SRI scores with age-related differences. Anemia only had a negative association on the SRI scores in younger patients with COPD (Young group: -7.9; 95% CI = -14.0/ -1.75 vs. Older group: -1.78; 95% CI = -9.21/ 5.65). Frequent exacerbations and a higher level of autonomy impairment had a negative association on HRQL across all ages. However only higher levels of impairment (â¥ 2) have a detrimental impact on older patients. Anemia was a negative HRQL factor in younger patients, where it was more prevalent. Overall, HRQL was found to be comparably favorable in both older and younger patients, despite age-specific differences in influencing factors.

Intestinal wall inflammation with villi atrophy results in malabsorption of nutrients and leads to several gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. High serum levels of anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies can be revealed in patients with CD. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 complement deposits in the oral mucosa and its condition in CD patients. Thirty CD patients underwent complete clinical examination followed by mycologic evaluation, of whom 10 additionally had oral mucosa biopsy. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was performed on the oral mucosa specimens using polyclonal rabbit IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 antibodies. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common complaints included pain due to oral ulcers, xerostomia, and gingival bleeding. Frequently observed comorbidities were anemia, allergy, and thyroid disorders. Common oral mucosal findings included white-coated tongue, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis. Candidiasis was revealed in 13 subjects (43.3%). IgA, IgG, IgM, or C3 deposits in the oral mucosa specimens were shown in none of the patients.

{"text": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options and poor survival outcomes. Lurbinectedin has been approved for the post-platinum setting, but there is a lack of real-world evidence and information related to its optimal sequencing and effectiveness across different lines of therapy. This study aimed to analyze line-dependent outcomes and response patterns of lurbinectedin in SCLC patients. In this retrospective multi-center study analysis, we enrolled SCLC patients treated with lurbinectedin between January 2020 and December 2024. Patient demographics, treatment histories, and outcomes were collected from electronic medical records. Response assessment was performed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment duration were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology, with specific attention to outcomes across different lines of therapy. A total of 64 patients were enrolled, with 59 evaluable for analysis (36 males [56.3 %], median age 65 years [range 37-81]). Lurbinectedin was given as second-line therapy in 39 patients (66.1 %) and as third-line or beyond in 20 patients (33.9 %). The overall response rate (ORR) was 37.3 % (n = 22), including 1 complete response (1.7 %) and 21 partial responses (35.6 %). By line of therapy, the ORR was 38.5 % (n = 15) in second-line and 35.0 % (n = 7) in third-line or later. The median overall survival (mOS) for all evaluable patients was 7.7 months, and the median duration of treatment (mDoT) was 4.3 months. At data cutoff, 13 patients (22 %) were alive and censored in the OS analysis, with a median follow-up of 8.5 months among survivors. Prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO) exposure was documented in 71.9 % of patients (n = 46); although those with prior IO had numerically longer mOS (8.8 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.06) and mDoT (4.6 vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.14), neither difference reached statistical significance. This survival analysis included 43 patients in the prior-IO group (3 patients with prior IO were excluded due to incomplete follow-up) and 16 patients in the no-IO group. The presence of baseline brain metastases (47 %) did not preclude clinical benefit. Treatment was generally well tolerated: the most common hematologic toxicities observed were anemia (44.1 %), thrombocytopenia (37.3 %), and neutropenia (15.3 %), predominantly grade 1-2, and no grade 4 adverse events were observed. Lurbinectedin demonstrated meaningful clinical activity in second-line therapy for SCLC, while also showing durable responses in heavily pretreated cases. These findings support the consideration of lurbinectedin also beyond second-line therapy in selected SCLC patients, though larger prospective studies are needed to validate these response patterns.", "entities": [{"entity": "SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 22, "matched_text": "SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 162, "end": 165, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LACK", "start": 200, "end": 203, "matched_text": "LACK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 219, "end": 226, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MOS", "start": 1445, "end": 1447, "matched_text": "MOS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 2159, "end": 2163, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 2183, "end": 2185, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ANEMIA", "start": 2311, "end": 2316, "matched_text": "ANEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ANEMIA", "start": 2311, "end": 2316, "matched_text": "ANEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "THROMBOCYTOPENIA", "start": 2328, "end": 2343, "matched_text": "THROMBOCYTOPENIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "THROMBOCYTOPENIA", "start": 2328, "end": 2343, "matched_text": "THROMBOCYTOPENIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NEUTROPENIA", "start": 2359, "end": 2369, "matched_text": "NEUTROPENIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NEUTROPENIA", "start": 2359, "end": 2369, "matched_text": "NEUTROPENIA", "type": "disease"}]}

CD8+ T cells were further co-cultured with K562, and the apoptosis rate of K562 was detected. The TLR4 in the bone marrow macrophages of patients with untreated SAA were significantly higher than those in the remission and control groups, and were negatively correlated with clinical indicators. RNA sequencing of macrophages with TLR4 knockdown showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in the innate immune and inflammatory chemotaxis signaling pathways. After TLR4 knockout or TLR4 inhibitor addition in bone marrow macrophages of patients with untreated SAA, the mRNA and protein expression levels of pyroptosis markers interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-18, NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin D were significantly lower than those in the control group. When CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with TLR4-knocked-down or inhibitor-added macrophages, the expression of perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced, and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity decreased. Inhibition of macrophage TLR4 expression in SAA patients could alleviate the over-activated cellular immune response in SAA patients by decreasing the level of pyroptosis.", "entities": [{"entity": "APLASTIC ANEMIA", "start": 8, "end": 22, "matched_text": "APLASTIC ANEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "APLASTIC ANEMIA", "start": 8, "end": 22, "matched_text": "APLASTIC ANEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SAA", "start": 25, "end": 27, "matched_text": "SAA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BONE MARROW FAILURE", "start": 90, "end": 108, "matched_text": "BONE MARROW FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 151, "end": 154, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4", "start": 159, "end": 178, "matched_text": "TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TLR4", "start": 181, "end": 184, "matched_text": "TLR4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MACROPHAGE", "start": 251, "end": 260, "matched_text": "MACROPHAGE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 302, "end": 322, "matched_text": "REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PYROPTOSIS", "start": 467, "end": 476, "matched_text": "PYROPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IL-1", "start": 479, "end": 482, "matched_text": "IL-1", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IL-18", "start": 487, "end": 491, "matched_text": "IL-18", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-18", "start": 487, "end": 491, "matched_text": "IL-18", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NLRP3", "start": 494, "end": 498, "matched_text": "NLRP3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CASPASE-1", "start": 501, "end": 509, "matched_text": "CASPASE-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 557, "end": 559, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 557, "end": 559, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GRANZYME B", "start": 723, "end": 732, "matched_text": "GRANZYME B", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 851, "end": 859, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BONE MARROW", "start": 904, "end": 914, "matched_text": "BONE MARROW", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHEMOTAXIS", "start": 1235, "end": 1244, "matched_text": "CHEMOTAXIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1246, "end": 1254, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1385, "end": 1391, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1385, "end": 1391, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "T CELL", "start": 1738, "end": 1743, "matched_text": "T CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSE", "start": 1861, "end": 1884, "matched_text": "CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSE", "type": "gene"}]}

This study aims to report the identification of biallelic inactivating CPOX variants in three unrelated patients with PAI and their clinical characteristics. We reported three patients with childhood-onset PAI, including two patients with 46,XY DSD. All three had adrenal hypoplasia. Additionally, they commonly had severe neonatal jaundice; two of them developed skin blisters in the areas exposed to phototherapy, and two showed severe neonatal anemia requiring transfusions. Exome sequencing was performed to explore the genetic basis of the patients. The pathogenicity of the identified variants was confirmed with targeted mRNA and proteomic analyses of the patient-derived peripheral blood cells. We identified biallelic rare CPOX variants in each patient, including c.2T>G, p.Arg426*, c.1277G>A and p.Tyr429Cysfs33*. The three patients commonly had the start codon-altering c.2T>G variant. Analysis of the mRNA and proteome of peripheral blood cells from one patient (c.2T>G and p.Arg426*) showed that CPOX mRNA expression was comparable to controls, however CPOX protein expression was significantly decreased to 1%.

Subsequent diagnostic steps are not consensual and are challenging for physicians due to miscellaneous causes and non-specific symptoms. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Gaucher disease (GD) and other etiologies in patients presenting with unexplained splenomegaly (SM) after exclusion of first intention-diagnoses (e.g., portal hypertension, hematological malignancy, hemolytic anemia, and infection) based on basic physical examination, patient interview, and routine biological exams (e.g., full blood count, liver enzymes, and reticulocyte count). Additionally, the study aimed to describe the diagnostic tests performed and the most frequent associations observed. This French prospective, observational, multicenter, longitudinal SMS study enrolled 505 patients from September 2015 to April 2020, aged â¥ 15 years, referred to hematology or internal medicine departments, with a diagnostically confirmed SM (spleen length â¥ 13 cm). SM was defined as unexplained when routine clinical and biological tests were negative. Patients were followed up until an etiology was identified or up to 18 months after inclusion. An etiology of SM was found in 223 (44.5%) of 501 patients with follow up. Patients with explained SM were older, had a larger spleen, and had altered biological parameters compared with patients with unexplained SM. There was a higher prevalence of non-malignant diseases than hematological malignancies (27.1% vs. 17.0%). Overall, lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) were diagnosed in 10 patients (2.0%), including 4 patients with GD (0.8%). A list of potential predictive factors for the main diagnostic categories was identified that could optimize the diagnostic strategy for unexplained SM.

{"text": "Acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are associated with increased morbidity and earlier mortality for people living with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The most common causes of PEx in CF are by bacterial infection and concomitant inflammation leading to progressive airway damage. To draw attention to the seriousness of PEx they have been labelled as 'lung attacks', much like a 'heart attack' for acute myocardial infarction. Treatment typically starts when a pwCF presents with worsening respiratory symptoms. Hence, there is a pressing need to identify indicative biomarkers of PEx onset to allow more timely intervention. Set within an ecological framework, we investigated temporal microbiota dynamics to connect changes in the lung microbiota of pwCF to changes in disease states across a PEx event. Species-time relationships (STR) describe how the richness of a community changes with time, here STRs were used to assess temporal turnover (w) within the lung microbiota of each pwCF (n = 12, mean sample duration 315.9 Â± 42.7 days). STRs were characterised by high interpatient variability, indicating that turnover and hence temporal organization are a personalized feature of the CF lung microbiota. Greater turnover was found to be significantly associated with greater change in lung function with time. When microbiota turnover was examined at a finer scale across each pwCF time series, w-values could clearly be observed to increase in the exacerbation period, then peaking within the treatment period, demonstrating that increases in turnover were not solely a result of perturbations caused by PEx antibiotic interventions. STR w-values have been found to have a remarkable degree of similarity for different organisms, in a variety of habitats and ecosystems, and time lengths (typically not exceeding w = 0.5). Here, we found w-values soon increased beyond that. It was therefore possible to use the departure from that expected norm up to start of treatment to approximate onset of PEx in days (21.2 Â± 8.9 days across the study participants). Here, we illustrate that changes in turnover of the lung microbiota of pwCF can be indicative of PEx onset in considerable advance of when treatment would normally be initiated. This offers translational potential to enable early detection of PEx and consequent timely intervention.

Diabetic women with HFpEF represent a high-risk subgroup, particularly after experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), exhibiting increased mortality compared to men.

Using an integrated clinical and pre-clinical approach this study aimed to investigate the relative contributions of metabolic dysfunction and coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) to STEMI outcomes in women, beyond the impact of DTB time. A retrospective case-control study analysed female STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI, n = 40 T2D, n = 40 non-diabetic controls), comparing clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and early outcomes.

In diabetic women, multiple factors beyond reperfusion delays exacerbate acute myocardial injury. This necessitates the development of sex-specific strategies to manage the cardiovascular complications of diabetic HFpEF.

A cohort of 449 asymptomatic T2DM patients was categorized into four groups: those without DN(G0) and those with DN, which was further subdivided into stages G1, G2, and G3. Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left atrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains during the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we investigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN group were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death. (1) Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic data for left ventricular size or function across groups. (2) Correlation analysis after multivariable adjustment revealed that the LA minimal volume index (LAVImin) increased with the progression of DN, while the absolute value of the LA strain index(reservoir and conduit period) decreased as renal damage worsened, exhibiting a highly significant correlation with the GFR (P < 0.01). (3) Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that: LAVmin, LASr, GFR, and HbA1c were associated with MACEs in patients with DN. Incorporating LAVmin and LASr into the basic model significantly enhanced the predictive value for MACEs in DN patients (with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.818, sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of 85.4%).

In this meta-analysis of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of colchicine in coronary artery disease (CAD), we updated the estimates of effect on cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. We searched for the largest RCTs of colchicine in CAD patients. The effect was assessed in a pooled analysis of individual events such as MI, urgent coronary revascularization (UR), stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality, for each of these endpoints using hazard ratios (HR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI), estimated by the Cox model. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were used. A similar approach was used for the composite of MI, UR, and cardiovascular mortality (MACE 1) and stroke, MI, total mortality (MACE 2). Safety was also assessed. Five studies were selected with a total of 18,656 patients. Colchicine reduced the risk of MI by 21 %, HR 0.79 (95 % CI: 0.68 - 0.92).Its effect was neutral on total and cardiovascular mortality.

{"text": "The protein IkappaB-Zeta (IÎºBÎ¶), which is a member of the IkappaB (IÎºB) family, has been implicated in the onset and progression of immune-mediated inflammation and cancer. However, its role in cardiovascular disease remains totally unexplored. We employed advanced molecular techniques to investigate the upregulation of IÎºBÎ¶ protein in mouse models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cellular oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), with a focus on nuclear localization. Our results indicate that inhibiting IÎºBÎ¶ protein expression both in vivo and in vitro can reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and alleviate cardiac hypoxic injury. Mechanistically, IÎºBÎ¶ influences cardiomyocyte apoptosis by binding to and regulating the activity of the intracellular signal transduction factor and transcriptional activator (STAT3). Upon AMI occurrence, the janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway is activated, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. It interacts with activated IÎºBÎ¶ in the nucleus, resulting in decreased STAT3 activity and exacerbating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Treatment with a STAT3-specific agonist mitigated the pro-apoptotic effects caused by IÎºBÎ¶ overexpression. In conclusion, our study describes for the first time the molecular link in IÎºBÎ¶ and STAT3 and reveals that pro-apoptotic IÎºBÎ¶ plays a crucial role in AMI pathogenesis by downregulating STAT3 activity. These findings suggest that targeting IÎºBÎ¶ may provide a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction.", "entities": [{"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 5, "end": 11, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 5, "end": 11, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 152, "end": 163, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 152, "end": 163, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 169, "end": 174, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 169, "end": 174, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 190, "end": 193, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "start": 198, "end": 219, "matched_text": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "start": 360, "end": 386, "matched_text": "ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OGD", "start": 435, "end": 437, "matched_text": "OGD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LOCALIZATION", "start": 465, "end": 476, "matched_text": "LOCALIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 593, "end": 601, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 703, "end": 709, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INTRACELLULAR SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "start": 749, "end": 781, "matched_text": "INTRACELLULAR SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "STAT3", "start": 821, "end": 825, "matched_text": "STAT3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "JANUS KINASE 2", "start": 854, "end": 867, "matched_text": "JANUS KINASE 2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "JAK2", "start": 921, "end": 924, "matched_text": "JAK2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 933, "end": 949, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 982, "end": 996, "matched_text": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSLOCATION", "start": 1017, "end": 1029, "matched_text": "TRANSLOCATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NUCLEUS", "start": 1040, "end": 1046, "matched_text": "NUCLEUS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NUCLEUS", "start": 1040, "end": 1046, "matched_text": "NUCLEUS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 1448, "end": 1459, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "start": 1645, "end": 1665, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "start": 1645, "end": 1665, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Directional Coronary Atherectomy (DCA) is a potential treatment option for left main (LM) bifurcation lesions, as it may prevent side branch occlusion and reduce the need for complex stenting. Recent studies have suggested that combining drug-coated balloon (DCB) with DCA can lead to favorable cardiovascular outcomes. However, the comparative efficacy of DCB and current drug-eluting stents (DES) following DCA for LM bifurcation lesions remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DCB and DES following DCA for LM bifurcation lesions. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 109 patients treated with DCA for LM bifurcation lesions from 2016 to 2024. Patients were divided into groups of DCA+DCB (n=58) and DCA+DES (n=51). The primary endpoint was ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR), and the secondary endpoint was target lesion-related myocardial infarction (TLMI). Lesion characteristics were evaluated using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed higher ID-TLR occurrence at 5 years in the DCA+DCB group than the DCA+DES group (16.4% vs. 2.3%, P=0.027). In contrast, TLMI occurrence was similar (4.7% vs. 2.3%, P=0.667). The DCA+DCB group exhibited greater residual diameter stenosis (24.4% vs. 16.3%, P<0.001) on QCA and smaller minimum lumen area (7.33 mmÂ² vs. 8.42 mmÂ², P<0.001) and greater residual plaque area (48.9% vs. 45.3%, P=0.027) on IVUS compared to the DCA+DES group. In conclusion, the DCA+DCB strategy was associated with a higher ID-TLR incidence and a smaller luminal gain than DCA+DES.

{"text": "Ischemic stroke (IS) is a life-threatening condition in humans with high morbidity and mortality rates in developing and industrialized countries. The occlusion of blood-supporting vessels by thrombus or emboli can contribute to massive brain cell damage, neurological deficits, and long-term disability, and in more severe conditions, results in sudden death. Current therapeutic strategies, along with rehabilitation, in part, but not completely, can restore the integrity and function of the brain. These features necessitate the advent of novel therapeutic protocols for yielding better regenerative outcomes in IS patients. In past decades, the discovery of stem cells and byproducts has led to promising results in in vitro settings and pre-clinical studies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles released from various cell types, for instance, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with certain signaling biomolecules, growth factors, and cytokines involved in cell-to-cell communication. A great plethora of studies have pointed to the fact that EVs with specific cargo can distribute easily in different parts of the body, making them appropriate therapeutics under different pathological conditions.

{"text": "Proprioceptive impairments of the upper limb are common after stroke. These impairments are not typically addressed during assessment or rehabilitation. Currently, most robotic paradigms for training of the upper limb have focused solely on improving motor function or have targeted proprioception in individuals with combined use of visual feedback. Our goal was to design a training paradigm that directly targets proprioception of the upper limb, while minimizing reliance on other sensory information to improve sensorimotor function after stroke. In this pilot study, 5 individuals with stroke and 5 age-matched controls were tested on a single-day proprioceptive training paradigm. Here, participants used a joystick with their less-affected arm to send commands to a KINARM exoskeleton that would passively move their more-affected arm. To complete the passive reaching task, participants relied only on proprioceptive feedback from the more-affected arm and were only given knowledge of results information after each trial. Sensorimotor function of the upper limb was measured pre- and post-training via robotic measures of motor function [Visually Guided Reaching (VGR)] and position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)]. Sensorimotor function was quantified as a Task Score, which incorporated multiple task-relevant parameters for both VGR and APM. Changes in sensorimotor performance due to training were calculated as the pre- to post-training difference for VGR and APM within the control and stroke groups. We found significant improvements from pre-training to post-training for VGR in individuals with stroke (p < 0.001, CLES = 100) that were not observed in control participants (p = 0.87, CLES = 80). We observed significant changes from pre- to post-training in both VGR (Posture Speed, Reaction Time, Initial Direction Angle, Min-Max Speed Difference, and Movement Time) and APM (Contraction/Expansion Ratio Our novel proprioceptive training paradigm is one of the first to implement a self-guided sensory training protocol. We observed improvements in motor function and proprioception for individuals with stroke. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of self-guided proprioceptive training to improve motor and sensory function in individuals with stroke.

A cohort of 449 asymptomatic T2DM patients was categorized into four groups: those without DN(G0) and those with DN, which was further subdivided into stages G1, G2, and G3. Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left atrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains during the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we investigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN group were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death. (1) Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic data for left ventricular size or function across groups. (2) Correlation analysis after multivariable adjustment revealed that the LA minimal volume index (LAVImin) increased with the progression of DN, while the absolute value of the LA strain index(reservoir and conduit period) decreased as renal damage worsened, exhibiting a highly significant correlation with the GFR (P < 0.01). (3) Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that: LAVmin, LASr, GFR, and HbA1c were associated with MACEs in patients with DN. Incorporating LAVmin and LASr into the basic model significantly enhanced the predictive value for MACEs in DN patients (with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.818, sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of 85.4%). The increase in LA volume and weakened reservoir and conduit function in T2DM patients dynamically reflect the severity of renal damage.

{"text": "To date, our understanding of the relationship between middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-induced ischemia stroke and circular RNAs (circRNAs) remains limited. The objective of this research was to explore the roles and underlying mechanisms of the circDnajc1/miR-27a-5p/C1qc signaling pathway in the development of ischemia stroke. For in vitro experiments, an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model was established following neuron-microglia co-culture. circDnajc1 siRNA and pcDNA3.1-circDnajc1 overexpression vectors were constructed and transfected into primary microglia. For in vivo experiments, an MCAO/R rat model was established. The molecular mechanisms were investigated using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro experiments showed that circDnajc1-induced cellular activation following microglia OGD/R injury, promoted the release of inflammatory factors, downregulated miR-27a-5p, upregulated C1qc, C3, and C5ar, and promotes neuronal apoptosis after microglia OGD/R injury. Interference with circDnajc1 reversed these effects. In vivo experiments, circDnajc1 knockdown exerted a protective effect on neurons in MCAO/R rats and inhibited microglial activation and the release of inflammatory factors. Consistent with the in vitro experiments, circDnajc1 regulated on the expression of downstream target genes of miR-27a-5p, C1qc, C3, and C5ar.

With the exoskeleton, stroke survivors stood up significantly faster (8.8% reduction in stand-up time), more symmetrically (13.7% increase in weight-bearing symmetry), and with less effort on their affected side (32% reduction in peak quadriceps muscle activation, 25% reduction in peak biological torque generation). The exoskeleton effectively supplemented the lack of strength in their affected knee, increasing the total knee torque by 59%, which more closely matched their non-affected knee.

Compared with warfarin, edoxaban offers non-inferior thromboembolic protection with a lower risk of major bleeding. However, with the increasing clinical use of edoxaban, reports of serious adverse events (AEs) have emerged, necessitating a comprehensive safety assessment. A comprehensive systematic literature search of 6 databases was conducted until December 2024. Case reports of serious AEs were included. Data extraction was performed using a structured Excel-based data collection form. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to summarize the characteristics of the cases. 41 cases of serious AEs met the inclusion criteria. 26 involved severe bleeding events, whereas 2 cases involved thrombotic events. 7 patients had medication errors. P-glycoprotein inhibitors were co-administered in 9 cases, contributing to increased bleeding risk, while P-gp inducers were used in 2 cases, potentially reducing edoxaban efficacy. The median time to AE onset was within one month in 18 cases, but 1 case occurred after four years of therapy. 6 patients died, of whom 4 deaths were attributed to AEs. This study highlights the clinical risks associated with edoxaban, particularly in elderly patients, those with impaired renal function, and those receiving concomitant P-gp inhibitors.

Results showed that one patient (Patient 3) exhibited a significant reduction in seizure duration and improved QOLIE-31 scores, with focal seizures being the only type observed after treatment. However, there was no statistically significant change in overall seizure frequency among the three patients.

While surgical resection is the primary treatment, its application is limited in generalized epilepsy. Centromedian nucleus neurostimulation offers a promising alternative, yet its mechanisms remain unclear, limiting target optimization. We present a multimodal approach integrating intraoperative thalamic and sub-scalp electroencephalogram recordings with post-implant reconstructions to define neural targets affected by centromedian nucleus stimulation. We find that stimulating low-activity regions near the centromedian nucleus, particularly the white matter of internal medullary lamina, induces significant cortical delta power increases greater than stimulation within high-activity areas inside the nucleus. Implantation in these low-activity targets results in greater than 50% seizure reduction in all three subjects. These findings suggest that seizure control primarily involves stimulating white matter regions such as the internal medullary lamina rather than the centromedian nucleus itself.

Inefficient differentiation of naÃ¯ve oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (OLs) is an essential pathological obstacle and a therapeutic target of myelin sheath repair. Our work discovers that diosgenin, a natural steroid sapogenin, distinct from its classic cardioprotective effects, directly stimulates OPCs maturation predominantly in the corpus callosum, assuring CNS myelin recovery. To study the action of diosgenin on CNS myelin repair, we developed a pilocarpine mouse model of epilepsy and an in vitro seizure model. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and molecular docking map were employed to clarify the target and underlying mechanism of diosgenin on myelin repair promotion. Diosgenin greatly fostered OPCs differentiation in the corpus callosum. Of note, this action of diosgenin on OPCs was via targeting and stabilizing 122â¼221 amino acid residues of GLUR2 subunit, thereby disrupted its interaction with GAPDH protein and subsequent GAPDH nucleus translocation in vitro.

{"text": "The desire for permanent cosmetic change of eye color has driven the development of various surgical techniques aimed at achieving this transformation, pursuing more enduring solutions. This demand has led to the emergence of three primary surgical approaches: cosmetic iris implants, laser iris depigmentation, and cosmetic keratopigmentation (KTP). Each technique presents distinct advantages, yet also entails specific limitations and potential risks. Cosmetic iris implants, originally designed for congenital or traumatic iris defects, have been repurposed for aesthetic use. However, they come with severe risks, including glaucoma, corneal endothelial cell loss, and even permanent vision impairment. As a result of these complications, they are not approved by major regulatory bodies and are widely considered unsafe. Laser iris depigmentation offers a less invasive approach, using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser to remove melanin from the anterior iris stroma. While it provides a natural-looking result, it lacks customization and has potential complications like patchy pigmentation, photophobia, and temporary intraocular pressure spikes. Additionally, there is limited long-term data on its safety. Cosmetic KTP, an advanced version of corneal tattooing, has emerged as the safest and most effective option. It involves embedding micronized mineral pigments into the cornea, allowing for precise, customizable, and long-lasting results. Studies show high patient satisfaction and minimal risks when properly performed. Among these techniques, KTP appears to be the best choice owing to its safety and aesthetic flexibility, while cosmetic iris implants should be avoided because of their high risk of complications, and laser iris depigmentation deals with limitations in color selection and long-term reliability. While KTP currently seems the safest option for cosmetic eye color change, this is largely based on limited single-center data and should be confirmed by larger studies in the future.", "entities": [{"entity": "EYE", "start": 45, "end": 47, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 45, "end": 47, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "IRIS", "start": 271, "end": 274, "matched_text": "IRIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GLAUCOMA", "start": 630, "end": 637, "matched_text": "GLAUCOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GLAUCOMA", "start": 630, "end": 637, "matched_text": "GLAUCOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ENDOTHELIAL CELL", "start": 648, "end": 663, "matched_text": "ENDOTHELIAL CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VISION IMPAIRMENT", "start": 690, "end": 706, "matched_text": "VISION IMPAIRMENT", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PIGMENTATION", "start": 1079, "end": 1090, "matched_text": "PIGMENTATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHOTOPHOBIA", "start": 1093, "end": 1103, "matched_text": "PHOTOPHOBIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PHOTOPHOBIA", "start": 1093, "end": 1103, "matched_text": "PHOTOPHOBIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 1185, "end": 1188, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORNEA", "start": 1378, "end": 1383, "matched_text": "CORNEA", "type": "disease"}]}

{"text": "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with an estimated 112 million people projected to be affected by 2040. The primary risk factor for POAG is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which is primarily driven by increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow through the conventional outflow pathway. Despite its prevalence, the precise biomechanical mechanisms underlying this resistance remain unclear. In this study, we utilized 3D in situ traction force microscopy to investigate the effects of the rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 and the YAP/TAZ inhibitor Verteporfin treatments on the trabecular meshwork (TM) and juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) cellular contractility and their extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization in both normal and glaucomatous human donor eyes. Our analysis revealed dysregulated traction forces within glaucomatous tissues, leading to significant ECM reorganization that may contribute to disrupting the homeostasis of the aqueous outflow pathway. Treatments appear to help restore normal ECM structure by adjusting cellular forces. The effect on contractile forces differed between genders, suggesting the significance of gender in treatment response.

Advances in the identification of metabolomic biomarkers can improve current clinical practices. These biomarkers can complement existing diagnostic tools, allowing for earlier detection and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges remain, including a lack of standardization in metabolomics protocols, variability in disease progression and finally, recording treatment non-response currently also suffers from a lack of standardization toward depicting treatment outcomes.

Wound healing efficiency and anti-oxidant potential of the small extracellular vesicles (sEV) isolated from the adult tissue-resident stem cells of the trabecular meshwork (TMSC) compared to trabecular meshwork (TM) cells have been demonstrated. This study aimed to compare the protein profile of extracellular vesicles derived from TMSCs and TM cells for a better understanding of their potential as a cell-free therapeutic agent for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Proteins were isolated from TM and TMSC sEV samples (n = 3 each) and proteomic profiling was carried out by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 2802 proteins in TMSC sEV and 2848 in TM sEV. Differential expression analysis identified distinct protein profiles between TMSC and TM sEV. Notably, sEV from TMSCs were enriched with proteins associated with wound healing, cell proliferation, migration, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities, consistent with the findings in other mesenchymal stem cells. Pathway analysis highlighted the enrichment of proteins associated with PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Further validation by western blotting confirmed that TMSC sEV effectively modulated these pathways in TM cells, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival under oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive protein profiling of TMSC-derived sEV, demonstrating the presence of functional proteins and their capacity to regulate the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways in the recipient TM cells.

Many patients required multiple surgical interventions after explantation, highlighting the long-term morbidity associated with these devices. The authors recommend that cosmetic iris implantation should be banned worldwide given the substantial risks and lack of therapeutic value, and greater regulatory oversight is needed to prevent further harm to patients.", "entities": [{"entity": "IRIS", "start": 82, "end": 85, "matched_text": "IRIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 204, "end": 206, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 204, "end": 206, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ENDOTHELIAL CELL", "start": 627, "end": 642, "matched_text": "ENDOTHELIAL CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 661, "end": 667, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CCT", "start": 688, "end": 690, "matched_text": "CCT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UVEITIS", "start": 911, "end": 917, "matched_text": "UVEITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UVEITIS", "start": 911, "end": 917, "matched_text": "UVEITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GLAUCOMA", "start": 920, "end": 927, "matched_text": "GLAUCOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GLAUCOMA", "start": 920, "end": 927, "matched_text": "GLAUCOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CATARACT", "start": 954, "end": 961, "matched_text": "CATARACT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CATARACT", "start": 954, "end": 961, "matched_text": "CATARACT", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 963, "end": 971, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ELEVATED IOP", "start": 1146, "end": 1157, "matched_text": "ELEVATED IOP", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MEMBRANE", "start": 1239, "end": 1246, "matched_text": "MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 2119, "end": 2122, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LACK", "start": 2278, "end": 2281, "matched_text": "LACK", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and a major cause of blindness. The two most important risk factors for glaucoma are ocular hypertension (OHT) and advanced age. In this study, we explored the combined impact of aging and OHT on retinal neuronal and microvasculature health. We induced OHT using the bead-injection model in 12 week old (young) and 1.5 year old (old) mice and monitored intraocular pressure (IOP) for 2 weeks. We then explored vascular phenotypes, blood retinal barrier components, RGC counts, and electroretinogram (ERG) changes. Aged mice displayed reduced retinal microvasculature complexity, retinal vascular phenotypes in all three retinal capillary plexi (RCPs), and abnormal ERGs. Aging also impacted basement membrane (BM) and tight junction (TJ) morphology. The impact of OHT was much more evident in old mice; RGC loss was exacerbated, retinal vascular phenotypes were magnified across all three RCPs, and BM and TJ phenotypes were much more severe. However, the impact of OHT on retinal function was unchanged in old mice. Interestingly, the nature of these phenotypes was not equivalent among all RCPs, suggesting regional shared and distinct susceptibilities to aging and OHT. Taken together, aging causes multiple neurovascular phenotypes in mouse retinas, and OHT causes more severe effects in old mice. This suggests an interaction between aging and OHT that may help explain the increased prevalence of glaucoma in older humans.", "entities": [{"entity": "GLAUCOMA", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "GLAUCOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GLAUCOMA", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "GLAUCOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NERVE", "start": 55, "end": 59, "matched_text": "NERVE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GANGLION", "start": 73, "end": 80, "matched_text": "GANGLION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLINDNESS", "start": 116, "end": 124, "matched_text": "BLINDNESS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLINDNESS", "start": 116, "end": 124, "matched_text": "BLINDNESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OCULAR HYPERTENSION", "start": 180, "end": 198, "matched_text": "OCULAR HYPERTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OCULAR HYPERTENSION", "start": 180, "end": 198, "matched_text": "OCULAR HYPERTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 429, "end": 432, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 526, "end": 530, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RGC", "start": 560, "end": 562, "matched_text": "RGC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERG", "start": 595, "end": 597, "matched_text": "ERG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CAPILLARY", "start": 723, "end": 731, "matched_text": "CAPILLARY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BASEMENT MEMBRANE", "start": 786, "end": 802, "matched_text": "BASEMENT MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TIGHT JUNCTION", "start": 813, "end": 826, "matched_text": "TIGHT JUNCTION", "type": "gene"}]}

Intestinal wall inflammation with villi atrophy results in malabsorption of nutrients and leads to several gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. High serum levels of anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies can be revealed in patients with CD. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 complement deposits in the oral mucosa and its condition in CD patients. Thirty CD patients underwent complete clinical examination followed by mycologic evaluation, of whom 10 additionally had oral mucosa biopsy. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was performed on the oral mucosa specimens using polyclonal rabbit IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 antibodies. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common complaints included pain due to oral ulcers, xerostomia, and gingival bleeding. Frequently observed comorbidities were anemia, allergy, and thyroid disorders. Common oral mucosal findings included white-coated tongue, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis. Candidiasis was revealed in 13 subjects (43.3%). IgA, IgG, IgM, or C3 deposits in the oral mucosa specimens were shown in none of the patients. Coeliac disease may increase the frequency of white-coated tongue, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis and may promote the development of oral candidiasis.

We calculated the rates of common health conditions and explored differences between White European and South Asian participants. 21 health conditions were identified using diagnostic codes and prescription records extracted from electronic health records. We calculated 2-year period prevalence before recruitment and incidence rates per 1000 person-years were calculated from recruitment to the end of 2021 (or censoring). Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HR) by ethnicity. The sample included 9,784 mothers, 52% were of South Asian heritage and 48% were White European. The highest prevalence and incidence rates were observed for common mental health disorders and eczema. South Asian women had higher incidence of 14 conditions, including diabetes (HR 3.94 [95% CI 3.15, 4.94]), chronic liver disease (2.98 [2.29, 3.88]) and thyroid disorders (1.87 [1.50, 2.33]), but lower incidence of cancer (0.51 [0.38, 0.68]), other and common mental health disorders (0.56 [0.45, 0.71] and 0.69 [0.64, 0.74] respectively), and other neuromuscular conditions (0.63 [0.49, 0.82]). This study reveals significant differences in the occurrence of several non-communicable health conditions between White European and South Asian women. The observed higher incidence of several conditions in South Asian women, consistent with established knowledge regarding elevated risks for diseases such as diabetes, likely reflects the complex interplay of social, cultural, lifestyle, environmental, and genetic determinants. These findings emphasise the need for culturally sensitive and targeted public health interventions aimed at addressing modifiable risk factors at both the individual and systemic levels to alleviate the burden of long-term health conditions and reduce existing health inequalities. Born in Bradford is a research study which aims to find out what keeps families healthy by tracking the lives of over 40,000 people living in Bradford, which is a city in the north of England. We looked at the medical history of nearly 10,000 mothers taking part in the study to see how many had developed one or more of 21 health conditions since they joined the study. We found that women of South Asian heritage were more likely to develop diabetes, chronic liver disease, and thyroid disorders compared to white women, but were less likely to develop cancer, common mental health disorders and neuromuscular conditions such as fibromyalgia. These differences may be explained by social, cultural, lifestyle, environmental and genetic factors, and it is important to understand why this happens.

An ethically-approved, single-centre, controlled, examiner-blind, randomized, two-treatment arm, parallel study in consenting healthy â¥18yr participants with â¥20 teeth diagnosed with localised gingivitis. Approximately 200 eligible participants brushed for 2weeks with a fluoride acclimatization toothpaste before randomization to brushing 2/daily with a sodium bicarbonate (test) or fluoride (control) toothpaste. No pre-prophylaxis was conducted prior to study start. Modified gingival index (MGI), bleeding index (BI) and Turesky plaque index (TPI), were measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12weeks. Participants completed a diary for compliance monitoring. 190 participants were randomised, 188 completed the study. The test group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in number of bleeding sites from baseline to 12-weeks (p=0.0032), 6-weeks (p=0.0031) and 3-weeks (p=0.0091), and compared to control group from baseline to 12-weeks (p=0.0013).

A literature search was conducted in August 2024 in two electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed), and EBSCO, and Google Scholar for articles written in English reporting periodontal diseases in pregnant adolescents (15-19 years) and young adults (20-24 years) in Nigeria following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). This review excluded abstracts, literature reviews, conference proceedings, letters to the editor, and editorials. Information extracted from the publications that met the inclusion criteria were the study design, study location, sample size, gestation stage, prevalence of periodontal diseases, and identified risk factors for periodontal diseases. A descriptive analysis of the extracted data was conducted. Among the 768 articles screened, no study met the eligibility criteria. However, four studies reported on risk factors for periodontal diseases in a sample of 1066 pregnant women age < 20 years to > 40 years that included 202 (18.9%) pregnant adolescents and young adults. The prevalence of periodontal diseases ranged from 45.8 to 100%. One study reported that the highest score of healthy gingivae was among the 20-24 age group; one study reported that prevalence of gingivitis increased with increasing trimester; another reported the highest prevalence of gingival bleeding and the lowest prevalence of calculus in the first trimester, while one study could not establish a statistically significant relationship between periodontal diseases and gestational age.

{"text": "To leverage technological advances to propose a more accurate representation of subgingival microbiota diversity and dynamics across health and disease, 25 years after the seminal and still authoritative contribution of Socransky and his colleagues. Subgingival plaque from 135 patients (41 healthy, 47 gingivitis, 47 periodontitis) was analysed by V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Sequences were probabilistically assigned to unambiguous taxon groups (UTGs) using advanced bioinformatics. Beyond univariate analyses across health groups, samples were re-classified into microbiota patterns using unsupervised clustering. Bacterial community ordination was performed via correlation analysis. In total, 394 fully characterized UTGs were detected with a confidence level of at least 98% in all samples, with an average of 157 in each sample and 162 representing more than 95% of the bacteriome. Hierarchical clustering identified 10 UTG complexes, with 1 particularly associated with health (Complex 6) and 1 with disease (Complex 10). Complex 10 corresponded to 29 taxa, among which the three species from Socransky's red complex and additional 8 Treponema UTGs, as well as species from the orange complex. Complex 6 comprised species from Socransky's green, yellow and purple complexes. While gingivitis appeared as an intermediate state between health and periodontitis, k-clustering revealed five microbiota patterns related to disease progression, and with specific contributions of bacterial complexes, evidencing alternative pathophysiological routes. These 10 new complexes offer an entry point to understanding plaque ecology, beyond the complexity of microbial dynamics in the periodontal microenvironments revealed by the variability within these groups and the existence of 'boundary taxa' linking them. These microbial complexes co-exist in specific microenvironments, and shifts in their relative abundance mark the transition from a healthy microbiota to a diseased microbiota, with intermediary patterns in between. We propose to use these patterns as indicators for the classification of periodontal diseases along a microbial risk scale to complement the current staging and grading system.", "entities": [{"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 145, "end": 151, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GINGIVITIS", "start": 304, "end": 313, "matched_text": "GINGIVITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GINGIVITIS", "start": 304, "end": 313, "matched_text": "GINGIVITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PERIODONTITIS", "start": 319, "end": 331, "matched_text": "PERIODONTITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PERIODONTITIS", "start": 319, "end": 331, "matched_text": "PERIODONTITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "UTG", "start": 927, "end": 929, "matched_text": "UTG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RED", "start": 1113, "end": 1115, "matched_text": "RED", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TREPONEMA", "start": 1142, "end": 1150, "matched_text": "TREPONEMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MARK", "start": 1915, "end": 1918, "matched_text": "MARK", "type": "protein"}]}

The objective of the present study was to investigate the composition of the microbial association of the periodontal pocket in patients exhibiting varying degrees of periodontal tissue damage. The microbiologic composition of periodontal pocket contents was studied in a cohort of 34 patients diagnosed with K05.3 Chronic periodontitis. The state of periodontal tissues was evaluated using clinical, instrumental, and radiologic examination methods. The contents of the periodontal pocket were utilized as a subject for examination. The primary identification of microorganisms was carried out by means of the MALDI TOF MS method. The results of the study indicated the presence of various indicators of microbial composition in patients exhibiting different degrees of periodontal tissue lesions. The contents of the periodontal pocket were found to contain both aerobic and anaerobic representatives of bacterial flora. Furthermore, the presence of representatives from the periodontopathogenic spectrum of microorganisms was detected.

{"text": "Sex hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, undergo continuous fluctuations throughout a woman's life, beginning at puberty and extending through the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. These hormonal variations significantly influence gingival health, leading to various periodontal conditions. During puberty, elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone enhance blood circulation to the gingival tissues, increasing their sensitivity to plaque and resulting in puberty gingivitis. This condition is characterized by gingival enlargement, redness, and bleeding. Throughout the menstrual cycle, hormonal fluctuations can cause menstrual gingivitis, presenting as inflamed and bleeding gums, typically occurring prior to menstruation and subsiding thereafter. Pregnancy induces substantial hormonal changes, with heightened estrogen and progesterone levels exacerbating gingival inflammation. This often leads to pregnancy gingivitis, marked by swelling, bleeding, and tenderness of the gums. In some cases, a localized overgrowth known as a pyogenic granuloma or \"pregnancy tumor\" may develop on the gingiva. The use of oral contraceptives, which alter hormonal levels, has been associated with increased gingival inflammation and exudate, similar to the effects observed during pregnancy. Menopause brings a significant decline in estrogen levels, leading to various oral health issues such as dry mouth (xerostomia), a burning sensation in the mouth, and an increased risk of osteoporosis affecting the alveolar bone supporting the teeth. These changes contribute to a heightened susceptibility to periodontal diseases in post-menopausal women. The influence of estrogen and progesterone on the immune response, oral microbial composition, bone density, and enzymes like collagenase plays a crucial role in modulating gingival inflammation and the risk of periodontal diseases.

{"text": "Endometriosis is a serious multifocal condition that can involve various pelvic structures, with Pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration being a significant clinical indicator for diagnosis. To circumvent the need for invasive diagnostic procedures like laparoscopy, research has increasingly focused on imaging-based methods such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The limited diagnostic accuracy achieved through manual interpretation of these imaging techniques has driven the development of automated classifiers that can effectively utilize both modalities. However, patients often undergo only one of these two examinations, resulting in unpaired data for training and testing POD obliteration classifiers, where TVUS models tend to be more accurate than MRI models, but TVUS scanning are more operator dependent. This prompts a crucial question: Can a model be trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data to enhance the performance of a model exclusively trained with MRI, while maintaining the high accuracy of the model individually trained with TVUS? In this paper we aim to answer this question by proposing a novel multi-modal POD obliteration classifier that is trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data and tested using either MRI or TVUS data. Our method is the first POD obliteration classifier that can flexibly take either the TVUS or MRI data, where the model automatically focuses on the uterus region within MRI data, eliminating the need for any manual intervention. Experiments conducted on our endometriosis dataset show that our method significantly improves POD obliteration classification accuracy using MRI from AUC=0.4755 (single-modal training and testing, without automatically focusing on the uterus region) to 0.8023 (unpaired multi-modal training and single modality MRI testing, with automatic uterus region detection), while maintaining the accuracy using TVUS with AUC=0.8921 (single modality TVUS testing using either an unpaired multi-modal training or a single-modality training).", "entities": [{"entity": "ENDOMETRIOSIS", "start": 1, "end": 13, "matched_text": "ENDOMETRIOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ENDOMETRIOSIS", "start": 1, "end": 13, "matched_text": "ENDOMETRIOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MULTIFOCAL", "start": 28, "end": 37, "matched_text": "MULTIFOCAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MRI", "start": 394, "end": 396, "matched_text": "MRI", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UTERUS", "start": 1436, "end": 1441, "matched_text": "UTERUS", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Endometriosis is a pathological condition in which endometrial cells proliferate outside the uterine cavity, resulting in pelvic pain and infertility. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been implicated in the progression of endometriosis, though the precise mechanisms remain largely undefined. Among EDCs, elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-126 have been strongly associated with endometriosis, particularly in patients with deep infiltrating disease. In a mouse model of endometriosis, PCB-126 exposure significantly promoted the growth of ectopic lesions by activating the Steroid Receptor Coactivator-1 (SRC-1) isoform/Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9)/Estrogen Receptor-Î² (ERÎ²) axis, a key driver of disease progression. PCB-126 also enhanced ERÎ² activity via upregulation of the AXL Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (AXL)/Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) signaling pathway in endometriotic lesions. Notably, BMS-777607, an AXL inhibitor, effectively suppressed lesion growth in this model. Moreover, the PCB-126/ERÎ² axis directly increased expression of DNA Methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), contributing to inflammation and immune dysregulation in endometriotic tissue.

Specifically, it compared ovarian responses between a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol, used as a conventional controlled ovarian stimulation method, and a progesterone-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol, considered a relatively new method. This retrospective, observational study was conducted at a single in vitro fertilization clinic in Tokyo, Japan, from April 2022 to March 2024. The study population included infertile patients who were scheduled for treatment and met the inclusion criteria. Eligible participants were Japanese women aged 20-45 years with preserved ovarian function, indicated by an anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone level of â¥0.8 ng/mL. Exclusion criteria included contraindications for follitropin delta, previous oocyte stimulation for egg donation or fertility preservation, follicle-stimulating hormone levels â¥35 mIU/mL, uncontrolled malignant disease, stage III/IV endometriosis, and the use of hormone preparations (excluding thyroid medication) during the last menstrual cycle prior to study entry. The primary endpoint was the pregnancy rate per transfer in GnRH antagonist and PPOS cycles. Secondary endpoints included the number of oocytes retrieved and the blastocyst formation rate. Ongoing pregnancy was defined as a pregnancy in which a fetal heart rate was confirmed by 10 weeks of gestation. Accumulated data from GnRH antagonist cycles and PPOS cycles at the institution were combined to compare oocyte retrieval outcomes and pregnancy rates per transfer. Additionally, a stratified analysis by age (<35, 35-39, and â¥40 years) was performed. Accumulated data included 149 GnRH antagonist cycles and 147 PPOS cycles. Oocyte retrieval outcomes and pregnancy rates per transfer were compared between the two protocols. There was no significant difference in the number of oocytes retrieved. However, the number of blastocysts showed a higher trend in the PPOS group compared to the GnRH antagonist group (p = 0.065). Across all age groups, the PPOS cycle tended to yield higher numbers of retrieved oocytes and blastocysts. Nonetheless, no significant difference was observed in the pregnancy rate per transfer between the two protocols. Both the GnRH antagonist and PPOS protocols demonstrated trends toward higher numbers of retrieved oocytes and blastocysts, with comparable pregnancy rates across all age groups, suggesting similar clinical outcomes.

Several markers have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, none is sufficiently reliable to enable accurate diagnosis. We characterized a broad panel of serum proteins to assess disease-specific biomarker profiles and associate these findings with faecal microbiota composition in newly diagnosed IBD and IBS patients and healthy individuals. The study cohort consisted of 49 newly diagnosed treatment-naÃ¯ve adult patients (13 Crohn's disease (CD), 13 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 23 IBS) and 12 healthy individuals. Inflammatory and metabolism-related serum proteins were assessed using PEA multiplex panels, while gut microbiota composition was determined by 16 s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Serum proteins AXIN1, TNFSF14, RNASE3, EN-RAGE, OSM, ST1A1, CA13 and NADK were identified as markers with the most promising specificity/sensitivity and predictivity between healthy and disease groups, while IL-17A and TNFRSF9 enabled differentiation between IBD and IBS patients. Increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was associated with protein markers significantly elevated in IBD/IBS. In contrast, depletion of beneficial taxa like Ruminococcaceae and Verucomicrobiaceae (i.e. Akkermansia muciniphila) was associated with decrease of a set of markers in diseased groups.

{"text": "Observational studies have suggested correlations between mood instability and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, however, the causal relationships remain unclear. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationships between mood instability and 22 GI disorders using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from disease-relevant GWAS studies, the UK Biobank, and the FinnGen project. To ensure the robustness of causal estimates, we applied multiple MR methods and extensive sensitivity analyses. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step mediation analyses were performed to explore direct causal effects and potential mediating factors. After multiple-testing correction, genetic liability to mood instability was significantly associated with an increased risk of four GI disorders: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticular disease, and cholelithiasis. Reverse MR analysis further suggested that genetically predicted GERD and IBS also increased the risk of mood instability. These findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses and were validated in independent datasets. Moreover, MVMR and mediation analyses indicated that smoking and depression may partially mediate the causal effects on GERD. Mood instability, as a personality trait, may play a causal role in the development of multiple GI disorders. Our findings suggest that behavioral interventions, such as smoking cessation, may help reduce GI risk among individuals prone to mood instability.

Further, we optimized the effect of temperature and growth media on the expression of ZIKV rEDIII. Our study establishes a systematic protocol for extracting functional ZIKV rEDIII since the majority of the expressed protein goes into inclusion bodies (IBs). We have optimized the refolding process of rEDIII in buffers with varying pH levels and demonstrated the association between the buffer environment and the refolding efficiency of ZIKV rEDIII.

A secondary objective was to explore the proposed associations between attentional indices and various aspects of anxiety and interoceptive accuracy. Ninety IBS patients and 77 healthy controls (HC) completed a set of questionnaires [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Anxious Thoughts Inventory (ATI)] followed by a heartbeat counting task and an emotional Stroop task. Repeated measures 2-way ANOVA showed no significant effects. GLMM results showed that IBS patients had shorter RTs (~50 ms) than HCs. The IBS group scored higher than HC in all anxiety measures, while there were no differences in IAcc. Positive correlations were found among all anxiety measures in both groups. There was a negative correlation of average RT with ASI, ATI, and IAcc, only in the IBS group. IBS patients with higher ASI and ATI have faster RTs, while patients with higher IAcc have lower RTs. Stroop facilitation was not replicated, but IBS patients were faster than HCs. This study provides preliminary evidence that IBS patients may show distinct attentional patterns, marked by a general tendency for faster engagement, independent of stimulus type.

Although the co-localization of SRUS and USMI has been demonstrated previously, USMI resolution is limited by ultrasound diffraction-based effects and does not match the super-resolved microvasculature. This study introduces the Incremental Burst Sequence (IBS) method to induce the population of polydisperse targeted MBs to burst progressively, achieving MBs spatial separation and enabling high-resolution USMI (HR-USMI) localization. IBS method employs interleaved imaging and bursting pulses, with transmit voltages of bursting pulses incrementally increased to produce a gradual rise in the acoustic pressure. IBS is first validated optically in vitro using a cellulose tubing phantom, and MB remaining count during IBS is measured. Thereafter, in vivo validation is performed in a murine tumor model, and the intra-tumoral targeted MB signal intensity is measured during IBS. Furthermore, high frame-rate data for SRUS and IBS data for HR-USMI are acquired from a single bolus injection of MBs to generate composite images with high-resolution molecular signatures superimposed on the tumor microvasculature. Both in vitro and in vivo results validate the technical feasibility of the proposed IBS method. In addition, we demonstrate that higher bursting pulse repetitions lead to a faster disruption of the MB population during IBS.

Additionally, it accounts for potential model misspecification, ensuring robustness across a wide range of settings. We assess the performance of CoxTL through extensive simulation studies, considering data under various types of distributional shifts. Additionally, we apply CoxTL to predict End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in the Hispanic population using electronic health record-derived features from the All of Us Research Program. Data from non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations are leveraged as source cohorts. Model performance is evaluated using the C-index and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). In simulation studies, CoxTL demonstrates higher predictive accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving multi-level heterogeneity between target and source datasets. In other scenarios, CoxTL performs comparably to alternative methods specifically designed to address only a single type of distributional shift. For predicting the 2-year risk of ESRD in the Hispanic population, CoxTL achieves an increase in C-index up to 6.76% compared to the model trained exclusively on target data. Furthermore, it demonstrates up to 17.94% increase in the C-index compared to the state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on Cox model.

Data for this retrospective cohort study were sourced from 746,060 individuals in the NHIS-NSC database, classified according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD) version 6, based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The drugs were also identified by their GNL code in Korea. We focused on individuals diagnosed with rosacea and their subsequent development of IBS. This study was conducted with 1,087 patients diagnosed with Rosacea between 2002 and 2013 in NHIS-NSC. A total of 4,348 controls were matched at 1:4 based on sex, age, and index data. Adjustments were made for potential confounders such as age, sex, and comorbidities through multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, to assess the risk of IBS among patients with rosacea compared to those without it. Our findings show that individuals with rosacea have a significantly higher incidence of IBS than those without rosacea. After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, the association remained significant, with rosacea patients showing a 21% increased risk of developing IBS compared to controls. The study also noted that the incidence of IBS increased as rosacea became chronic. The findings support the hypothesis that rosacea may be associated with an increased risk of IBS, potentially mediated by systemic inflammatory pathways and neurological interactions as suggested by the gut-skin axis.

Molecular docking also clarified the strong binding interactions between differential metabolites (leucine, salicylic acid, and fumaric acid) and osteogenic targets, providing new insights into plant component-microbe synergy in functional food development.

In the context of various chronic pathologies, this condition may present an even higher prevalence, impacting morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden. To synthesize and compare available evidence from systematic reviews on the prevalence of osteoporosis across different chronic diseases. An umbrella review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis) reporting prevalence data of osteoporosis in adults with at least one chronic disease. Databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE, were searched, covering publications between 2009 and 2023, without language restrictions. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction, resolving discrepancies through consensus. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the ROBIS tool. Prevalence estimates reported in each review were analyzed, classifying diseases according to the magnitude of the percentages found. Thirteen systematic reviews were evaluated (twelve included meta-analyses). The highest prevalence of osteoporosis was observed in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (up to 36.8%) and diabetes mellitus (approximately 27.7%). Other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, liver cirrhosis, and celiac disease, showed variable prevalence but were equally relevant in clinical terms. Methodological heterogeneity, both in diagnostic criteria and populations, was a notable factor.

This study delved into the impacts of gastrointestinal stress on S. boulardii and the corresponding adaptive mechanisms employed by the yeast at the membrane level using physiological methodologies. The findings demonstrated that exposure to gastrointestinal stress compromised cellular integrity, resulting in cell wall rupture and the subsequent leakage of intracellular contents. To mitigate the adverse effects of gastrointestinal stress, S. boulardii activated several membrane-associated defense strategies. Notably, there was a decrease in membrane fluidity, and significant alterations in fatty acid composition, including a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, intracellular ergosterol and glutathione levels were substantially elevated, contributing to the stabilization of the cell membrane and minimizing damage caused by gastrointestinal stress. Taken together, the comprehensive analysis presented in this study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in S. boulardii. These results support the enhancement of the application of probiotics in osteoporosis, especially for oral administration requiring resistance to gastrointestinal stress.", "entities": [{"entity": "OSTEOPOROSIS", "start": 64, "end": 75, "matched_text": "OSTEOPOROSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OSTEOPOROSIS", "start": 64, "end": 75, "matched_text": "OSTEOPOROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 102, "end": 105, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MEMBRANE", "start": 396, "end": 403, "matched_text": "MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL WALL", "start": 558, "end": 566, "matched_text": "CELL WALL", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INTRACELLULAR", "start": 606, "end": 618, "matched_text": "INTRACELLULAR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL MEMBRANE", "start": 1058, "end": 1070, "matched_text": "CELL MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1087, "end": 1092, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SALT TOLERANCE", "start": 1252, "end": 1265, "matched_text": "SALT TOLERANCE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APPLICATION", "start": 1329, "end": 1339, "matched_text": "APPLICATION", "type": "disease"}]}

{"text": "Accurate assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) is essential for diagnosing osteoporosis, but conventional quantitative CT protocols are associated with relatively high radiation doses. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a novel dual-parameter optimized ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT) protocol for quantitative BMD assessment in the lumbar spine, comparing its radiation dose, image quality, and diagnostic performance against standard-dose CT (SD-CT). In this prospective study, 245 patients undergoing lumbar surgery received paired pre- and postoperative CT scans: SD-CT (120kV/250mAs) and ULD-CT (100kV/30mAs). Radiation dose metrics (CTDIvol, DLP, effective dose [ED]), objective image quality (noise, SNR, CNR), and subjective quality (5-point Likert scale) were analyzed. Volumetric BMD (vBMD) was measured using QCT and classified per American College of Radiology criteria (normal, osteopenia, osteoporosis). Diagnostic performance was evaluated via sensitivity/specificity and ROC analysis. ULD-CT reduced radiation dose by 92.5% compared to SD-CT (ED: 0.88 vs. 11.68 mSv; CTDIvol: 1.93 vs. 25.66 mGy, both P < 0.001). While SD-CT demonstrated superior objective (P=0.001-0.01) and subjective image quality (P<0.001), ULD-CT maintained diagnostic acceptability (scores â¥3; interobserver ICC=0.73). ULD-CT showed slight BMD overestimation but no significant differences in gender, age, or osteoporosis subgroups (P>0.05). ROC analysis revealed high diagnostic accuracy for ULD-CT (AUC: 0.986-0.996), with sensitivity/specificity of 94.74-100% and 95.74-98.01%, respectively.

The FLS was associated with an additional cost of $50 and a gain of 0.03 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1663 per QALY, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a FLS program compared to current practice in Iran, from a societal perspective. The target population was patients aged 50 years or older with recent sentinel fragility fractures. Data were collected using various resources, including previously published literature, treatment guidelines, and hospitals. A state-based microsimulation model with a lifetime horizon was designed to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Treatment pathways for patients under current practice and FLS were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). For patients aged 50 years and older with a sentinel fragility fracture, FLS was associated with an incremental cost of $50 and a gain of 0.03 QALYs compared to current practice. Consequently, the ICER was estimated at $1663 per QALY gained, which is below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of one GDP per capita ($4466 per QALY). Simulations showed that comparing the current practice, FLS could prevent 59 new fractures and 10 related deaths per 1000 patients. The one-way sensitivity analysis indicated that treatment efficacy and medication costs exert the greatest influence on the ICER.

{"text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous disease with variable clinical and molecular features. Studies have highlighted the significant role of Î³Î´ T cells in the survival of leukemia patients. However, the heterogeneity of Î³Î´ T cells and their impact on clinical correlation in the peripheral blood of patients with DLBCL remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed on 9 blood samples, sourced from 6 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 3 healthy individuals (HIs), to delineate clinically pertinent Î³Î´ T cell states and subsets in DLBCL patients. Flow cytometry was then employed to validate the relationship between DLBCL prognosis and Î³Î´ T cell subsets. Our study integrated genetic drivers through consensus clustering, leading to the identification of 6 distinct Î³Î´ T cell subsets in DLBCL and HIs. These subsets include a naÃ¯ve Î³Î´ T cell subset characterized by TCF7 and LEF1 expression, a memory Î³Î´ T cell subset sharing common genes such as GZMK, IL7R, an anti-tumor Î³Î´ T cell subset with overexpression of IFNG, TNF, and CD69, and two subsets exhibiting TIGIT overexpression indicative of an exhausted Î³Î´ T cell phenotype. Additionally, a cytotoxic Î³Î´ T cell subset marked by increased NKG7 and GZMB levels was identified. Our results revealed that while Î³Î´ T cells possess anti-tumor capacities, their functional effectiveness is diminished due to differentiation into exhausted subpopulations. Several clusters with high cytotoxicity scores also showed elevated exhaustion scores (C13-Î³Î´-TIGIT.1, C14-Î³Î´-TIGIT.2), suggesting the presence of a population in DLBCL samples that is simultaneously exhausted and cytotoxic. In particular, the TIGIT.2 Î³Î´ T cell subset manifests a more pronounced exhaustion score relative to TIGIT.1 Î³Î´ T cell subset, indicating differential levels of cellular exhaustion among these groups. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between high expression of TIGIT Î³Î´ T cell subsets and poorer patient prognoses. We also discovered unique expression profiles within these subgroups: TIGIT.1 Î³Î´ T cells are marked by elevated CXCR4 expression, contrasting with the TIGIT.2 Î³Î´ T cell subgroup which exhibits increased CX3CR1 expression. Pseudotime analysis implies a potential differentiation trajectory from naÃ¯ve and GZMK Î³Î´ T cells to various terminally differentiated subsets, with genes associated with stemness (e.g., TCF-1) subsequently downregulated. These findings suggest that TIGIT.2 subset may be further along in the differentiation trajectory, potentially representing a more terminally differentiated state than TIGIT.1 subset. According to our clinical validation cohort, the TIGIT We identified genetic subtypes of Î³Î´ T cells with distinct genotypic and clinical characteristics in DLBCL patients.

{"text": "Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have prolonged survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however continuous administration increases toxicity.

With the CLL Society, we solicited volunteers with CLL who self-reported BTKi discontinuation for reasons other than CLL progression to participate in a web-based survey. In 170 patients, BTKi was discontinued for toxicity, because CLL was in remission, or personal choice in 62%, 14% and 8%, respectively. When asked how they felt about stopping the BTKi, most were relieved that they may eliminate toxicity (45%), could focus less on CLL (11%), and would not have to pay for the medicine (7%), while 29% experienced anxiety. A statistically significant increase in perceived quality of life (QOL) was observed from prior- versus post-BTKi discontinuation. Of patients who reported that they experienced clinical CLL progression (n = 80), 46% reported that these events did not happen for â¥ 1 year after BTKi discontinuation. Those that were on a BTKi for â¥ 2 years before discontinuation had more time without CLL relapse. These data provide a unique report of patient experiences.

{"text": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of commonly used antiseizure drugs-lacosamide (LCM), zonisamide (ZNS), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and clobazam (CLB)-on uterine implantation in a non-epileptic juvenile-to-adult rat model. Fifty female Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, ZNS (100 mg/kg/day), LCM (30 mg/kg/day), CLB (12.5 mg/kg/day), and OXC (100 mg/kg/day). Drugs were administered orally for 90 days. Mating was synchronized with estrous cycles, and implantation sites were assessed histologically using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), E-cadherin, and transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), quantified by H-score analysis. Expression levels of LIF, E-cadherin, and FOXO1 were significantly lower in all treatment groups compared to controls (p < 0.001). Tukey's post hoc analysis revealed significant differences in LIF and E-cadherin among most groups (p < 0.05). No significant differences in FOXO1 expression were observed between ZNS vs. CLB (p = 0.152) or ZNS vs. LCM (p = 0.070), while all other comparisons were significant (p < 0.05). The most pronounced reduction in implantation markers was found in the LCM group. These results suggest that long-term administration of ZNS, OXC, CLB, and LCM may impair implantation by altering key molecular markers.

{"text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding and internally derived small RNA molecules. They post-transcriptionally direct gene expression either by inhibiting translation or initiating degradation of mRNA. Conserved evolutionarily, these miRNAs have a significant role in several developmental and regulatory functions in organisms including mammalian cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. An individual miRNA can modulate a network of mRNA expression by binding to multiple mRNAs through imperfect sequence complementarity. In several types of cancer, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to cell initiation, migration, incursion, proliferation, immortality, and drug resistance. Among all leukemia cases, approximately 15 % of patients suffer from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). miRNA-based modulation offers the idiosyncratic competence for regulating a variety of genes simultaneously; in that way, it could help to modulate accordant signalling pathways that are engaged in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.

Here, we report on ratiometric codelivery of FLT3 and CDK4/6 dual inhibitors, gilteritinib and palbociclib, by daratumumab-decorated polymersomes (GIPA@DP) for high-efficacy targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). GIPA@DP showed synergistic anti-AML effects on MV-4-11 cells, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of ca. 2.6 ng/mL for each drug, which was further reduced to below 1 ng/mL by pretreating the cells with all-trans retinoic acid. GIPA@DP maintained an essentially constant GI/PA ratio in vivo and actively targeted AML cells at different leukemia sites. Selective AML-targeting in conjunction with ratiometric drug codelivery and synergistic anti-AML effects of GIPA@DP collectively led to significant survival benefits in CD38-upregulated MV-4-11 and Molm-13-Luc AML models, outperforming the nontargeted control (GIPA@P) and a mixture of two targeted single drug formulations (GI@DP + PA@DP).

Recent data brought serious concerns for the development of second primary malignancies (SPM), whether second myeloid neoplasms (SMN) or second non-hematological malignancies (SNHM), or T-cell cancers. Pertaining SPMs after CAR T-cell therapy, studies report an incidence ranging from 2.3% to 11.3% with a higher trend in patients 65 years of age or older, those with higher number of prior therapies, and with longer follow-up. In the case of SMNs, myelodysplastic syndrome is the most common ranging from 0.3% to 4.2%, followed by acute myeloid leukemia in 0.2% to 1.1% of cases. In SNHM, the incidence ranges from 0.6% to 11.6% and does not appear limited to a particular diagnosis or CAR T-cell product. Establishing a causal association between CAR T-cell therapy and development of T-cell malignancies is challenging. Notwithstanding the possibility of underreporting, the incidence of T-cell cancers after commercially approved CAR T-cell therapies ranges from 0.03% to 1%, occurring at 1 to 36 months post- infusion, with only a handful of reports confirming CAR transgene integration.

The probabilities of failure-free survival (FFS) were lower in patients with e19a2 and e1a2. Additionally, the probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS) were lower in patients with e19a2.

FLT3 inhibitor (FLT3i) maintenance therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has emerged as a promising strategy to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating FLT3i maintenance therapy versus standard of care (SOC) after allo-HCT in patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes included relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and FLT3i-related adverse events. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risks (RRs) were calculated using the \"meta\" package in R (version 4.4.0). Four RCTs including 701 patients (ages 18-78) met inclusion criteria. FLT3i maintenance significantly reduced relapse (HR 0.50; 95 % CI: 0.34-0.74) and mortality (HR 0.63; 95 % CI: 0.44-0.91) compared to SOC.

In our study, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing was performed to investigate four types of methylation modifications-6 mA, CHG, CHH, and CpG-in a pair of monozygotic twins, where one twin has ALL and the other is healthy. The results showed the significant global hypomethylation of CpG sites and an increase in 6 mA, CHG, and CHH methylation in the twin diagnosed with ALL. Notably, the hypomethylation of CpG was particularly increased in the open sea, gene body, and 3'UTR regions, while 6 mA and CHG modifications exhibited high methylation levels in the gene body, TSS1500, TSS200, and 3'UTR regions. Additionally, CHH modifications showed high methylation across all genomic regions.

A 56-year-old female presented to the hospital with a 10-day history of a perianal mass and hematochezia. Physical examination revealed a soft, flat abdomen with no palpable masses and normal bowel sounds. Imaging findings showed localized thickening of the distal rectum, diffuse mild thickening of the mid-to-upper rectal wall, and multiple small lymph nodes in the sigmoid mesocolon.Postoperative histopathological analysis, supported by immunohistochemical staining, confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic Miles surgery, followed by adjuvant abdominopelvic radiotherapy (GTVtb 50 Gy, CTV45 Gy) and targeted therapy with tislelizumab.

This single-center study involved SC patients from Yamagata University Hospital, enrolled between May 2017 and April 2020. For the healthy controls (HCs), our database comprising salivary metabolomics data of HCs was used. Whole unstimulated saliva samples were collected from patients with SC (n = 75) and HCs (n = 77). Paired tumor and control tissues after SC resection were obtained from the same patients who donated saliva. Hydrophilic metabolites in the tissue and saliva samples were comprehensively analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Using these candidate metabolites, a multiple logistic regression (MLR) model was developed to differentiate SC from HCs RESULTS: Sixty-six and 12 metabolites showed significant differences in tissues and saliva, respectively. Of these, six metabolites were commonly different between SC and HCs. Spermidine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and isoleucine were selected to develop the MLR model. The model exhibited a large area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.802, 95 % confidence interval: 0.731-0.874, P < 0.0001). Additionally, no significant differences were shown in candidate salivary metabolites between stages in both malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

While vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling has been identified as an immune checkpoint and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, its role in melanoma remains unexplored. This study investigated the impact of a novel VIP receptor antagonist, ANT308, on melanoma cell behavior and tumor growth. Using both murine and human UVM/cutaneous melanoma cell lines, we examined the inhibition of VIP receptor signaling and its effects on cell migration and proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, ANT308 downregulated melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) and N-cadherin expression at both the RNA and protein levels, as demonstrated by RNA sequencing and western blot analyses. Knockdown of the VIP receptor VPAC2 in mouse and human melanoma cells produced similar effects on cell migration, proliferation, and MCAM protein expression, further implicating VIP-VPAC2 signaling in tumor progression. In vivo studies revealed that ANT308 treatment decreased MCAM expression in intraocular primary tumors, reduced the number and size of liver metastases following intraocular or subcutaneous melanoma injection, and showed a trend toward reduced tumor volume at the primary tumor site. In conclusion, our findings indicate that VIP receptor signaling promotes liver metastasis in melanoma, and targeting this pathway with VIP receptor antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating metastatic UVM.", "entities": [{"entity": "UVEAL MELANOMA", "start": 1, "end": 14, "matched_text": "UVEAL MELANOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UVEAL MELANOMA", "start": 1, "end": 14, "matched_text": "UVEAL MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 134, "end": 138, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PEPTIDE", "start": 180, "end": 186, "matched_text": "PEPTIDE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VIP", "start": 189, "end": 191, "matched_text": "VIP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 194, "end": 202, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "start": 274, "end": 290, "matched_text": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "start": 274, "end": 290, "matched_text": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 297, "end": 300, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 305, "end": 312, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 305, "end": 312, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 425, "end": 428, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 425, "end": 428, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BEHAVIOR", "start": 430, "end": 437, "matched_text": "BEHAVIOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 443, "end": 447, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CUTANEOUS MELANOMA", "start": 489, "end": 506, "matched_text": "CUTANEOUS MELANOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CUTANEOUS MELANOMA", "start": 489, "end": 506, "matched_text": "CUTANEOUS MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL MIGRATION", "start": 592, "end": 605, "matched_text": "CELL MIGRATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA CELL ADHESION MOLECULE", "start": 673, "end": 703, "matched_text": "MELANOMA CELL ADHESION MOLECULE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MCAM", "start": 706, "end": 709, "matched_text": "MCAM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "N-CADHERIN", "start": 716, "end": 725, "matched_text": "N-CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 750, "end": 752, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 750, "end": 752, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 758, "end": 764, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 758, "end": 764, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 820, "end": 823, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}]}

While the preferred management for early-stage PMMV and PMMC is surgery, comprehensive reports on the impact of various surgical techniques on cancer outcomes are scarce. This study aimed to compare outcomes between open and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in PMMV and PMMC, and concurrently evaluated prognostic risk factors for these conditions. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of PMMV and PMMC patients treated surgically from January 2000 to July 2021. Clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes were assessed retrospectively. Patients underwent either open surgery or MIS. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rates were compared. Of 45 eligible patients, the MIS group showed a higher rate of total vaginectomy (P = 0.022), reduced median intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.031), shorter median hospital stay (P = 0.042), and no significant increase in perioperative complications (P = 0.867). The incidence of negative margins < 1 cm was significantly lower in the MIS group (P = 0.032). Cox proportional hazards regression identified microsatellites (HR = 2.893 [1.042-8.029]; P = 0.042), surgical negative margin distance (HR = 0.042 [0.008-0.217]; P < 0.001), and total vaginectomy (HR = 0.042 [0.008-0.217]; P < 0.001) as independent prognostic factors for DFS. MIS was linked to a significant difference in 2-year DFS (P = 0.030), but there was no notable difference in overall survival (OS) compared to open surgery (P = 0.078). The outcomes are validated through sensitivity analysis and hierarchical assessment, leading to the development of a novel nomogram simultaneously.

{"text": "Local anesthetics promote anticancer immune responses. A machine learning-based algorithm trained with information on the biological effects and molecular descriptors of analgesics, anesthetics, hypnotics and opioids predicted antitumor effects for dexmedetomidine (DEX). DEX is a sedative acting as an alpha2-adrenoceptor (ADRA2) agonist. Based on these premises, we investigated the putative antineoplastic effects of DEX. In vitro, DEX promoted premortem stresses such as autophagy and partial endoplasmic reticulum stress with the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha and the inhibition of the splicing of X-box binding protein 1. DEX elicited the biomarkers of immunogenic cell death, including the release of ATP and high-mobility group box 1 protein, and the cell surface exposure of calreticulin, enhancing the engulfment of malignant cells by dendritic cells. In immunocompetent mice, DEX decreased the progression of colorectal cancers, fibrosarcomas, mammary carcinomas and melanomas, as it improved overall survival. These effects were inhibited by the ADRA2 antagonist yohimbine, suggesting that DEX mediates its anticancer effects at least in part on-target. Depending on the specific tumor model, DEX also enhanced the cytotoxic T cell/regulatory T cell ratio in the tumor bed and draining lymph nodes. Programmed cell death protein 1 blockade tended to improve DEX effects. After rechallenge with antigenically identical cells, no tumor appeared, indicating the formation of immunological memory.

{"text": "Mast cells are tissue-resident immune cells present in connective tissues throughout the body. They exert diverse functions in immunity by rapidly releasing a plethora of preformed mediators, including proteoglycans, cytokines, and proteases, which are stored in cytoplasmic granules. Our aim was to systematically and globally identify mast cell-released protein mediators and elucidate their functions. We analysed the secretomes of antigen-activated primary mouse mast cells using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and conducted follow-up studies in vitro, ex vivo and using mast cell-specific genetic mouse models. We identified CSF1 as a novel preformed mast cell mediator present in the granules of all connective tissue-type mast cells. We further show that the mast cell secretome can induce macrophage differentiation and a unique polarisation pattern via CSF1 and other mediators. Mast cell-derived CSF1 has systemic functions, as mast cell-specific CSF1-deficient mice have lower serum CSF1 levels and reduced numbers of circulating monocytes.

{"text": "Mild photothermal therapy (mPTT) holds significant potential as a minimally invasive strategy for tumor ablation. However, its clinical translation remains constrained by the uneven intratumoral distribution of photothermal agents and the induction of autophagy pathways. These limitations frequently culminate in suboptimal therapeutic efficacy, facilitating immune evasion by residual tumor cells and thereby elevating the risk of recurrence and metastasis. Here, we report the development of nitric oxide-driven nanomotors (L-Arg-CaP@PDA-CQ) constructed by encapsulating L-arginine within calcium phosphate nanoparticles, functionalized with poly-dopamine shells and loaded with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. These self-propelled nanomotors demonstrated the ability to evade lysosomal phagocytosis, penetrate vascular barriers, and enhance intratumoral accumulation. Autophagy inhibition sensitized melanoma cells to mPTT, while the combination of chloroquine with mPTT induced reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial disruption. Furthermore, mPTT facilitated immunogenic cell death, and chloroquine-mediated inhibition of autophagosome degradation enhanced tumor antigen presentation, stimulating robust T-cell infiltration and immune activation. This dual mechanism significantly suppressed tumor recurrence and metastasis. The proposed nanomotors provide a synergistic paradigm for augmenting mPTT and activating antitumor immunity, highlighting their translational potential in clinical oncology. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mild photothermal therapy (mPTT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that operates at lower temperatures to minimize damage to healthy tissues while promoting antitumor immune responses. However, its efficacy can be limited by the activation of autophagy in tumor cells, which supports tumor survival. In addition, the hypoxic microenvironment of melanoma tumors often restricts drug penetration, further complicating treatment. To address these challenges, we have designed self-propelled smart nanomotors that can actively penetrate acidic tumor tissues and deliver drugs to the tumor site.These nanomotors modulate autophagy to enhance the sensitivity of melanoma cells to mPTT, leading to efficient tumor cell ablation.When combined with chloroquine, this approach generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species and causes mitochondrial damage, while promoting T-cell infiltration through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This strategy not only enhances the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT but also holds significant potential for clinical translation in the treatment of melanoma.", "entities": [{"entity": "MILD", "start": 1, "end": 4, "matched_text": "MILD", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 99, "end": 103, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TRANSLATION", "start": 137, "end": 147, "matched_text": "TRANSLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSLATION", "start": 137, "end": 147, "matched_text": "TRANSLATION", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AUTOPHAGY", "start": 253, "end": 261, "matched_text": "AUTOPHAGY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IMMUNE EVASION", "start": 361, "end": 374, "matched_text": "IMMUNE EVASION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ARG", "start": 530, "end": 532, "matched_text": "ARG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CAP", "start": 534, "end": 536, "matched_text": "CAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PDA", "start": 538, "end": 540, "matched_text": "PDA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "POLY", "start": 646, "end": 649, "matched_text": "POLY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PHAGOCYTOSIS", "start": 796, "end": 807, "matched_text": "PHAGOCYTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 910, "end": 917, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 910, "end": 917, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES GENERATION", "start": 989, "end": 1022, "matched_text": "REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES GENERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MITOCHONDRIAL", "start": 1028, "end": 1040, "matched_text": "MITOCHONDRIAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL DEATH", "start": 1096, "end": 1105, "matched_text": "CELL DEATH", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AUTOPHAGOSOME", "start": 1147, "end": 1159, "matched_text": "AUTOPHAGOSOME", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 1161, "end": 1171, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TUMOR ANTIGEN", "start": 1182, "end": 1194, "matched_text": "TUMOR ANTIGEN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ANTIGEN PRESENTATION", "start": 1188, "end": 1207, "matched_text": "ANTIGEN PRESENTATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1231, "end": 1234, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1231, "end": 1234, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 1600, "end": 1605, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1674, "end": 1679, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 1936, "end": 1939, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 2336, "end": 2340, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}]}

The patient presented with a 15-hour priapism requiring surgical intervention with a modified proximal shunt, followed by the development of tense bullae on the penile shaft 48 hours after the procedure. We propose that this atypical morphology and distribution reflects distinctive features of the vascular anatomy of the penis, where the glans and periurethral tissues receive redundant blood supply from the terminal branches of the internal pudendal artery, while the shaft skin depends on superficial vessels vulnerable to compression during elevated intracavernosal pressures. The 48-hour delay between intervention and vesiculation is consistent with ischemia-reperfusion injury, a mechanism involving oxidative damage and inflammation triggered by the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues.

We evaluated the usage of an mHealth app with various features, including pain tracking, quizzes for patient-facing guidelines, pain and asthma action plans, and goal setting. Adults with SCD were enrolled at 2 sickle cell centers between 2018 and 2022 as part of a 6-month feasibility randomized controlled trial with participants completing surveys at baseline and 6 months. Participants were randomized into receiving either an mHealth app and booklet with patient-facing guidelines or a booklet with the guidelines alone. The mHealth app comprised web pages with patient-facing guideline material and a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) project. The REDCap project included a personal profile, a pain tracker, goal setting, quizzes about the guidelines, and pain or asthma action plans. The REDCap project also included the ability to send daily text messages at a time they chose, which contained a message they could create and a link to their profile. Outcomes included SCD-specific knowledge and acute health care utilization (emergency room visits and hospitalizations). We evaluated the usage of these different features and relationships with baseline variables, each other, and study outcomes. Approximately 75% (50/67) of the enrolled and randomized participants completed all the study components, and 100% (26/26) of the participants who were randomized to the mHealth app arm and completed the study used the mHealth app. Further, 15/30 (50%) participants used multiple features. Baseline sickle cell knowledge and female gender were associated with more usage of pain diary (P=.04) and mission (P=.046) features, respectively. While not significant, mission completion was associated with lower hospitalizations (P=.06). Adults with SCD engaged differently with an mHealth app with multiple features. As this study was not focused on one part of our app, engagement with features in this app was entirely patient-driven, which may demonstrate the expected real-world use of an mHealth app in this population. A multipurpose app can help engage participants in self-management strategies through different features and potentially improve outcomes.", "entities": [{"entity": "APPS", "start": 31, "end": 34, "matched_text": "APPS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SICKLE CELL DISEASE", "start": 83, "end": 101, "matched_text": "SICKLE CELL DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SCD", "start": 104, "end": 106, "matched_text": "SCD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 151, "end": 157, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 159, "end": 165, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "APP", "start": 373, "end": 375, "matched_text": "APP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SET", "start": 403, "end": 405, "matched_text": "SET", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 633, "end": 636, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 633, "end": 636, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 633, "end": 636, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ASTHMA", "start": 696, "end": 701, "matched_text": "ASTHMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ASTHMA", "start": 696, "end": 701, "matched_text": "ASTHMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 777, "end": 780, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 777, "end": 780, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ARM", "start": 1955, "end": 1957, "matched_text": "ARM", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious inherited disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Zinc and magnesium are essential micronutrients involved in many cellular processes. Several studies have found that their deficiencies are common in SCD patients and may further complicate the disease. This study was conducted to examine plasma levels of zinc and magnesium in a group of SCD patients in Latakia. Methods A total of 85 SCD patients (52 males and 33 females) with both sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and hemoglobin sickle-beta-thalassemia (Hb S/Î²-Thal) genotypes at the steady state, and 30 healthy controls, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with no age limits. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were measured using colorimetric methods. Results Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls (P < 0.05). Twelve SCD patients (14.1%) were zinc-deficient, and 37 (43%) had magnesium deficiency. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were higher in HbSS patients than those with Hb S/Î²-Thal patients, but with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Notably, all zinc-deficient SCD patients were < 16 years old. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in zinc deficiency distribution between males and females. Age and gender had no significant statistical relations with magnesium deficiency in SCD patients (P > 0.05). Conclusion This study has shown that plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls, with no significant difference between HbSS and Hb S/Î²-Thal genotypes. Zinc and magnesium administration may be required in SCD patients from an early age, especially zinc, to mitigate the adverse effects of their deficiencies.", "entities": [{"entity": "SICKLE CELL DISEASE", "start": 12, "end": 30, "matched_text": "SICKLE CELL DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SCD", "start": 33, "end": 35, "matched_text": "SCD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 307, "end": 313, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PLASMA", "start": 352, "end": 357, "matched_text": "PLASMA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SICKLE CELL ANEMIA", "start": 498, "end": 515, "matched_text": "SICKLE CELL ANEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 546, "end": 549, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "THALASSEMIA", "start": 551, "end": 561, "matched_text": "THALASSEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "THAL", "start": 572, "end": 575, "matched_text": "THAL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY", "start": 958, "end": 977, "matched_text": "MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), focusing specifically on the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligand, HB-EGF. Cryptococcal meningitis, caused by C. neoformans, has a high mortality rate and poses a significant threat to global public health. Research indicates that C. neoformans employs various strategies to cross the BBB, with transcellular transport being particularly critical. We observed that C. neoformans infection significantly upregulates the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Silencing EGFR using siRNA technology resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of C. neoformans to traverse the BMEC monolayer. Furthermore, C. neoformans infection also upregulates EGFR ligands, such as HB-EGF, in BMECs, thereby activating the EGFR signaling pathway. This activation involves the engagement of ADAM family metalloproteinases and the metalloprotease Mpr1 from C. neoformans. The findings of this study underscore the critical role of the host EGFR signaling pathway in the ability of C. neoformans to cross the BBB and highlight potential targets for developing new therapies for infectious meningitis.", "entities": [{"entity": "AIMS", "start": 12, "end": 15, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 118, "end": 122, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 124, "end": 128, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 174, "end": 177, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR", "start": 186, "end": 217, "matched_text": "EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 220, "end": 223, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 220, "end": 223, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIGAND", "start": 234, "end": 239, "matched_text": "LIGAND", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EGF", "start": 245, "end": 247, "matched_text": "EGF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGF", "start": 245, "end": 247, "matched_text": "EGF", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS", "start": 250, "end": 272, "matched_text": "CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS", "start": 250, "end": 272, "matched_text": "CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TRANSPORT", "start": 484, "end": 492, "matched_text": "TRANSPORT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 609, "end": 623, "matched_text": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EGFR SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 932, "end": 953, "matched_text": "EGFR SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ADAM", "start": 999, "end": 1002, "matched_text": "ADAM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MPR1", "start": 1054, "end": 1057, "matched_text": "MPR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MENINGITIS", "start": 1295, "end": 1304, "matched_text": "MENINGITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MENINGITIS", "start": 1295, "end": 1304, "matched_text": "MENINGITIS", "type": "symptom"}]}

These data are especially underrepresented in the literature from eastern Europe and central Asia (EECA). This scoping review aimed to describe the peer-reviewed literature on cognitive health among PLWH in the EECA region. We selected articles from peer-reviewed journals that reported on cognitive assessments or the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive disorders among adult (â¥18 years) PLWH in EECA countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). Studies assessing cognition among PLWH related to traumatic brain injury, brain tumours, COVID-19, meningitis, neurosyphilis and/or other central nervous system infections were excluded. We searched for relevant data published up to March 2025 using four online databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO). Covidence, a web-based collaborative software platform, was used for data screening and extraction. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts, resolving disagreements through consensus. The data were extracted based on the predefined data extraction criteria. A total of 1388 peer-reviewed articles were identified; 295 articles were removed due to duplication; and 1053 and 25 articles were excluded based on the abstract/title and full-text screenings, respectively. Finally, 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. All 15 studies used different neuropsychological assessments to measure cognitive performance by domain and/or cognitive disorders among various subgroups of PLWH. One cross-sectional study focused on older populations (â¥40 years old), using standardised cognitive performance assessment tests. However, it neither provided information about the prevalence estimate of cognitive disorders nor identified risk factors. Existing literature on cognitive disorders among older PLWH in the EECA region is limited and insufficient to estimate prevalence, or identify risk factors, and ultimately develop appropriate policy addressing the needs of older PLWH in this region.

Here, we present a five-country, within-trial analysis exploring the household economic impact of cryptococcal meningitis. Eight hundred and ten participants were recruited into this sub-study in Botswana, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe between January 2018 and February 2021. We collected data on annual household expenditure, direct costs and indirect costs incurred prior to enrolment and during the 10-week trial period. Costs were inflated and converted to 2022 USD. We calculated out-of-pocket expenditure, lost income and catastrophic healthcare expenditure, defined as costs exceeding 20% of annual household expenditure. The average total out-of-pocket expenditure plus lost income prior to enrolment was $132 and 17.9% (145/810, 95% CI 15.3-20.5) of participant households had already experienced catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Among the 592 surviving participants, when combining out-of-pocket expenditure and lost income, the average cost was $516 and 29.1% of annual household expenditure across all countries, ranging from $230 (7.6%) in South Africa to $592 (64.2%) in Zimbabwe.

{"text": "COP28 Health Day demonstrated the growing global attention to climate health. The purpose of this article is to review the impact of climate change on the emergence of neuro-infectious diseases. Climate change influences meteorological shifts and extreme weather events which may have significant and complex effects on the emergence of neuroinfectious diseases. Particularly concerning is increasing vector borne, water borne and food borne diseases. Climate associated factors contribute to the high incidence of bacterial meningitis in the African Meningitis Belt, and expansion of viral and fungal meningitis in other regions.

{"text": "Chiari malformation is a congenital condition defined by anatomical abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction with downward displacement of cerebellar structures. While some cases are asymptomatic, others present with diverse clinical manifestations, including cerebellar dysfunction, brainstem compression, headaches, hydrocephalus, myelopathy, oropharyngeal dysfunction, sleep-related breathing disorders, scoliosis, and syringomyelia. Surgical intervention is the only treatment option for symptomatic patients, involving foramen magnum decompression (FMD) to decompress the craniovertebral junction and normalize cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Cervical laminectomy and duraplasty may be added depending on the severity of cerebellar tonsil herniation and brainstem compression. Complications of duraplasty include pseudomeningocele formation, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, acute postoperative hydrocephalus, and meningitis. We report a devastating case of a pediatric patient with Chiari malformation who developed cerebellar hemorrhage from a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) after FMD, resulting in death. A 16-year-old female was diagnosed with scoliosis, Chiari malformation, and syringomyelia at age 4. At age 15, due to the progression of scoliosis, corrective fusion surgery was planned, but surgical treatment for Chiari malformation was performed first. The surgery involved FMD, during which a well-developed occipital sinus was observed. When performing duraplasty in addition to FMD and upper cervical laminectomy, the occipital sinus was ligated to reduce bleeding risk. The postoperative course was uneventful with no obvious neurological deficits, and the patient was discharged home. The corrective fusion surgery for scoliosis was also successfully completed, and outpatient follow-up continued. One year and five months after the FMD surgery, the patient presented with a sudden headache and vomiting. Brain MRI revealed cerebellar hemorrhage and suspected dAVF to the occipital sinus. Cerebral angiography showed the occipital artery as the main feeder, the paramedian posterior marginal sinus as the shunt point, and the occipital sinus as the main drainer. Due to deep venous reflux indicating high risk of rebleeding, transarterial and transvenous embolization were performed. However, cerebral edema progressed, hydrocephalus worsened, and cerebellar hemorrhage recurred, resulting in the patient's death. When performing FMD in pediatric cases, thorough preoperative evaluation of venous sinuses is essential. Care should be taken to avoid ligation when a well-developed occipital sinus is observed. In such cases, consider limiting the procedure to bony decompression only.", "entities": [{"entity": "CHIARI MALFORMATION", "start": 1, "end": 19, "matched_text": "CHIARI MALFORMATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BRAINSTEM", "start": 290, "end": 298, "matched_text": "BRAINSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEADACHES", "start": 313, "end": 321, "matched_text": "HEADACHES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYDROCEPHALUS", "start": 324, "end": 336, "matched_text": "HYDROCEPHALUS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYDROCEPHALUS", "start": 324, "end": 336, "matched_text": "HYDROCEPHALUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYELOPATHY", "start": 339, "end": 348, "matched_text": "MYELOPATHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYELOPATHY", "start": 339, "end": 348, "matched_text": "MYELOPATHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS", "start": 378, "end": 410, "matched_text": "SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SCOLIOSIS", "start": 413, "end": 421, "matched_text": "SCOLIOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SCOLIOSIS", "start": 413, "end": 421, "matched_text": "SCOLIOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SYRINGOMYELIA", "start": 428, "end": 440, "matched_text": "SYRINGOMYELIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SYRINGOMYELIA", "start": 428, "end": 440, "matched_text": "SYRINGOMYELIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FORAMEN MAGNUM", "start": 530, "end": 543, "matched_text": "FORAMEN MAGNUM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FMD", "start": 560, "end": 562, "matched_text": "FMD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CEREBROSPINAL FLUID CIRCULATION", "start": 622, "end": 652, "matched_text": "CEREBROSPINAL FLUID CIRCULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SEVERITY", "start": 721, "end": 728, "matched_text": "SEVERITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TONSIL", "start": 744, "end": 749, "matched_text": "TONSIL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 843, "end": 851, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MENINGITIS", "start": 922, "end": 931, "matched_text": "MENINGITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MENINGITIS", "start": 922, "end": 931, "matched_text": "MENINGITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CEREBELLAR HEMORRHAGE", "start": 1025, "end": 1045, "matched_text": "CEREBELLAR HEMORRHAGE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA", "start": 1060, "end": 1080, "matched_text": "ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLEEDING", "start": 1581, "end": 1588, "matched_text": "BLEEDING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEADACHE", "start": 1909, "end": 1916, "matched_text": "HEADACHE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 1922, "end": 1929, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 1922, "end": 1929, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 1932, "end": 1936, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MRI", "start": 1938, "end": 1940, "matched_text": "MRI", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ARTERY", "start": 2058, "end": 2063, "matched_text": "ARTERY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 2072, "end": 2075, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CEREBRAL EDEMA", "start": 2320, "end": 2333, "matched_text": "CEREBRAL EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}]}

We extracted miRNAs from the exosomes of patients with AIP, chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic cancer, and healthy control individuals. To identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) associated with AIP, second-generation sequencing and differential expression analysis were performed. Target gene prediction, immune correlation analysis, functional annotation, and construction of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and transcription factor (TF)-miRNA-mRNA networks were then performed. Finally, qPCR analysis and ROC evaluation were performed for hub DEmiRNA. Exosomal miRNAs exhibited specific expression profiles in patients with type 1 AIP. The differentially expressed target genes PLXNA2 and PGM3, and the differentially expressed lncRNA MALAT1 associated with hsa-miR-30b-5p were identified. KEGG analysis showed that PLXNA2 was enriched in the axon guidance. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that PLXNA2 and PGM3 were significantly negatively correlated with activated CD4 T cells, type 1 T helper cells and other immune cells. The TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network showed that FOXA1 was a TF for PLXNA2 and PGM3, and RUNX2 was a TF for PLXNA2. Moreover, FOXA1 and RUNX2 were also the target genes of hsa-miR-30b-5p.

{"text": "Exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) demonstrate therapeutic potential against psoriasis, primarily due to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, the specific components within the exosomal cargo, particularly microRNAs, that mediate this activity remain unclear. This study investigated the role of a specific microRNA in mediating the therapeutic effects of exosomes from human placenta MSCs (MSC-exosomes) in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis murine model, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms, particularly the downstream pathways of the specific microRNA. Our small RNA sequencing analysis identified microRNA (miR)-100-5p as a potential target. Adult male Balb/c mice were then randomly assigned to the IMQ, IMQ plus MSC-exosomes (IMQ + Exo), IMQ plus MSC-exosomes treated with a specific miR-100-5p inhibitor (IMQ + Exoi), or IMQ plus agomiR-100-5p group (IMQ + AgomiR) (n = 6 per group). Control groups were also included. Mice were sacrificed, and psoriasis severity was assessed the day after 6 consecutive days of daily IMQ exposure, followed by 7 consecutive days of daily treatment. The IMQ + Exo group exhibited significantly lower epidermal thickness, levels of inflammatory cytokines and psoriasis-related cytokines (interleukin [IL]-12, IL-17, and IL-23), and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (the predicted downstream target of miR-100-5p), compared to the IMQ group (all p < 0.05). Notably, inhibition of miR-100-5p nullified these therapeutic effects of MSC-exosomes. This study provides evidence that miR-100-5p plays a crucial role in mediating the therapeutic effects of MSC-exosomes in an IMQ-induced murine psoriasis model, potentially by modulating the mTOR/S6K1 pathway.

The underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. This systematic review evaluates the prevalence and risk factors associated with renal abnormalities in SpA. A systematic literature search was conducted following the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data from 26 studies published between 1980 and 2025 were synthesized. Extracted variables included study author, year and location of publication, sample size, renal assessment parameters, prevalence of renal involvement, presence of control groups, and statistical significance of findings. Renal involvement in SpA, assessed through hematuria, proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and International Classification of Diseases codes, showed considerable variability, with prevalence ranging from 0.2 to 77.5%. Nephrolithiasis was also more common among SpA patients, with reported rates between 1.6% and 29.1%. Potential risk factors, including age, disease activity, comorbidities, and HLA-B27 status, were explored, though findings remained inconsistent. This review highlights significant methodological discrepancies among studies assessing renal involvement in SpA.

Furthermore, research conducted to date has not consistently excluded women with chronic hypertension and/or kidney disease prior to pregnancy, indicating a possible selection bias.

Here, we show that ADAMTS18/Adamts18 is significantly upregulated in the fibrotic kidneys of human CKD patients and mice. ADAMTS18 is primarily produced by renal tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts during RF. Functionally, Adamts18 deletion inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, and collagen synthesis. Conversely, Adamts18 overexpression exacerbates progressive renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, the KPFR sequence in ADAMTS18 disrupts the latency-associated peptide (LAP) interaction with TGF-Î² and increases the release of mature TGF-Î²1.

{"text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), with sudden cardiac death (SCD) constituting a primary cause of death, the molecular mechanisms of which are yet to be fully elucidated. Ubiquitin-specific protease 38 (USP38) has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in CKD-related ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is yet to be clarified. This research systematically explores the involvement of USP38 in the development of VAs in CKD. This study employed cardiac-specific Usp38 knockout and transgenic Usp38 mice, along with H9c2 cells transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying Usp38 (AdUsp38) or shRNA targeting Usp38 (AdshUsp38). The mouse model was generated via 5/6 nephrectomy, and CKD cell models were created using indoxyl sulfate (IS) induction. These models underwent extensive evaluation, including echocardiography, electrophysiology, histological studies, and molecular analysis. In CKD mouse models, USP38 expression was markedly elevated and predominantly localized in ventricular myocytes. Knocking out Usp38 markedly decreased the susceptibility and duration of rapid VAs in CKD mice and corrected the abnormal expression of ion channel proteins. Comparable findings were observed in Usp38 transgenic mouse models. From a mechanistic perspective, Usp38 knockout reduced oxidative stress in cardiac tissues and upregulated antioxidative enzyme expression. The enhancement was mainly achieved by increasing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) ubiquitination and degradation, along with inhibition of downstream CaMKII activity. In contrast, USP38 overexpression had harmful effects on the heart, which were alleviated by NOX4 inhibition. This study demonstrated that USP38 stabilizes NOX4 expression via deubiquitination, resulting in increased oxidative stress and hyperphosphorylation of CaMKII, which markedly enhances the susceptibility of CKD mice to VAs. These findings underscore the critical regulatory role of USP38 in CKD-related arrhythmias, providing a promising therapeutic target for USP38-directed treatments.", "entities": [{"entity": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 22, "matched_text": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 22, "matched_text": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH", "start": 36, "end": 55, "matched_text": "SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SCD", "start": 58, "end": 60, "matched_text": "SCD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 168, "end": 176, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 168, "end": 176, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "USP38", "start": 200, "end": 204, "matched_text": "USP38", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 303, "end": 306, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS", "start": 323, "end": 345, "matched_text": "VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VAS", "start": 348, "end": 350, "matched_text": "VAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 547, "end": 550, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 732, "end": 735, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 732, "end": 735, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LOCALIZED", "start": 1011, "end": 1019, "matched_text": "LOCALIZED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ION", "start": 1182, "end": 1184, "matched_text": "ION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1327, "end": 1342, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NADPH OXIDASE 4", "start": 1462, "end": 1476, "matched_text": "NADPH OXIDASE 4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NOX4", "start": 1479, "end": 1482, "matched_text": "NOX4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 1504, "end": 1514, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CAMKII", "start": 1553, "end": 1558, "matched_text": "CAMKII", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CAMKII", "start": 1553, "end": 1558, "matched_text": "CAMKII", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 1631, "end": 1635, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DEUBIQUITINATION", "start": 1746, "end": 1761, "matched_text": "DEUBIQUITINATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 1808, "end": 1827, "matched_text": "HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ARRHYTHMIAS", "start": 1982, "end": 1992, "matched_text": "ARRHYTHMIAS", "type": "symptom"}]}

Many small-sample, single-institution studies have looked at how patient factors can affect the risk of failure of these first-line treatments. Few have looked at a large, multi-institutional cohort to determine the significant risk factors. Patients who have chronic knee PJIs were identified in a de-identified records database. Failure after first-line treatment was defined as the need for further surgery, such as irrigation and debridement, re-revision, amputation, or arthrodesis, or the need for suppressive antibiotics. The five-year risk of failure was evaluated for individual patient factors in order to identify variables for a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Overall risk for the individual measures of failure, as well as 90-day mortality, was also reported. Over five years after first-line treatment, 27.8% of 2-stage revisions failed and 40.4% of 1-stage revisions failed. Treatment failure was seen more commonly in patients who had prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, a body mass index greater than or equal to 30, or a previous diagnosis of depression.

Using a modified American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 construct excluding dietary data, participants were categorized according to the number of ideal CVH score components they met. Participants who underwent follow-up health examinations between 2011 and 2014 (N=2,728,675) were additionally categorized by the combination of baseline and follow-up CVH scores. A composite of a cardiovascular or kidney event. Cardiovascular events included myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and death from CVD. Kidney event included incident chronic kidney disease, kidney replacement therapy, and death from kidney disease. Cause-specific proportional hazards model. During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 134,317 composite cardiovascular or kidney events occurred. Multivariable-adjusted risk of the event decreased stepwise with higher CVH scores (for a CVH score of 6 vs. 0: HR 0.32 [95% CI, 0.30-0.34]). An increase in CVH score from baseline (2009-2010) to follow-up (2011-2014) examination was associated with lower risk of an event (HR 0.86 [95% CI, 0.86-0.87] per +1 CVH score change). Moreover, the risk was lower in participants who maintained high CVH scores at both baseline and follow-up examinations than in those who newly achieved a high CVH score at follow-up examination (HR 0.87 [95% CI, 0.86-0.87] per +1 baseline CVH score).

This study investigates a novel screening approach utilizing pulse wave analysis combined with machine learning models to identify CKD patients at high risk for coronary atherosclerosis. We analyzed retrospective data from 124 CKD stage 5 patients who underwent kidney transplantation. Pulse wave signals were collected using SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia), and CAC scores were determined via CT scans. Machine learning models were developed using either pulse wave features or traditional risk factors (TRF) to detect high CAC scores (â¥100 Agatston units). The pulse wave-based model outperformed TRF-based model in identifying high CAC scores, particularly among younger patients. Specifically, the pulse wave-based classifier showed superior balanced accuracy in all analyzed age groups and superior sensitivity in patients under 60 years old, especially in those under 50 years old. The overall balanced accuracy of the pulse wave-based model exceeded 80 %, suggesting its potential as a reliable screening tool for detecting high risk of coronary atherosclerosis in CKD patients.

A total of 2,128 CBCT images were divided into training and validation and test datasets in a 7:1:1 ratio. For the verification of tooth recognition, the data from the validation set were randomly selected for analysis. Three groups of Mask R-CNN networks were compared: A scratch-trained baseline using randomly initialized weights (R group); A transfer learning approach with models pre-trained on COCO for object detection (C group); A variant pre-trained on ImageNetfor for object detection (I group). All configurations maintained identical hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. The deep learning model used ResNet-50 as the backbone network and was trained to 300epoch respectively. We assessed training loss, detection and training times, diagnostic accuracy, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and coverage precision to compare performance across the groups. Transfer learning significantly reduced training times compared to non-transfer learning approach (p < 0.05). The average detection time for group R was 0.269 Â± 0.176 s, whereas groups I (0.323 Â± 0.196 s) and C (0.346 Â± 0.195 s) exhibited significantly longer detection times (p < 0.05).

The questionnaire presented a scenario of an adult patient with high caries risk. Dentists were asked questions about the oral hygiene recommendations and preventive treatments they would provide to the patient. The responses regarding preventive treatments were structured according to an evidence-based guideline. The responses of general and specialist dentists were compared. Descriptive statistics were provided in terms of numbers and percentages. Cross-tabulations were created, and chi-square analyses were performed on the data. A total of 354 dentists responded to the survey, including 205 general dentists and 149 dental specialists. Dental specialists (82.6%) were more likely than general dentists (68.8%) to recommend fluoride-containing toothpaste (p < 0.05). Dental specialists (36.9%) applied fluoride varnish more frequently than general dentists (23.9%) (p < 0.05). On the other hand, general dentists (13.7%) recommended chlorhexidine more frequently than dental specialists (4.7%) (p < 0.05). Additionally, 15.5% of the dentists agreed that preventing caries in adults is not as effective as in children.

{"text": "Dental caries in childhood remains a major global public health issue. In response to persistently high caries levels among children, Chile implemented a national programme (Sembrando Sonrisas) including daily supervised toothbrushing and biannual fluoride varnish applications in nurseries. This study aimed to examine the association between these interventions and caries experience in preschool children, and to assess related socioeconomic inequalities. We analysed aggregated municipality-level data (n = 346) on dental caries outcomes in five-year-olds, coverage of fluoride varnish applications, delivery of toothbrushing materials (toothbrushes and 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste), exposure to community water fluoridation (CWF), rurality, and socioeconomic deprivation. The primary outcome was the caries experience of children covered by the programme since its national rollout in 2015. Univariate and multivariate weighted linear regression models assessed associations between programme interventions and caries experience, adjusting for deprivation and CWF. Socioeconomic inequalities in caries experience were evaluated using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). The distribution of programme delivery across socioeconomic deciles was assessed using weighted regression models. Data on 309,360 five-year-olds were included. Complete delivery of toothbrushing materials was associated with lower caries experience (50.1% vs. 55.0%), a 4.9% difference (95% CI: 2.5%, 7.2%) after adjustment. CWF exposure was associated with a 7.5% lower caries experience (95% CI: 4.2%, 10.9%). The combination of both interventions showed the lowest caries levels, with a 13.4% difference compared to areas with neither intervention (95% CI: 7.5%, 19.3%). Fluoride varnish application was not significantly associated with caries experience. Delivery of interventions was equitable across socioeconomic groups. However, caries experience was significantly higher in the most deprived municipalities (SII = 14.7%, 95% CI: 11.7%, 17.7%; RII = 0.283, p < 0.001). Lower caries experience was associated with supervised daily toothbrushing and CWF exposure, but not with fluoride varnish application. Despite equitable programme coverage, substantial socioeconomic inequalities persist.

{"text": "We know that ECC (Early Childhood Caries) has a multifactorial aetiology, in which dietary factors play a particularly significant role. Early childhood is a critical period during which exposure to various foods and flavours significantly shapes dietary preferences and future eating behaviours. Early dietary patterns can also influence bacterial ecology, including the colonisation of Streptococcus mutans, whose presence is a strong predictor of future caries incidence in young children. Early exposure to sugary foods and beverages can, therefore, have important consequences, laying the groundwork for future cariogenic dietary patterns or shaping acidogenic bacterial populations in the oral cavity. The American Heart Association recommends avoiding added sugars in food and beverages for children under two years of age. Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against introducing fruit juices before 12 months of age and recommends limiting their consumption to no more than four times per week for children aged one to three years. ECC also shares common risk factors with other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Therefore, strategies for the prevention of dental caries should aim not only at ensuring proper oral hygiene but also at promoting appropriate dietary habits from early childhood- namely, limited intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and refined foods. In this context, parents can and must play a crucial role by providing their children with healthier dietary choices and behaviours. We must thus consider early childhood caries as a condition whose origins-and solutions-lie within the family environment: children learn habits from those who care for them and control what, when, and how they eat. Changing a family's dietary habits is undoubtedly challenging, but we must recognise that interventions in ECC cases-especially early forms-necessarily require a family-centred approach. It is therefore essential to work in close collaboration with experienced nutritionists to collect data on dietary habits, identify unhealthy patterns, and design balanced, healthy diets for the entire family- supporting a virtuous path toward overall, not just oral, health.", "entities": [{"entity": "CARIES", "start": 35, "end": 40, "matched_text": "CARIES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 132, "end": 135, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EATING", "start": 279, "end": 284, "matched_text": "EATING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "STREPTOCOCCUS", "start": 389, "end": 401, "matched_text": "STREPTOCOCCUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ORAL CAVITY", "start": 696, "end": 706, "matched_text": "ORAL CAVITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 722, "end": 726, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "start": 1149, "end": 1170, "matched_text": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DIABETES", "start": 1173, "end": 1180, "matched_text": "DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 1187, "end": 1193, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 1187, "end": 1193, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DENTAL CARIES", "start": 1240, "end": 1252, "matched_text": "DENTAL CARIES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 1790, "end": 1792, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PATH", "start": 2223, "end": 2226, "matched_text": "PATH", "type": "protein"}]}

Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched from the commencement of the search to 22nd January 2024. Randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different caries preventive strategies in children with disabilities were included in the study. The risk of bias in the studies was determined by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I).

{"text": "Dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease resulting from the interplay of microbial, dietary, and host-related factors. In young children, the occurrence of severe caries (SC) is characterized by the presence of one or more decayed lesions in the primary teeth before the age of six. A particularly aggressive variant, known as early childhood caries (ECC), emerges during infancy and early childhood. ECC is recognized as a significant global health concern, impacting both industrialized and developing nations alike. It often presents at an early stage, advances swiftly-particularly in high-risk populations-and frequently remains untreated.Beyond its immediate dental implications, ECC adversely affects a child's overall health and well-being, with potential repercussions for their family. The condition is associated not only with pain, infection, and compromised oral function but also with broader systemic outcomes, including nutritional deficiencies and growth disturbances. Children with ECC are frequently reported to have lower body weight, impaired growth patterns, and a higher prevalence of anemia and malnutrition.Among the nutritional deficiencies linked to ECC, iron deficiency anemia-and specifically diminished serum ferritin levels-has drawn particular attention. Ferritin, as an indicator of iron stores in the body, plays a crucial role in growth and development, and its depletion can influence both systemic and oral health. Despite the widespread prevalence of both dental caries and iron deficiency across the globe, limited research has been conducted to determine whether a correlation exists between the two.Given this context, the present study aims to examine the potential association between serum ferritin levels and the presence of ECC in pediatric patients. Establishing such a relationship could provide valuable insights into the shared risk factors and possible integrated strategies for prevention and management. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO, Embase, Google Scholar, and other relevant platforms. The search strategy was designed to identify studies focusing on the relationship between ECC and iron status, particularly serum ferritin levels. Keywords and search terms included combinations such as \"early childhood caries,\" \"ECC and ferritin,\" and \"ECC and iron deficiency.\" Studies were included if they examined the association between ECC and serum ferritin or other indicators of iron deficiency. Both observational and interventional studies involving pediatric populations were considered, with no restrictions placed on geographical location or study design. Findings from the reviewed literature suggest a potential inverse relationship between ECC and serum ferritin levels, indicating that children with ECC may be at greater risk for iron deficiency. However, further investigations involving larger, well-defined sample populations are needed to draw more definitive conclusions and to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this association. Management of dental conditions, especially in young children, should extend beyond the oral cavity to consider the patient's overall health. The early pediatric age-group is particularly vulnerable, and dental professionals must recognize the importance of systemic factors-such as nutritional status and iron levels-in relation to oral disease. An integrated approach that includes routine screening for iron deficiency in children with ECC could contribute to more comprehensive care and better long-term health outcomes.

Mice were divided into five groups namely: control, NG-treated, NG + RA (20 mg/kg), NG + RA (40 mg/kg), and NG + sumatriptan.

{"text": "Triptans are efficacious, largely prescribed antimigraine drugs but where and how they exert their therapeutic effect is debated. Because of the presumed impermeability of the blood brain barrier to triptans, a peripheral antimigraine effect of these drugs have been repeatedly proposed. Recent findings, however, indicate that triptans cross the blood brain barrier, and counteract central nociception in models of pronociceptive sensitization. Here, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan in models of opioid withdrawal and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, two conditions sustained by deranged descending facilitation by the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). We found that s.c. sumatriptan injection in morphine-dependent rats 30 min before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal reduced severity of withdrawal symptoms. We also found that at the time of naloxone injection sumatriptan reached contents of 294Â±19 and 371Â±30 pg/mg of tissue in the RVM and locus coeruleus, respectively. In keeping with data on morphine withdrawal, s.c. sumatriptan injections suppressed thermal hyperalgesia in rats undergoing repeated dosing of morphine. Sumatriptan affected neither behavioral signs in morphine-dependent rats unexposed to naloxone, nor the extent of the initial antinociceptive response to morphine. Overall, data suggest that peripherally injected sumatriptan reaches CNS concentrations sufficient to exert functional neuromodulation of brainstem regions involved in pronociceptive sensitization and nociplasticity. PERSPECTIVE: This article reports that sumatriptan reduces symptoms of morphine withdrawal and morphine-induced hyperalgesia.

{"text": "BackgroundStructural imaging offers insight into migraine pathogenesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry plays a crucial role in identifying these alterations, yet the clinical significance remains debated. While gray matter volume and cortical curvature are commonly analyzed, cortical thickness offers a more direct measure of cytoarchitectural differences and neuroplastic changes in migraine. Advanced structural MRI techniques, including surface-based morphometry and voxel-based morphometry, have provided insights into cortical thickness alterations in migraine. These methods enable high-resolution assessment of brain morphometry, revealing dynamic changes associated with migraine phases and treatment.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes findings from cortical thickness studies, focusing on methodological approaches, variations in imaging sequences and study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.ResultsStudies using surface-based morphometry (i.e. SBM) and voxel-based morphometry (i.e. VBM) have reported inconsistent findings. Increased thickness is frequently observed in pain-processing regions, such as the somatosensory cortex, insula and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting hyperexcitability or maladaptive neuroplasticity. by contrast, cortical thinning has been noted in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and visual cortex, suggesting neuronal loss or impaired cortical integrity. Differences between episodic and chronic migraine further highlight progressive structural changes associated with disease burden. Emerging evidence also suggests that preventive treatments, including calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies and botulinum toxin A, may reverse some of these cortical alterations, particularly in treatment responders.ConclusionsCortical thickness analysis provides valuable insights into migraine pathophysiology, offering a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response. However, inconsistencies across studies highlight the need for standardized MRI protocols and larger longitudinal investigations to clarify the clinical relevance of cortical thickness changes in migraine.", "entities": [{"entity": "MIGRAINE", "start": 50, "end": 57, "matched_text": "MIGRAINE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MIGRAINE", "start": 50, "end": 57, "matched_text": "MIGRAINE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 59, "end": 70, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MRI", "start": 101, "end": 103, "matched_text": "MRI", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 134, "end": 137, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GRAY MATTER", "start": 226, "end": 236, "matched_text": "GRAY MATTER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 634, "end": 638, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SBM", "start": 1002, "end": 1004, "matched_text": "SBM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 1129, "end": 1132, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 1129, "end": 1132, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 1129, "end": 1132, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CORTEX", "start": 1180, "end": 1185, "matched_text": "CORTEX", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VISUAL CORTEX", "start": 1408, "end": 1420, "matched_text": "VISUAL CORTEX", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NEURONAL LOSS", "start": 1434, "end": 1446, "matched_text": "NEURONAL LOSS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EPISODIC", "start": 1500, "end": 1507, "matched_text": "EPISODIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 1513, "end": 1519, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROGRESSIVE", "start": 1548, "end": 1558, "matched_text": "PROGRESSIVE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 1595, "end": 1601, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 1620, "end": 1627, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1692, "end": 1695, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1692, "end": 1695, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PEPTIDE", "start": 1705, "end": 1711, "matched_text": "PEPTIDE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BOTULINUM TOXIN", "start": 1739, "end": 1753, "matched_text": "BOTULINUM TOXIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CLINICAL RELEVANCE", "start": 2163, "end": 2180, "matched_text": "CLINICAL RELEVANCE", "type": "symptom"}]}
{"text": "Migraine, a prevalent neurological disorder, is associated with dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular morbidity; however, the prognostic value of lipid biomarkers, particularly the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratio, remains inadequately explored. This study aims to explore the potential relationship between the TC/HDL-C ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with migraine and determine optimal thresholds for prognostic prediction. Data from the 1999â2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, encompassing 654 patients with migraine, were analyzed. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) was employed to delineate the dose-response relationship between the TC/HDL-C ratio and mortality risk. TC/HDL-C ratio was categorized into two groups based on thresholds derived from RCS and the maximally selected rank statistics method (MSRSM). Weighted multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess associations, adjusting for demographic variables, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were conducted to evaluate survival prognosis and prediction accuracy. Over a median follow-up of 16.33 years, 126 (19.27%) of the 654 patients died. RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between TC/HDL-C ratio and all-cause mortality. In the multivariable model, higher TC/HDL-C ratio (MSRSM-derived threshold of 5.15) were associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio = 2.986, 95% confidence interval = 1.495â5.967, This study reveals a nonlinear, U-shaped relationship between the TC/HDL-C ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with migraine, with higher TC/HDL-C ratio emerging as a robust, independent predictor of mortality.

This study analyzed migraine patients who underwent PFO closure at our institution from January 2020 through December 2022. Based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) findings, the patients were classified into two groups through two distinct classification approaches: method (A) permanent shunt (PS) group or non-PS group, and method (B) large shunt under Valsalva maneuver (LSVM) group or small to moderate shunt under Valsalva maneuver (SMSVM) group. Migraine improvement and adverse events after PFO closure were recorded. A total of 201 migraine patients were included in this study, 110 (54.7%) had PS and 118 (58.7%) had LSVM. The PS and LSVM groups experienced less migraine burden (57.1Â±64.5 vs. 88.5Â±96.5 hours, P=0.035; 59.7Â±67.3 vs. 88.9Â±96.6 hours, P=0.039).

{"text": "Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is characterized by seizures, as well as cognitive, memory, and behavioral disturbances. Blood-based biomarkers for inflammation and neuronal and glial injury have been evaluated as potential markers of disease severity and prognosis in AE. Patients diagnosed with LGI1 AE, confirmed by cell-based assay, were enrolled and followed prospectively to gather plasma samples for biomarker testing. Biomarkers of neuronal and glial injury included plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL-1), tau, and cytokine markers of inflammation. Biomarker data were logarithmically transformed and analyzed using longitudinal regression with the ratio of means between LGI1 AE and non-inflammatory controls. Clinical data were collected and correlated with blood-based biomarkers to assess their relationship to disease severity and long-term outcomes. Twenty-one LGI1 AE patients were enrolled from October 2018 to April 2024, and 16 migraine headache patients (56.3% male; average age: 58 years) served as non-inflammatory controls. One LGI1 AE patient in our cohort had a clinical relapse. Modified Rankin Score (mRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved over time. The mRS at symptom onset was 3.34 and dropped to 0.56 in a 5-year follow-up. Mean MoCA scores were 18.45 at the onset and increased to 29.40 in the 6-year follow-up. The model estimated geometric mean plasma NfL values at disease diagnosis to be 11.86 pg/mL; it was estimated to be 6.07 pg/mL when compared to non-inflammatory controls. The model also estimated the plasma GFAP values to be 77.70 pg/mL; it was estimated to be 36.26 pg/mL when compared to non-inflammatory controls. The trend of clinical improvement is paralleled with a slow decline in NfL and GFAP levels, returning to levels like our control population after 6 and 3 years, respectively. MoCA scores tended to recover more quickly in patients presenting with lower Nfl scores at symptom onset. Improved clinical symptoms were correlated with improvements in initially high NfL and GFAP levels. In one patient with a clinical relapse, NfL and GFAP levels increased. NfL and GFAP may be useful biomarkers of disease progression in patients with LGI1 AE.

{"text": "Background and aim Prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) are software-based medical treatments authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a range of chronic conditions. As clinical adoption increases, postmarket surveillance becomes essential to ensure safety beyond controlled trial environments. This study aimed to characterize postmarket adverse events and product problems associated with FDA-cleared PDTs using data from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. This approach supports the generation of hypothesis-forming safety signals in naturalistic care settings, where adherence patterns, off-label use, and user variability are more likely to emerge. Methods We conducted a retrospective, pharmacovigilance study of the MAUDE database through April 30, 2025. Device-specific product codes were used to identify reports related to 13 FDA-cleared PDTs as follows: reSET (Middletown, CT: PursueCare) for substance use disorder, reSET-O (Middletown, CT: PursueCare) for opioid use disorder, Somryst (Alpharetta, GA: Nox Health) and SleepioRx (San Francisco, CA: Big Health) for chronic insomnia, EndeavorRx (Boston, MA: Akili, Inc.) for pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parallel (San Francisco, CA: Mahana Therapeutics Inc.) and Regulora (Chicago, IL: metaMe Health) for irritable bowel syndrome, Stanza (San Francisco, CA: Swing Therapeutics, Inc.) for fibromyalgia, AspyreRx (New York City, NY: Click Therapeutics, Inc.) for type-2 diabetes, Rejoyn (Princeton, NJ: Otsuka Precision Health, Inc.) for major depressive disorder, DaylightRx (San Francisco, CA: Big Health) for generalized anxiety disorder, MamaLift Plus (Princeton, NJ: Curio Digital Therapeutics) for postpartum depression, and CT-132 (New York City, NY: Click Therapeutics, Inc.) for episodic migraine. Each report was manually reviewed for relevance and data extracted on event type, patient demographics, outcomes, and product details. Results Four reports were initially identified. Two were excluded after verification that they involved non-cleared or over-the-counter digital products. Of the remaining two, one report involved Somryst for insomnia prescribed to a patient with a seizure disorder, a known contraindication listed in its labeling, and resulted in disability. The other involved EndeavorRx, which reported perceived ineffectiveness without clinical harm. No adverse events were identified for the remaining 11 PDTs. Conclusions In this study, only two adverse event reports associated with FDA-cleared PDTs were identified in the MAUDE database. While this may suggest a favorable safety profile, the findings must be interpreted with caution given the limitations of passive surveillance systems, including underreporting, reporting bias, and limited capacity to capture software-specific harms. These preliminary results highlight the need for modernized, active safety monitoring frameworks tailored to the unique risks of digital therapeutics.", "entities": [{"entity": "DRUG", "start": 131, "end": 134, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FDA", "start": 152, "end": 154, "matched_text": "FDA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 172, "end": 178, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "APRIL", "start": 814, "end": 818, "matched_text": "APRIL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NOX", "start": 1083, "end": 1085, "matched_text": "NOX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SAN", "start": 1110, "end": 1112, "matched_text": "SAN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BIG", "start": 1129, "end": 1131, "matched_text": "BIG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INSOMNIA", "start": 1153, "end": 1160, "matched_text": "INSOMNIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INSOMNIA", "start": 1153, "end": 1160, "matched_text": "INSOMNIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERACTIVITY", "start": 1232, "end": 1244, "matched_text": "HYPERACTIVITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERACTIVITY", "start": 1232, "end": 1244, "matched_text": "HYPERACTIVITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ADHD", "start": 1256, "end": 1259, "matched_text": "ADHD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ADHD", "start": 1256, "end": 1259, "matched_text": "ADHD", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME", "start": 1364, "end": 1387, "matched_text": "IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FIBROMYALGIA", "start": 1447, "end": 1458, "matched_text": "FIBROMYALGIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIABETES", "start": 1527, "end": 1534, "matched_text": "DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER", "start": 1595, "end": 1619, "matched_text": "MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER", "start": 1669, "end": 1696, "matched_text": "GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION", "start": 1761, "end": 1781, "matched_text": "POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EPISODIC", "start": 1845, "end": 1852, "matched_text": "EPISODIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MIGRAINE", "start": 1854, "end": 1861, "matched_text": "MIGRAINE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MIGRAINE", "start": 1854, "end": 1861, "matched_text": "MIGRAINE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SEIZURE", "start": 2247, "end": 2253, "matched_text": "SEIZURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SEIZURE", "start": 2247, "end": 2253, "matched_text": "SEIZURE", "type": "disease"}]}

Ten key factors were identified in the analysis: four factors consistently acted as barriers (fatigue, sensory overload, symptoms, social expectations), four as facilitators (physical activity, assistive items, social support, health professional support), and two demonstrated a more complex, bidirectional influence (mental health, environment). These ten factors were organized to four overarching thematic groups: intrinsic factors, environmental and adaptive factors, social influences and symptom management. Adults with symptoms lasting greater than 10 days post-mild TBI report that a combination of symptoms, including fatigue and sensory overload prevent their ability to return to physical activity.

Participants underwent 6-11 days of outpatient or inpatient balneotherapy programs, with MSDs-related outcomes assessed at a six-month follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 28. Balneotherapy led to significant improvements in multiple parameters. Pain frequency and intensity decreased, with effect sizes ranging from small to large, accompanied by notable reductions in muscle spasms and tension. Spine mobility improved, pain medication use decreased, and hand strength increased following the 11-days medical spa treatment. Fatigue levels declined, while sleep quality and overall quality of life improved significantly, with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. Long-term benefits in muscle tension, spine mobility, fatigue, and quality of life were observed for up to six months.

{"text": "Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) and yoga postures require intentional, systematic, and repeated movements of the limbs. The study aim was to investigate the distinct hemodynamic responses that occur at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during yoga poses and PNF. Sixteen healthy young volunteers, aged 20-28 years, participated in two randomly assigned sessions, i.e., nine testing rounds of PNF stretching and yoga postures, conducted on two consecutive days. To ensure uniformity in the sessions, each volunteer underwent a 30-day orientation of both PNF stretching and yoga postures prior to the testing rounds. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record the blood flow responses of the right and left PFC at rest, during nine practice epochs, and after practice. Repeated measures analysis of variance with 2 Ã 2 Ã 3 (Sessions Ã right and left PFC Ã States respectively) was followed up with post-hoc analysis for oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). During PNF and yoga posture, there was significantly greater bilateral HbO in the prefrontal region of the brain. The results demonstrated improved PFC HbO from pre to during session (p < 0.05) in both PNF and yoga sessions. However, there was a more rapid change in HbR during the PNF sessions compared to yoga. The results suggest that yoga practice helps to maintain better oxygenation levels and may prevent rapid deoxygenation, which can indicate less fatigue or stress on the brain. In contrast, the rapid deoxygenation seen during PNF sessions could be associated with increased muscular effort and fatigue, leading to lower oxygen retention in the prefrontal cortex.", "entities": [{"entity": "PNF", "start": 44, "end": 46, "matched_text": "PNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORTEX", "start": 234, "end": 239, "matched_text": "CORTEX", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PFC", "start": 242, "end": 244, "matched_text": "PFC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 686, "end": 690, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "REST", "start": 736, "end": 739, "matched_text": "REST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REST", "start": 736, "end": 739, "matched_text": "REST", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 924, "end": 927, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OXYHEMOGLOBIN", "start": 946, "end": 958, "matched_text": "OXYHEMOGLOBIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEOXYHEMOGLOBIN", "start": 970, "end": 984, "matched_text": "DEOXYHEMOGLOBIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BILATERAL", "start": 1054, "end": 1062, "matched_text": "BILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 1100, "end": 1104, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HELPS", "start": 1345, "end": 1349, "matched_text": "HELPS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1450, "end": 1456, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1450, "end": 1456, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RETENTION", "start": 1632, "end": 1640, "matched_text": "RETENTION", "type": "gene"}]}

BLS matched CFOI and FARS data for 2011-2014. The matching algorithm used a series of iterative matches allowing for increasing levels of flexibility. Descriptive epidemiologic analysis was conducted to examine potential risk factors for MVCs. Crashes: Information on 3,822 fatal work-related MVCs was successfully matched. A collision (n = 3,156, 82.5%) was most often the first injury- or damage-producing event. Collisions with motor vehicles in transport accounted for 1,769 (46.5%) of crashes. Vehicles: The match identified 3,879 vehicles. Over half (53.6%) were large trucks. In most vehicles, one fatality (n = 3,657) occurred. Multiple worker fatalities per vehicle (n = 203) were more common in heavy trucks (n = 59, 29.1%) and pick-up trucks (n = 36, 17.7%).

There was little change in cough phase durations. Additionally, a pause in sequential airway stimulation (lasting several minutes) resulted in a further cough reduction, associated with prolongation of cough phase durations, but was resolved after one additional stimulus trial, consistent with long-latency transient depression. Power spectral analysis suggested changes in recruitment of motor units for parasternal muscles and no signs of fatigue although hundreds of coughs were executed.

In a randomized crossover design, fourteen active women performed four different inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW) protocols followed by maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and repeated inspiratory resistance breathing (RIRB) tests. Heart rate variability was also monitored before and after IMW. IMW techniques included deep inspiration with normal expiration (DI), deep inspiration with short breath-holding (DI-H), deep inspiration with short breath-holding followed by shallow breathing alternate (DI-H/SB), and deep inspiration and expiration (DI-DE). Each protocol was performed six breathing cycles per set for five sets, one-minute rest between sets. MVV and RIRB score were significantly increased by both protocols with breath-holding (MVV: p = 0.002, p =0.021; RIRB p = 0.002, p= 0.002, in DI-H and DI-H/SB, respectively). Deep inspiration alone did not affect both parameters. On the other hand, slow deep inspiration and deep expiration increased RIRB attempts (p = 0.020) without any effect on MVV value. Electrocardiogram indicated a significant decrease in RMSSD heart rate variability in deep inspiration with short breath-holding continuously (p = 0.043) and slow deep inspiration and deep expiration techniques (p = 0.032). However, a decrease was not observed in the technique of deep/shallow breathing alternate.

The theme \"Feeling hopeful and empowered by exercise in a socially supportive setting\" illustrated participants' overall experience. The theme was supported by the three categories: \"Exercise in a safe and encouraging context\", \"Feeling confident in living with MS-fatigue\", and \"Challenging to maintain exercise habits\", and seven subcategories. Participating in the HIRT trial was overall described as a positive and motivating experience. It provided a safe and encouraging environment. Most participants described reduced fatigue and an increase in their engagement in everyday life. Despite the overall positive perception of HIRT, participants encountered difficulties in sustaining their exercise routines over time. Peer support from both individuals with MS and physiotherapists with MS competence were important factors to enhance engagement in the HIRT programme. The group setting provided a supportive and encouraging environment. In addition, the training seemed to be a tool to alleviate fatigue and facilitate partaking in everyday activities for most participants. However, ongoing support to maintain exercise habits in the long term may be needed.", "entities": [{"entity": "MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS", "start": 13, "end": 30, "matched_text": "MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 61, "end": 67, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 61, "end": 67, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INTENSITY", "start": 75, "end": 83, "matched_text": "INTENSITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 1774, "end": 1777, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complication of open and endovascular thoracic (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Spinal fluid drainage (SFD) is used to reduce SCI risk in open surgery; however, many question the safety of SFD in endovascular repair. The objective of this retrospective study was to review the risks of prophylactic spinal fluid drainage in 1445 patients undergoing open and endovascular TAA and TAAA repair from 1987 to 2023. Spinal drains were placed in open TAAA repairs and endovascular repairs planning >12cm aortic coverage. Cardiac anesthesiologists placed and managed all drains. From 2000-2023 spinal drains for elective surgery were placed using fluoroscopic guidance. Spinal fluid was drained to <5-8 mmHg depending on SCI risk. If bloody fluid appeared, drainage was stopped and head CT obtained. Drainage was stopped when patient demonstrated normal leg strength; drains were removed at 48 hours if leg strength was normal. Post-SFD headache was treated with blood patch. We tracked intraoperative fluid drained, neurologic complications from SFD (any neurologic deficit from intracranial or spinal hematoma), bloody spinal fluid, intracranial blood on head CT without neurologic deficit, headache requiring blood patch, transient SCI (paraparesis/paraplegia), and permanent SCI (paraparesis/paraplegia). Of the 1445 patients (1029 open, 416 endovascular) undergoing TAA/TAAA repair, 1007 (777 open, 230 endovascular) had SFD. Before 2000, 263 open repairs done with smaller drains had an average of 125mls of fluid drained intraoperatively to achieve pressure goals. From 2000-2023 intraoperative SFD to achieve pressure goals averaged 132mls in open and 81mls in endovascular repairs. Six patients (0.6%) had neurologic complications from SFD; 5 of these (0.77%) occurred in open patients. Only 1 patient having endovascular repair had a neurologic complication from SFD (0.43%). From 2000-2023 other events not resulting in neurologic deficit included bloody spinal fluid (20.7% open; 21.7% endovascular); intracranial blood on CT without neurologic deficit (9.9% open; 6.1% endovascular); and headache requiring blood patch (7.6% open; 11.7% endovascular). From 2000-2023 5.6% of open patients had transient SCI; 4.2% had permanent SCI. 3.6% of endovascular patients had transient SCI; 1.2% had permanent SCI. Prophylactic SFD can be performed with acceptable risk in both endovascular and open TAAA repair.

{"text": "The study was planned when, the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was the only prophylactic agent approved by health authorities in several countries and no prophylactic COVID-19 vaccine was available. The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of Withania Somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS) as a chemoprophylactic and immunomodulatory agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a 12 week, randomized, open label, parallel group, two arm, comparative, multicentric, controlled trial compared WS with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in health care workers (HCWs). Total 400 HCWs were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either oral WS (500 mg for 12 weeks) or HCQ 400 mg (for 7 weeks). The primary outcome was to establish equivalence between WS and HCQ for the proportion of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven participants contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection: 5 in WS arm and 2 in HCQ arm. The equivalence between WS and HCQ was established for the proportion difference of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection for per-protocol (PP) (1.6%, 95% CI: -1.08%-4.33%) and in subgroup analysis (ITT, mIIT, non-vaccinated and seronegative). Notably, the immunomodulatory effect of WS stood scientifically validated by the statistically significant difference in cytokine levels (p < 0.0001) at 12 weeks compared to baseline for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were most frequent (53 in WS and 58 in HCQ). Headache and sneezing were observed only with HCQ. Participant global assessment showed excellent tolerability with both treatment arms. WS was found equivalent to HCQ as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 infection with no safety concern. WS is thus inferred to be an effective and safe Ayurvedic intervention for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also as an immunobooster.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID-19", "start": 162, "end": 169, "matched_text": "COVID-19", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ARM", "start": 415, "end": 417, "matched_text": "ARM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "start": 1316, "end": 1336, "matched_text": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "start": 1316, "end": 1336, "matched_text": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TNF", "start": 1339, "end": 1341, "matched_text": "TNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALPHA", "start": 1344, "end": 1348, "matched_text": "ALPHA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-10", "start": 1371, "end": 1375, "matched_text": "IL-10", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-10", "start": 1371, "end": 1375, "matched_text": "IL-10", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IL-17", "start": 1378, "end": 1382, "matched_text": "IL-17", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-17", "start": 1378, "end": 1382, "matched_text": "IL-17", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1413, "end": 1419, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1413, "end": 1419, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MCP-1", "start": 1424, "end": 1428, "matched_text": "MCP-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AES", "start": 1457, "end": 1459, "matched_text": "AES", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FREQUENT", "start": 1471, "end": 1478, "matched_text": "FREQUENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEADACHE", "start": 1506, "end": 1513, "matched_text": "HEADACHE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEADACHE", "start": 1506, "end": 1513, "matched_text": "HEADACHE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SNEEZING", "start": 1519, "end": 1526, "matched_text": "SNEEZING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ARMS", "start": 1637, "end": 1640, "matched_text": "ARMS", "type": "protein"}]}

Mice were divided into five groups namely: control, NG-treated, NG + RA (20 mg/kg), NG + RA (40 mg/kg), and NG + sumatriptan. It was observed that NG administration led to reduced pain thresholds, increased head-scratching, photosensitivity, elevated nitrite levels, oxidative stress, and upregulated neuroinflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-Î±, COX-2, CGRP). RA, particularly at 40 mg/kg, significantly reversed these effects by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing inflammation, and improving neuronal integrity.

{"text": "Pineal cysts are benign lesions found in 1-4% of the population. While surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms related to hydrocephalus or signs of tectal compression, most patients present with non-specific symptoms such as headaches, psychiatric disturbances, sleep dysregulation, dizziness, and fatigue, among others, where the role for surgery remains unclear. Although the etiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to these symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent pineal cyst resection at our center between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients presenting with hydrocephalus or concomitant conditions were excluded. Seven female patients (median age 27, range 19-42) were analyzed. The most common preoperative symptom was headaches, present in all patients, followed by fatigue, dizziness, memory problems, and psychiatric symptoms. Postoperatively, 85.7% (6/7) had complete headache resolution, while one (14.3%) had partial relief. Cognitive symptoms, including memory and concentration problems, improved in 66.6% (2/3) of cases, and psychiatric symptoms improved in 66% (4/6).

Patients with SIH often experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory changes, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral analgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require advanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with refractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks. This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved (STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from September 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative Bern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative management underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of 52.1 Â± 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches (92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications were Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved significant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in headache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale scores (P < .01).

The pattern of AEs was similar between pregnant (n = 2204) and nonpregnant (n = 2684) women, with the four most frequently reported AEs being: injection site reaction, myalgia, fatigue, and headache. Pregnant women reported less often at least one AE compared to nonpregnant women (65.9% vs. 72.3%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67-0.90), more than one AE, or specific AEs: nausea, chills, pyrexia, and arthralgia.

A cross-sectional survey was administered to final-year medical students from six universities located in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy between May and July 2024. The questionnaire (16 items) assessed the students' knowledge and attitudes toward acute pain management in pediatric patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. A total of 321 students completed the survey. The majority (49%) of students reported limited training (< 1 h) in pediatric pain management during their studies. Only 42% of respondents believed that neonates feel pain more intensively than adults, while 38% thought the same for children up to 3 years. old While 81% recognized that pediatric pain can be measured with age-specific tools, 60% would avoid using opioids for severe pain in children. Seventy-five percent of students reported routinely using analgesia before painful procedures, but 33% would not treat abdominal pain before surgical evaluation in a suspected appendicitis case.

{"text": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency that occurs when the ovary gets twisted on its supporting ligaments, which then cuts off the blood supply to the ovary, causing ischemia. This commonly leads to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Having a history of ovarian cysts can increase the risk of ovarian torsion. In this case report, we will discuss a 22-year-old woman with a history of bilateral ovarian cysts who was diagnosed with gangrenous ovarian torsion. This study will highlight the importance of treating ovarian torsion in a timely fashion in order to prevent undesirable complications, such as gangrene of the ovary, as seen in our patient's case. Gangrene and other necrotic processes can occur from ovarian torsion due to twisting of the ovary, thus causing a lack of blood supply, which is considered a gynecologic emergency.

{"text": "Internal hernias are a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, accounting for a small proportion of cases. Among these, paraduodenal hernias represent a significant subtype and require prompt recognition and intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no significant medical or surgical history who presented with a three-day history of generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Clinical examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory findings were unremarkable except for leukocytosis. Abdominal X-ray demonstrated features of small bowel obstruction, and CT imaging identified findings suggestive of a left paraduodenal hernia. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a large encapsulated peritoneal sac originating from the left paraduodenal region and extending into the pelvis. Dilated and edematous but viable small bowel loops were released, and adhesiolysis was performed. A planned second-look surgery two days later confirmed resolution of bowel edema, and the abdomen was closed without complications. Paraduodenal hernias arise from a congenital anomaly involving the mesentery and often present as intermittent or acute bowel obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms but can be facilitated by CT imaging.

{"text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral infectious disease caused by a novel Bandavirus in the family Phenuiviridae. The SFTS virus (SFTSV) is transmitted to various hosts, including humans, through tick bites, leading to high fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, with a high case fatality rate (up to 30%) due to multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing disease transmission. In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize monoclonal antibodies targeting the SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). We generated recombinant NP to screen antibodies against SFTSV. Using phage display technology, we identified candidate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences capable of detecting SFTSV NP. Five human IgG antibodies and six chimeric mouse antibodies exhibited strong binding ability to the recombinant NP. Furthermore, their specificity and selectivity were evaluated against NPs from different subtypes and other viral species. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine optimal antibody pairings for SFTSV detection. The mP01A05/hP01C09, mP01A05/hP01B10, and mP02E04/hP01A05 antibody pairs demonstrated high efficacy in diagnosing SFTSV infections. These findings provide valuable antibody resources and establish an effective platform for the diagnosis of SFTS.

The aim of this review was to highlight the current situation of leptospirosis in Africa and suggest a One Health approach of addressing its status as a leading zoonosis. In tropical regions, the nonspecific symptoms of fever, myalgia and arthralgia result in misdiagnosis of leptospirosis with malaria, yellow fever, typhoid fever, dengue fever, brucellosis, rickettsiosis, and babesiosis. Urinalysis presents an inexpensive diagnostic aid for leptospirosis. Humans with leptospirosis exhibit proteinuria, glucosuria, pyuria, haematuria and granular casts resulting from acute kidney injury. Therapeutic guidelines for empirical treatment of febrile patients should be considered. Febrile patients who test negative for malaria and yellow fever can benefit from doxycycline, which also treats brucellosis, rickettsiosis and typhoid fever. Control of leptospirosis should also address Leptospira infection in domestic animal reservoirs through vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs in endemic areas. Treatment of sick animals with streptomycin eliminates the carrier status, curbing leptospiruria and spread of infection. Rodents are important in transmission of Leptospira to humans in urban slums and rural settings therefore rodent control strategies help in reducing transmission of leptospirosis.

{"text": "Arboviruses pose a great threat to public health in sub-Saharan African countries. Mozambique is located in a region that is prone to climate change-related devastation, including heavy rainfalls and severe droughts that favor the emergence of zoonotic viruses transmitted by arthropods such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae, CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus riftense, RVFV). Both viruses are closely associated with livestock farming, including cattle, and can cause symptoms of hemorrhagic fever in humans. Available previous data sets related to the presence of RVFV and especially CCHFV in Mozambique are rather scarce. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the recent seroprevalence of both viruses in cattle in four localities of Limpopo National Park. In addition, ticks were collected and tested for the presence of different arboviruses. A total of 460 cattle blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of CCHFV and RVFV antibodies using ID Screen CCHF Double Antigen Multi-species (IgM/IgG) and ID Screen Rift Valley Fever Competition Multi-species commercial ELISA test kits (IDvet, Grabels, France), respectively. 1176 ticks were collected from the same animals and analyzed with different RT-qPCRs assays for CCHFV, Nairobi sheep disease virus (Orthonairovirus nairobiense, NSDV) virus and Dugbe virus (Orthonairovirus dugbeense, DUGV). Selected ticks were further screened by using a pan-Flavivirus melting curve PCR. The overall seroprevalence was higher for CCHFV (50%) compared to RVFV (28%). While a significant difference in seroprevalence between age groups was only found for CCHFV, there was a difference in RVFV seroprevalence between sampling sites that was not observed for CCHFV. None of the viruses tested were found inside the ticks.

In this cross-sectional study, adult cardiac arrhythmia outpatients from a tertiary care, academic medical center completed the 6-item PPAQ, the SF-12, a Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Included were patients with atrial fibrillation (82.4%), ventricular tachycardia (15.7%), and atrial tachycardia (2%). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, pairwise comparisons with Pearson correlations, Goodman Kruskal gamma statistic for ordinal associations, Cronbach's alpha, and Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) were used to determine concurrent construct validity and internal consistency reliability. Participants (n=51) had a mean age of 59.4 years (Â± 12.6), were majority male (66.7%) and Caucasian (75%). Preliminary evidence of concurrent construct validity was found based on moderate to strong correlations (range from 0.4 to 0.7) between the PPAQ and other validated measures, as well as strong internal reliability (KR-20 of 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.91). The most common symptoms reported were fatigue (60.8%) and heart fluttering (52.9%). Blurred vision (p<0.04), dizziness (p<0.01), and fatigue (p<0.04) were seen significantly more frequently in men compared to women. Results present additional evidence of the validity and reliability of the PPAQ. The PPAQ comprehensively measures the burden of the disease from cardiac arrhythmia patients' perspective. Validated, reliable, disease-specific PROMs are needed to direct personalized clinical decision-making.", "entities": [{"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 7, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "QUALITY", "start": 171, "end": 177, "matched_text": "QUALITY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ARRHYTHMIA", "start": 256, "end": 265, "matched_text": "ARRHYTHMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ARRHYTHMIA", "start": 256, "end": 265, "matched_text": "ARRHYTHMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROM", "start": 353, "end": 356, "matched_text": "PROM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA", "start": 376, "end": 403, "matched_text": "SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 554, "end": 561, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1026, "end": 1032, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1026, "end": 1032, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VAS", "start": 1055, "end": 1057, "matched_text": "VAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SYMPTOM", "start": 1071, "end": 1077, "matched_text": "SYMPTOM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ATRIAL FIBRILLATION", "start": 1170, "end": 1188, "matched_text": "ATRIAL FIBRILLATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ATRIAL FIBRILLATION", "start": 1170, "end": 1188, "matched_text": "ATRIAL FIBRILLATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA", "start": 1199, "end": 1221, "matched_text": "VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA", "start": 1199, "end": 1221, "matched_text": "VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TACHYCARDIA", "start": 1243, "end": 1253, "matched_text": "TACHYCARDIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TACHYCARDIA", "start": 1243, "end": 1253, "matched_text": "TACHYCARDIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ALPHA", "start": 1426, "end": 1430, "matched_text": "ALPHA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MODERATE", "start": 1737, "end": 1744, "matched_text": "MODERATE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 1984, "end": 1988, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 2010, "end": 2023, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 2010, "end": 2023, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIZZINESS", "start": 2035, "end": 2043, "matched_text": "DIZZINESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DIZZINESS", "start": 2035, "end": 2043, "matched_text": "DIZZINESS", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Pituitary apoplexy is a rare but potentially life-threatening endocrine emergency characterized by acute hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland. While often associated with pre-existing adenomas, it may also occur in previously normal glands. Risk factors include surgery, pregnancy, and medications such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which are rarely implicated in pituitary apoplexy. We present the case of a 59-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer who developed intractable headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and blurred vision shortly after receiving a leuprolide, GnRH agonist injection, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Brain imaging revealed a sellar and suprasellar pituitary tumor with hemorrhage. He was treated with intravenous fluids and steroids. The patient underwent emergent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy surgery, and pathology confirmed a gonadotroph adenoma with necrosis. The patient was discharged in stable condition. Pituitary apoplexy following GnRH agonist therapy is exceedingly rare, with fewer than 30 cases reported in the public domain. Proposed mechanisms include sudden cell shrinkage and metabolic hyperactivity within the pituitary gland. This case underscores the importance of recognizing the clinical presentation of pituitary apoplexy, as timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing severe neurological and endocrine sequelae. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for pituitary apoplexy in patients presenting with acute neurological or endocrine symptoms following GnRH agonist therapy.

{"text": "Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a sight-threatening condition primarily caused by herpesviruses, with adenoviral retinitis being exceedingly rare. We report a case of bilateral adenoviral vasculitis progressing to peripheral necrotizing retinitis in an immunocompromised patient with newly diagnosed HIV, emphasizing the role of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis and multimodal antiviral therapy. A 33-year-old male, recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 count: 158/ÂµL), presented with floaters and blurred vision. Fundus examination revealed bilateral peripheral occlusive vasculitis with blot hemorrhages and macular edema. Anterior chamber fluid analysis via PCR revealed a high viral load of human adenovirus (HAdV) and tested negative for other common viral causes of retinal necrosis. Initial treatment involved topical corticosteroids, intravitreal ganciclovir, and systemic valganciclovir. Due to disease progression, therapy was subsequently escalated to high-dose valacyclovir (2 g TID) with intravitreal ganciclovir and later intravenous cidofovir was introduced. Despite initial worsening, the addition of cidofovir resulted in gradual lesion resolution over 4 weeks, leaving peripheral retinal necrosis. The final best-corrected visual acuity improved to 6/6 (right eye) and 6/8 (left eye), with residual macular ischemia. Concurrent antiretroviral therapy led to immune reconstitution with an increase in CD4 counts to 580/ÂµL. Notably, a distinctive pattern of schisis-associated macular edema (SAME) was observed. Adenoviral necrotizing retinitis remains an underrecognized entity, particularly in immunocompromised patients. This case underscores the importance of PCR testing for HAdV in atypical necrotizing retinitis and highlights the need for a combined treatment approach, including systemic and intravitreal antiviral therapy.", "entities": [{"entity": "ACUTE RETINAL NECROSIS", "start": 1, "end": 22, "matched_text": "ACUTE RETINAL NECROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RETINITIS", "start": 114, "end": 122, "matched_text": "RETINITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RETINITIS", "start": 114, "end": 122, "matched_text": "RETINITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BILATERAL", "start": 168, "end": 176, "matched_text": "BILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VASCULITIS", "start": 189, "end": 198, "matched_text": "VASCULITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VASCULITIS", "start": 189, "end": 198, "matched_text": "VASCULITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PERIPHERAL", "start": 215, "end": 224, "matched_text": "PERIPHERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 322, "end": 325, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CD4", "start": 461, "end": 463, "matched_text": "CD4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 510, "end": 523, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 510, "end": 523, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 601, "end": 604, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MACULAR EDEMA", "start": 622, "end": 634, "matched_text": "MACULAR EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MACULAR EDEMA", "start": 622, "end": 634, "matched_text": "MACULAR EDEMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NECROSIS", "start": 792, "end": 799, "matched_text": "NECROSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NECROSIS", "start": 792, "end": 799, "matched_text": "NECROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TOPICAL", "start": 829, "end": 835, "matched_text": "TOPICAL", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 916, "end": 922, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 1290, "end": 1292, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 1290, "end": 1292, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ISCHEMIA", "start": 1337, "end": 1344, "matched_text": "ISCHEMIA", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Infectious uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, corresponding to the middle layer of the eye, triggered by a response against an infectious agent. This condition is classified into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. The most frequent infectious agents in anterior uveitis are viruses, mainly Herpes simplex virus, although it can also be caused by other pathogens such as Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Fusarium spp. In intermediate uveitis, syphilis plays a predominant role, while in posterior uveitis various microorganisms are involved, among them Toxoplasma gondii, Cytomegalovirus, Plasmodium spp. and Candida spp. In certain cases, as in ocular toxoplasmosis, severe inflammation may involve the entire uvea, resulting in panuveitis. Clinical manifestations of uveitis include ocular pain, redness, myodesopsias, blurred vision, and even loss of vision. Direct identification of the causative agent is complex, and the diagnostic performance of available tests varies significantly. For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on ocular specimens for Herpes simplex virus has a sensitivity of 91.3% and specificity of 98.8%, while for toxoplasmosis the sensitivity is 43.1% and specificity 98.5%. Another challenge in infectious uveitis is treatment, as systemic antimicrobials generally have a low penetration into ocular tissue, mostly less than 5%, mainly due to the blood-retinal and blood-aqueous barriers. The efficacy of the molecules in ocular tissue is favored by low protein binding and high liposolubility. This review addresses the most frequent clinical manifestations of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal etiologies of infectious uveitis, as well as the diagnostic performance of available tests.

{"text": "A 72-year-old male with hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and gout presented with painless blurred vision in the right eye, with intermittent ipsilateral headache for six months. Upon presentation, the right eye vision was 6/60 pinhole 6/36, with the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect. An anterior segment examination revealed right eye ciliary injection and corneal edema, with anterior chamber cells and fibrin. The right eye intraocular pressure (IOP) was 52 mmHg, and gonioscopy showed an open angle with rubeosis at the angle. The right eye fundus revealed a glaucomatous optic disc with a 0.7 cup-to-disc ratio, multiple dot-blot hemorrhages over the mid-peripheral retina, and narrowed retinal arteries suggesting ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). The left eye examination was unremarkable. The diagnosis was further confirmed by fundus fluorescein angiography, which showed a marked delay in arterio-venous transit time with a profound area of capillary fall-out at the peripheral retina. To tackle the ischemic component, a pan-retina photocoagulation laser was conducted. Topical and systemic antiglaucoma medications, topical steroids, and cycloplegics were commenced. He subsequently required a glaucoma drainage device in his right eye to control the IOP. He was investigated for the cause of OIS. Ultrasound carotid Doppler and computed tomography angiography of carotid arteries revealed bilateral internal carotid artery atherosclerotic disease with less than 50% stenosis.

{"text": "It remains unknown whether choroidal circulation could be altered at the onset of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) uveitis compared with that before ICI treatment. Herein we report a patient with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease-like uveitis in the unaffected eye as an immune-related adverse effect (irAE) due to ICIs for metastatic choroidal melanoma who had received enucleation. Moreover, choroidal circulation and choroidal thickness were measured before and after treatment. A 58-year-old man had a medical history of enucleation in his left eye due to choroidal melanoma 6 years ago. Metastatic lesions in the gastrointestinal tracts and lung were found, and then he received ICIs three times. About 1 month later, he suffered from blurred vision and metamorphopsia in his right eye. Choroidal circulation was evaluated by mean blur rate (MBR), a relative value showing choroidal blood velocity on laser speckle flowgraphy. Central choroidal thickness (CCT) was measured on optical coherence tomography. Since ophthalmic findings revealed VKH-like uveitis, oral prednisolone of 30 mg was given for 2 weeks, which were then tapered. MBR was reduced and CCT increased at the onset of ICI uveitis compared with its baseline and resolution after corticosteroid treatment. Choroidal circulation was disrupted, possibly due to ICI-induced autoinflammatory reaction to the choroid, which was managed by corticosteroid treatment. The combination of MBR and CCT could be a useful biomarker for managing the patients with VKH-like uveitis by ICIs.", "entities": [{"entity": "UVEITIS", "start": 117, "end": 123, "matched_text": "UVEITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UVEITIS", "start": 117, "end": 123, "matched_text": "UVEITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 225, "end": 231, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UNAFFECTED", "start": 253, "end": 262, "matched_text": "UNAFFECTED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 264, "end": 266, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EYE", "start": 264, "end": 266, "matched_text": "EYE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHOROIDAL MELANOMA", "start": 338, "end": 355, "matched_text": "CHOROIDAL MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ENUCLEATION", "start": 374, "end": 384, "matched_text": "ENUCLEATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AGO", "start": 590, "end": 592, "matched_text": "AGO", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 649, "end": 652, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 743, "end": 756, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 743, "end": 756, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "METAMORPHOPSIA", "start": 762, "end": 775, "matched_text": "METAMORPHOPSIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLUR", "start": 839, "end": 842, "matched_text": "BLUR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MBR", "start": 850, "end": 852, "matched_text": "MBR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 891, "end": 895, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 935, "end": 941, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CCT", "start": 964, "end": 966, "matched_text": "CCT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORTICOSTEROID", "start": 1253, "end": 1266, "matched_text": "CORTICOSTEROID", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "To describe the clinical features, multimodal imaging findings, natural history, and treatment outcomes of acute outer retinopathy (AOR), which represents an expanded spectrum of acute annular outer retinopathy (AAOR). Retrospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter case series. Twenty-three patients (15 female, 8 male) with a mean age of 41.8 Â± 18.6 years (range: 14-86 years) and a mean follow-up duration of 3.7 Â± 1.5 years (range: 1-12 years). Clinical characteristics, multimodal imaging findings, laboratory evaluations, genetic testing, natural history, therapeutic management, and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. Specific multimodal imaging signatures of AOR were identified, including findings from ophthalmoscopy, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Humphrey visual field testing, full-field electroretinography (ERG), and multifocal ERG were analyzed. Baseline features and the natural course of the disease were delineated. Thirty-eight eyes from 23 patients were analyzed. Presenting symptoms included photopsia (87%), blurred vision (57%), and scotoma (57%). On ophthalmoscopy, AOR was acutely characterized by yellow-greyish outer retinal lesions corresponding to hyperautofluorescent changes on FAF and the angular sign of Henle fiber layer hyperreflectivity (ASHH) on OCT. FAF imaging revealed ring-like hyperautofluorescent lesions surrounding the optic disc in 18% of eyes. Additional lesion patterns on FAF included perivenular (53%), sectoral (16%), and spot-like distributions (13%). FA and ICGA findings were mostly unremarkable. Lesion progression primarily occurred within the initial weeks following presentation and stabilized in size beyond this period in the majority of eyes. Over time, affected areas progressed to outer retinal atrophy with pigmentary changes. Foveal sparing was observed in 68% of the eyes. None of the therapeutic interventions appeared effective in halting the progression to complete outer retinal atrophy or preventing lesion enlargement. AOR is characterized by early photoreceptor disruption, evidenced by ASHH on OCT, leading to rapid outer retinal atrophy and subsequent degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium within the damaged zones. Although distinct patterns of lesion distribution were observed, their consistent features on multimodal imaging support their inclusion within a unified disease spectrum termed acute outer retinopathy.", "entities": [{"entity": "RETINOPATHY", "start": 120, "end": 130, "matched_text": "RETINOPATHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RETINOPATHY", "start": 120, "end": 130, "matched_text": "RETINOPATHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AOR", "start": 133, "end": 135, "matched_text": "AOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AOR", "start": 133, "end": 135, "matched_text": "AOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FAF", "start": 767, "end": 769, "matched_text": "FAF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OCT", "start": 875, "end": 877, "matched_text": "OCT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERG", "start": 944, "end": 946, "matched_text": "ERG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MULTIFOCAL", "start": 954, "end": 963, "matched_text": "MULTIFOCAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 1032, "end": 1038, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PHOTOPSIA", "start": 1136, "end": 1144, "matched_text": "PHOTOPSIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 1153, "end": 1166, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLURRED VISION", "start": 1153, "end": 1166, "matched_text": "BLURRED VISION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SCOTOMA", "start": 1179, "end": 1185, "matched_text": "SCOTOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SCOTOMA", "start": 1179, "end": 1185, "matched_text": "SCOTOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISC", "start": 1493, "end": 1496, "matched_text": "DISC", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SPOT", "start": 1596, "end": 1599, "matched_text": "SPOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AFFECTED", "start": 1838, "end": 1845, "matched_text": "AFFECTED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RETINAL ATROPHY", "start": 1873, "end": 1887, "matched_text": "RETINAL ATROPHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PIGMENTARY CHANGES", "start": 1894, "end": 1911, "matched_text": "PIGMENTARY CHANGES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIUM", "start": 2286, "end": 2295, "matched_text": "EPITHELIUM", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Uveitis is characterized by inflammation of the uvea-the middle portion of the eye composed of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid-causing eye redness, pain, photophobia, floaters, and blurred vision. Untreated uveitis may cause cataracts, glaucoma, macular edema, retinal detachment, optic nerve damage, and vision loss. Uveitis predominantly affects individuals aged 20 to 50 years. Anterior uveitis affects the iris and ciliary body (41%-60% of cases); intermediate uveitis affects the pars plana (attachment point of vitreous humor) and peripheral retina (9%-15%); posterior uveitis involves the choroid and/or retina (17%-23%); and panuveitis involves all uveal layers (7%-32%). Uveitis is classified as noninfectious or infectious, with toxoplasmosis, herpes, tuberculosis, and HIV comprising 11% to 21% of infectious cases in high-income countries and 50% in low- and middle-income countries. Incidence and prevalence of uveitis are influenced by genetic factors (eg, human leukocyte antigen-B27), environmental factors (eg, air pollution), and infection rates. In the US and Europe, 27% to 51% of uveitis cases are idiopathic, and 37% to 49% are associated with systemic disease, such as axial spondyloarthritis. Treatment goals are to induce and maintain remission while minimizing corticosteroid use to reduce corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Infectious uveitis requires systemic antimicrobial treatment. Active inflammatory disorders associated with uveitis should be treated by the appropriate specialist (eg, rheumatologist). Treatment for uveitis depends on subtype; anterior uveitis is treated with topical corticosteroids, and mild intermediate uveitis may be monitored without initial treatment. Patients with moderate to severe intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis are at high risk of sight-threatening complications and require systemic and/or intravitreal corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. For posterior uveitis, first-line therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate achieved remission of inflammation in 52.1% (95% CI, 38.6%-67.1%) of patients, and mycophenolate mofetil controlled inflammation in 70.9% (95% CI, 57.1%-83.5%). In patients who do not improve or worsen with first-line therapy, adalimumab extended time to treatment failure to 24 weeks vs 13 weeks with placebo and reduced frequency of treatment failure from 78.5% to 54.5% (P < .001). Uveitis is characterized by inflammation of the uvea and primarily affects adults aged 20 to 50 years. For noninfectious anterior uveitis, corticosteroid eyedrops are first-line treatment. For posterior noninfectious uveitis, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are first-line therapy; biologics such as adalimumab are second-line treatment for patients with inflammation refractory to treatment. Uveitis caused by systemic infection should be treated with antimicrobials, and local or systemic steroids may be used depending on the severity of uveitis and the specific microorganism.",

{"text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated stroke often shows scattered, multiple ischemic lesions, mostly located in the cerebral cortex or vertebrobasilar artery. PFO occlusion is recommended for patients with large right-to-left shunt signals (>4 mm), moderate to large right-to-left shunts, and multiple ischemic lesions on imaging examination if an embolic event is suspected. A 66-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with dizziness and blurred vision for 16 hours. No other symptoms or signs were observed. The transcranial doppler bubble test showed a rain curtain-like right-to-left shunt in a resting state, and ultrasound contrast indicated a right-to-left shunt at the level of the atria. MRI indicated a patient infarction site in the right temporal lobe and occipital cortex, and hemorrhage within the infarcted lesion. Surgery for PFO occlusion was performed on June 8, 2023.Two subcutaneous injections of low-molecular-weight heparin were administered postoperatively for anticoagulant therapy with 12-hour intervals between 2 shots, and aspirin and clopidogrel were administered for antiplatelet therapy. The patient's condition improved significantly after the operation. During the 3-month follow-up, postoperative cardiac ultrasonography showed that the shape and position of the occluders were normal, and no obvious shunt was found at the atrial level after PFO closure.

Current therapies, which focus on suppressing the immune system, mitigate the symptoms but are generally insufficient to address the disease. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) platform, initially developed as an attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), induces a potent T helper type 1 (Th1) polarized immune response, making it a promising candidate for treating Th2-dominant conditions, such as allergic asthma, ultimately alleviating the symptoms.

The occurrence, magnitude, phase durations, and power spectra characteristics of diaphragm and abdominal muscle electromyograms, and esophageal pressures during coughing were recorded during repeated mechanical stimulation of the trachea in cats. After the initial increase in cough excitability, repeated tracheal stimulation resulted in reduced cough number, electromyograms and esophageal pressure magnitudes, which fit an exponential model. There was little change in cough phase durations. Additionally, a pause in sequential airway stimulation (lasting several minutes) resulted in a further cough reduction, associated with prolongation of cough phase durations, but was resolved after one additional stimulus trial, consistent with long-latency transient depression. Power spectral analysis suggested changes in recruitment of motor units for parasternal muscles and no signs of fatigue although hundreds of coughs were executed. Our results are consistent with the presence of central adaptive mechanisms that can regulate the excitability of repetitive coughing, likely overlapping with transient potentiation and depression.

Symptoms (pain, fatigue, distress, cough, dyspnea, and sleepiness) were monitored three times daily from preoperative to postoperative day 6 using the Ecological Momentary Assessment. Step count was continuously monitored via a smartwatch. Short-term trends in symptoms and step count were analyzed. A hierarchical linear model was used to examine the immediate and lagged correlations between symptoms and step count, with confounders controlled. Symptoms and step counts showed fluctuation with a jagged changing trajectory. Step count decreased significantly when symptoms were worse than the individual average (P < 0.001), except for cough. Symptoms were significantly reduced when step count significantly increased (P < 0.001). Pain (Î² = - 73.384, P < 0.001) had a negative predictive effect on step count at the next moment, after controlling for step count.

{"text": "MUC5AC is an important component of mucins, which is often disproportionately increased in response to cigarette smoke and allergens, thereby increasing health problems. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Inula japonica Thunb. is used mainly to treat cough and phlegm. 1-O-Acetylbritannilactone (ABL), one of the main ingredients in I. japonica, may be an anti-inflammatory and anti-MUC5AC drug candidate. ABL significantly decreased the production of NO and the mRNA expression of IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, and iNOS in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Network pharmacology suggested that ABL might inhibit inflammation and MUC5AC expression, and EGFR, MAPK, SRC, and PKC-Î± might be key proteins involved. The results of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, CETSA and MST suggested that ABL interacted with PKC-Î±, indicating that PKC-Î± was a target of ABL. ABL reduced the expression of the SRC/EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway in PMA-induced NCI-H292 cells and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In animal experiments, ABL significantly ameliorated COPD in mice by improving pulmonary function, suppressing oxidative stress, and decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in lung tissue. The results of the phenol red test showed that ABL had a significant expectorant effect.

{"text": "Continuous cough monitors can greatly benefit doctors in home monitoring and treatment of respiratory diseases. Although many works propose algorithms to automate this task, they suffer of poor data privacy and short-term monitoring. Edge-AI is a promising paradigm to overcome these limitations by processing privacy-sensitive data close to their source. However, it presents challenges for the deployment of resource-demanding algorithms on constrained devices. In this work, we propose a hardware-aware methodology for developing a cough detection algorithm, analyzing design-time trade-offs for performance and energy. From audio and kinematic signals, our methodology aims at optimal features via Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), exploiting the explainability of the selected XGB model. Additionally, it analyzes the use of Mel spectrogram features, instead of the common MFCC. Moreover, a set of hyperparameters for a multimodal implementation of the classifier is explored. Finally, it evaluates the performance based on clinically relevant event-based metrics. The methodology proposes a novel structured approach to efficiently deploy AI on the edge, preserving data privacy. We apply our methodology to develop Cough-E, an energy-efficient, multimodal, and edge AI cough detector. It exploits audio and kinematic data in two distinct models, cooperating for a balanced energy and performance trade-off. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be executed in real-time on an ARM Cortex M33 microcontroller. Cough-E achieves a 70.56% energy saving compared to the audio-only approach, for a 1.26% relative performance drop, resulting in a 0.78 F1-score. Both Cough-E and the edge-aware model optimization methodology are available as open-source code.

{"text": "Allergic asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder driven by a T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated immune response that involves eosinophils and mast cell recruitment to affected tissues, eliciting inflammatory cytokines and IgE production. Typical symptoms in more severe cases include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, persistent coughing, excessive mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Current therapies, which focus on suppressing the immune system, mitigate the symptoms but are generally insufficient to address the disease. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) platform, initially developed as an attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), induces a potent T helper type 1 (Th1) polarized immune response, making it a promising candidate for treating Th2-dominant conditions, such as allergic asthma, ultimately alleviating the symptoms. BCG can be genetically modified to express antigens of other pathogens or immunogenic proteins, such as IL-12p70.

{"text": "To explore the dynamic changes and to identify core symptoms using network analysis in lung cancer survivors before, during, and after radiotherapy using a longitudinal approach. This study recruited 234 lung cancer survivors from a prospective and longitudinal study in a tertiary cancer hospital of China from January 2023 to October 2024. M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory of lung cancer module (MDASI-LC) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to measured physical and psychological symptoms at the time of pre-radiotherapy, the end of radiotherapy, and 4 weeks after radiotherapy, respectively. Network analysis was performed using R software version 4.3.2 to identify the core symptoms. A total of 234 lung cancer survivors are treated with radiotherapy; participants were included with an average age of 59.2 years, predominantly male (78.2%), representing various lung cancer subtypes and stages. Before radiotherapy, poor appetite was identified as the core symptom. At the end of radiotherapy, shortness of breath emerged as the central symptom, likely driven by radiation-induced respiratory complications. Four weeks after radiotherapy, fatigue became the most significant symptom. Psychological networks revealed depressive symptoms of lack of optimism as core before radiotherapy, panic as central at the end of treatment, and tension as predominant post-radiotherapy. This study highlights the dynamic evolution of core symptoms in lung cancer survivors undergoing radiotherapy. Findings underscore the importance of early interventions targeting appetite and psychological distress, as well as post-treatment strategies to address fatigue and emotional tension. Integrating physical and psychological care through symptom network analysis can guide personalized management approaches, improving patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. Integrating dynamic symptom management strategies that address evolving physical and psychological challenges, such as appetite, fatigue, and emotional tension, can significantly enhance quality of life and treatment outcomes for lung cancer survivors undergoing radiotherapy.", "entities": [{"entity": "CORE", "start": 48, "end": 51, "matched_text": "CORE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 88, "end": 98, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 88, "end": 98, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 283, "end": 288, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 283, "end": 288, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SYMPTOM", "start": 357, "end": 363, "matched_text": "SYMPTOM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ANXIETY", "start": 421, "end": 427, "matched_text": "ANXIETY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ANXIETY", "start": 421, "end": 427, "matched_text": "ANXIETY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DEPRESSION", "start": 433, "end": 442, "matched_text": "DEPRESSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DEPRESSION", "start": 433, "end": 442, "matched_text": "DEPRESSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "END", "start": 552, "end": 554, "matched_text": "END", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POOR APPETITE", "start": 945, "end": 957, "matched_text": "POOR APPETITE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "POOR APPETITE", "start": 945, "end": 957, "matched_text": "POOR APPETITE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "start": 1023, "end": 1041, "matched_text": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "start": 1023, "end": 1041, "matched_text": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 1058, "end": 1064, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1168, "end": 1174, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1168, "end": 1174, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LACK", "start": 1268, "end": 1271, "matched_text": "LACK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 1383, "end": 1386, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "QUALITY", "start": 1838, "end": 1844, "matched_text": "QUALITY", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare disease characterized by pulmonary hypertension (PH), resulting from stenosis or occlusion of the pulmonary arteries owing to an organic thrombus that obstructs blood flow in the pulmonary arteries. The prognosis for untreated patients is poor; however, it has improved significantly with the advent of treatments such as PH-targeted medical therapy and pulmonary balloon angioplasty, in addition to pulmonary endarterectomy. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying this disease remain unknown. Recently, a close association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and thrombosis has been detected, with the risk of venous thrombosis complications increasing after COVID-19 infection; however, few studies have reported on the association between COVID-19 and CTEPH. Herein, we present the case of a young man who developed CTEPH after a mild COVID-19 infection, despite the lack of an obvious thrombophilic predisposition. We conclude that if a patient develops chronic shortness of breath symptoms after a COVID-19 infection, it is important to investigate not only the COVID-19 sequelae, but also the presence of other diseases such as pulmonary artery thrombosis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection frequently causes abnormal blood coagulation and is closely related to thrombosis. Although pulmonary embolism is a frequent complication of venous thrombosis, few studies have reported an association between COVID-19 and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

{"text": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogenous genetic condition caused by myocyte disarray with varying degrees of interstitial fibrosis. Traditional management strategies focused on symptom mitigation and sudden cardiac death prevention among high-risk patients. The only disease-modifying treatments have historically been septal reduction therapy or heart transplantation. However, cardiac myosin inhibitors have emerged as promising novel pharmacotherapies. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac myosin inhibitors as well as surgical myectomy result in not only symptomatic benefit and reduction in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, but also positive cardiac remodeling including reduction in left ventricular mass and maximum wall thickness, improved left ventricular diastolic parameters, reduced left atrial volumes, and improved left atrial strain. The long-term durability and clinical significance of these findings require further study. In this article, we will review the existing evidence of favorable reverse remodeling conferred by cardiac myosin inhibitors and surgical myectomy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition resulting in thickening of the heart muscle and muscle stiffness which can cause symptoms varying from shortness of breath to sudden death. Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs when the thickened muscle causes blockage of the blood flow out of the heart. Treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has traditionally been used to minimize symptoms and conventional medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide do not significantly change the underlying disease process. A new class of medications called cardiac myosin inhibitors including mavacamten and aficamten have emerged which decrease symptoms and improve the obstruction. Surgical myectomy, in which a portion of the thickened muscle causing obstruction is surgically cut out, also improves symptoms and mortality. Recent evidence demonstrates that these cardiac myosin inhibitors as well as surgical myectomy may not only improve symptoms but also result in the heart undergoing physical changes that reverse some of the abnormalities associated with this condition. Future studies are needed to determine whether these physical changes result in improved patient outcomes.", "entities": [{"entity": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "start": 1, "end": 27, "matched_text": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "start": 1, "end": 27, "matched_text": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SYMPTOM", "start": 184, "end": 190, "matched_text": "SYMPTOM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH", "start": 207, "end": 226, "matched_text": "SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 274, "end": 280, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 354, "end": 358, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 472, "end": 479, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LEFT VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW TRACT OBSTRUCTION", "start": 607, "end": 648, "matched_text": "LEFT VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW TRACT OBSTRUCTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 880, "end": 883, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MUSCLE STIFFNESS", "start": 1213, "end": 1228, "matched_text": "MUSCLE STIFFNESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "start": 1268, "end": 1286, "matched_text": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "start": 1268, "end": 1286, "matched_text": "SHORTNESS OF BREATH", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SUDDEN DEATH", "start": 1291, "end": 1302, "matched_text": "SUDDEN DEATH", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 1401, "end": 1405, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 1571, "end": 1574, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROCESS", "start": 1680, "end": 1686, "matched_text": "PROCESS", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Most patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency medical services (EMS) setting are suspected of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Distinguishing true NSTE-ACS from non-cardiac chest pain based solely on the ECG is challenging. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for risk stratification of suspected NSTE-ACS patients and to compare its performance with currently available prehospital diagnostic tools. For this study, an internal training cohort and an external validation cohort were used, both consisting of suspected NSTE-ACS patients. A CNN (ECG interpretation by CNN (ECG-AI)) was trained and validated to detect NSTE-ACS. The diagnostic value of ECG-AI in detecting NSTE-ACS was compared with on-site ECG analyses by an EMS paramedic (ECG-EMS), point-of-care troponin assessment and a validated prehospital clinical risk score (prehospital History, ECG, Age, Risk factors and POC-troponin (preHEART)). A total of 5645 patients suspected of NSTE-ACS were included. In the external validation cohort (n=754), 27% were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS. ECG-AI had a better diagnostic performance than ECG-EMS (area under the curve (AUROC) 0.70 (0.66 to 0.74) vs AUROC 0.65 (0.61 to 0.70), p=0.045) for diagnosing NSTE-ACS. The overall diagnostic accuracy of preHEART was AUROC 0.78 (0.74 to 0.82) and superior compared with ECG-AI (p=0.001). Incorporating ECG-AI into preHEART led to a significant improvement in diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.83 (0.79 to 0.86), p<0.001). Correctly identifying patients who are at low risk for having NSTE-ACS is crucial for optimal triage in the prehospital setting. Recent studies have shown that these low-risk patients could potentially be left at home or transferred to a general practitioner, leading to less emergency department overcrowding and lower healthcare costs. Other studies demonstrated better overall diagnostic performance compared with our artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, these studies were aimed at a study population with a high prevalence of occlusive myocardial infarction, which could explain the differing levels of diagnostic performance.

Our cohort included 981 RA patients, 314 axSpA patients, 434 PsA patients and 34,783 non-IJD individuals experiencing a first MI. Chest pain was the most common symptom in all groups, and there was no indication that IJD subgroups experienced atypical presentations more often than non-IJD. Myocardial damage indicators - ST-elevation MI rates, troponin T levels and multi-vessel disease - were not worse in IJD patients. Acute treatments were equally, or more, often performed in IJD compared to non-IJD individuals. All in-hospital adverse events and short-term mortality were similar or less common in the IJD subgroups compared to non-IJD patients. None of the secondary cardio-preventive drugs were prescribed less frequently to IJD patients than to non-IJD.

{"text": "The Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a frequent cause of hand symptoms and activity limitations, which is associated with various personal risk factors. However, the association between these risk factors and CTS under conditions of cumulative exposure to the risk factors remains unclear. In this study, we utilized a cumulative risk score to assess the prevalence level of CTS , and further evaluated the interactions between different risk factors and their cumulative association with CTS. Specifically, we first conducted a univariate regression analysis to evaluate the independent association of risk factors with CTS. Then we ran the multivariate regression model to filter out significant risk factors from risk factors associated with CTS. Next, we constructed the risk score to represent the cumulative association of significant risk factors with CTS, and we analyzed the relationship between the risk score and the prevalence level of CTS. The experiment results demonstrated that among the various personal factors, sex, age, BMI, sleep disorder, smoking frequency, restlessness, diabetes, kidney failure, arthritis, and joint pain were the most significant factors related to CTS. There existed the cumulative association of risk factors with CTS, and the cumulative association of risk factors was positively related with an increased prevalence level of CTS. Moreover, there existed a critical threshold (risk score = 3) for the increase in the prevalence level of CTS. Our study reveals the significant risk factors among personal factors related with CTS, and presents the cumulative association of these risk factors with CTS. Moreover, we offer the actionable suggestions for CTS prevention based on the experiment results. The occurrence of CTS is associated with various risk factors. Identifying the independent and cumulative association of different risk factors is essential for designing effective preventive measures and interventions for CTS.

{"text": "Disease-specific patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are widely used to evaluate not only a patient's view of their symptoms, functional status, and health related quality of life, but also clinical benefit of treatments. The Patient Perspective of Arrhythmia Questionnaire (PPAQ) was initially developed as a self-administered, disease-specific PROM for patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) assessing the impact of the arrhythmia and symptoms on patients' daily activities and physical, emotional, and social functioning. Preliminary evidence of content and construct validity has been previously demonstrated, but only in SVT patients in the U.S. and Poland. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the concurrent validity of the PPAQ in patients having a variety of arrhythmias and to explore whether differences in symptoms existed by gender. In this cross-sectional study, adult cardiac arrhythmia outpatients from a tertiary care, academic medical center completed the 6-item PPAQ, the SF-12, a Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Included were patients with atrial fibrillation (82.4%), ventricular tachycardia (15.7%), and atrial tachycardia (2%). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, pairwise comparisons with Pearson correlations, Goodman Kruskal gamma statistic for ordinal associations, Cronbach's alpha, and Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) were used to determine concurrent construct validity and internal consistency reliability. Participants (n=51) had a mean age of 59.4 years (Â± 12.6), were majority male (66.7%) and Caucasian (75%). Preliminary evidence of concurrent construct validity was found based on moderate to strong correlations (range from 0.4 to 0.7) between the PPAQ and other validated measures, as well as strong internal reliability (KR-20 of 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.91). The most common symptoms reported were fatigue (60.8%) and heart fluttering (52.9%). Blurred vision (p<0.04), dizziness (p<0.01), and fatigue (p<0.04) were seen significantly more frequently in men compared to women. Results present additional evidence of the validity and reliability of the PPAQ. The PPAQ comprehensively measures the burden of the disease from cardiac arrhythmia patients' perspective.

While surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms related to hydrocephalus or signs of tectal compression, most patients present with non-specific symptoms such as headaches, psychiatric disturbances, sleep dysregulation, dizziness, and fatigue, among others, where the role for surgery remains unclear. Although the etiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to these symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent pineal cyst resection at our center between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients presenting with hydrocephalus or concomitant conditions were excluded. Seven female patients (median age 27, range 19-42) were analyzed. The most common preoperative symptom was headaches, present in all patients, followed by fatigue, dizziness, memory problems, and psychiatric symptoms. Postoperatively, 85.7% (6/7) had complete headache resolution, while one (14.3%) had partial relief. Cognitive symptoms, including memory and concentration problems, improved in 66.6% (2/3) of cases, and psychiatric symptoms improved in 66% (4/6). The median follow-up was 24 months, with no new neurological deficits at the final follow-up. Surgical resection can lead to significant improvements in non-specific symptoms including headaches, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive issues in a subset of pineal cyst patients with severe refractory symptoms.

Patients with SIH often experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory changes, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral analgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require advanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with refractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks. This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved (STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from September 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative Bern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative management underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of 52.1 Â± 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches (92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications were Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved significant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in headache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale scores (P < .01).

A systematic review of the literature was carried out, conducting a data search in the Pubmed/Medline, Science Direct and Embase databases. Initially, 1,223 articles were identified where, after detailed analysis, eight studies were selected to compose this research. The total sample comprised 703 patients. We observed a predominance of male participants in most studies, and the age range of those involved varied, on average, from 50.0 to 59.9 years old. The studies included cover a variety of pain management strategies after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, highlighting the diversity of approaches in the literature, including analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants and opioids. In general, we showed that the interventions used were well tolerated. Some studies have demonstrated mild adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache and other transient symptoms. This systematic review highlights that there is no well-established protocol for managing postoperative pain in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, comparing the effectiveness of different medications. The diversity of approaches observed in the literature highlights the need for personalized strategies.

PH is often asymptomatic, making detection and treatment difficult. Currently, there is no systematic approach to measuring and managing PH in UK general practice. To explore barriers and facilitators to improving PH measurement and management. Qualitative interview study with healthcare practitioners in general practices in England. We conducted individual, remote, semi-structured interviews with a range of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) who measure blood pressure (BP) in general practice, to explore their views and experiences of measuring and managing PH. Participants were identified from expressions of interest during a national survey. Interviews were video and audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. 26 HCPs in 24 practices across nine Clinical Research Networks in England were interviewed between March and July 2023. HCPs checked for PH when patients were older, reported dizziness, fatigue or had chronic conditions. Despite awareness of clinical guidelines, various diagnostic definitions were provided and measurement protocols varied between participants. Sit-to-stand rather than supine-to-stand measurements were considered more feasible due to time constraints and patient mobility.

The study involved 111 patients diagnosed with unilateral SSNHL, who underwent audiological evaluations and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, focusing on changes in FC related to their prognosis. Significant differences were found between the effective (n = 72) and ineffective (n = 39) treatment groups regarding the duration from onset to treatment and the presence of dizziness. Compared with effective group, the cohort with a poor prognosis demonstrated a significant increase in FC between the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the left hippocampus, right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and right precuneus.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of foliar spraying of silver and iron nanoparticles as fertilizers on yield, type, chemical compounds, and antimicrobial properties of M. officinalis leaf essential oil. For this purpose, plant cultivation was conducted in May 2020 as a completely random design. After one year of establishment, foliar spraying was conducted at the beginning of flowering, the peak of flowering, and the end of flowering at the levels of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L, and the control of iron and silver nanoparticles. After collecting and drying the leaves, the essential oil was extracted by water distillation, and the compounds were identified by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of essential oils was evaluated by using agar diffusion method, Minimum growth inhibitory concentration, and Minimum concentration of bacterial lethality. The results showed that foliar spraying with different nano iron and silver treatments had a significant effect on the yield, percentage of compounds, and antimicrobial activity of M. officinalis leaf essential oil (p â¤ 0.01). The 60 mg/L of FeNPs concentration with 1.70% (w/w) had the highest yield of M. officinalis leaf essential oil. The neral (33.5-0%), citral (28.53-0%), geranial (28.25-0%), caryophyllene (20.71-0%), caryophyllene-oxide (19.73-7.36%), and geranial acetate (5.99-11.84%) were the dominant compounds of essential oil. The results of antimicrobial test showed that the lowest MIC value belongs to the treatments of nano iron 100, nano silver 20, and nano silver 60 mg/L with a value of <62.5 Î¼g/mL. against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that it was one times weaker than rifampin and three times more potent than the control treatment. However, the best treatment in terms of of the essential oil efficiency was for the samples sprayed with nanoiron 60 mg/L. In terms of the essential oil componds, was for the nanoiron treatment 100 mg/L with the predominance of caryophyllene oxide and geranyl acetate, and in terms of the antimicrobial activity, was for the nano silver treatment, 60 mg/L.

{"text": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are major concerns for surgical patients. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia have been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are included in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, since total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive organs and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, do these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint arthroplasty surgery? This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data was collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 patients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed other short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse events (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included independent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared with the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we found that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a significant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI â¥ 30. Among secondary outcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved postoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital stay. Although the combination of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia did not show broad effectiveness in reducing PONV after TKA, it offered significant benefits for obese patients by reducing insulin resistance and decreasing PONV.

{"text": "Up to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to first-line treatment and among those who do respond, only about half achieve remission. For this reason, guidelines for treating depression mainly focus on how to proceed in cases of treatment failure or only partial response. The aim of this review paper is to present studies evaluating the effectiveness of vortioxetine in treatment of patients with depression following treatment failure with an SSRI/SNRI drug. Vortioxetine is an effective antidepressant that, after treatment failure with an SSRI/SNRI drug, allows 32-55% of patients to achieve remission. However, the assessed dosing regimen of vortioxetine deviated from that used in the initial therapy of depression, i.e. by the second week (8th day) of therapy the dose was increased to the maximum - 20 mg/day and the period for treatment effectiveness assessment was 8-12 weeks. This dosing regimen more closely resembles the pharmacological approach utilised in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder rather than depression. The administration of a high dose of vortioxetine did not negatively impact the tolerability of the treatment, even among patient groups at high risk of adverse events (elderly patients, co-existence of anxiety). The most common adverse effect was nausea; however, it was not observed that rapid dose escalation intensified this effect.

{"text": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare but debilitating condition caused by spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, resulting in low intracranial pressure. Patients with SIH often experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory changes, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral analgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require advanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with refractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks. This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved (STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from September 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative Bern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative management underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of 52.1 Â± 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches (92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications were Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved significant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in headache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale scores (P < .01).

What is this article about?Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer that causes abnormal blood cell production. A class of medications known as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can help treat symptoms, which include feeling tired and weak from too few red blood cells, as well as enlarged spleen. So far, four JAK inhibitors have been approved by the US FDA for treating myelofibrosis: ruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib, and momelotinib. However, these JAK inhibitors have different side effects, and clinical trials that directly compare these medications are not always available. We used a method known as indirect comparison to further understand differences in the side effects between momelotinib and pacritinib.What were the results?The findings show that momelotinib was associated with a lower risk of some side effects, including anemia, diarrhea, nausea, swelling from fluid buildup, and vomiting. The study also showed that momelotinib is more likely to increase the amount of hemoglobin, which is a measure of anemia improvement, compared with pacritinib.What do the results of the study mean?These results suggest that momelotinib may be a treatment option with fewer unwanted side effects for people with myelofibrosis.", "entities": [{"entity": "ANEMIA", "start": 59, "end": 64, "matched_text": "ANEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ANEMIA", "start": 59, "end": 64, "matched_text": "ANEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "JANUS KINASE", "start": 87, "end": 98, "matched_text": "JANUS KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "start": 161, "end": 173, "matched_text": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "start": 161, "end": 173, "matched_text": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AES", "start": 211, "end": 213, "matched_text": "AES", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 499, "end": 506, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 499, "end": 506, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NAUSEA", "start": 509, "end": 514, "matched_text": "NAUSEA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NAUSEA", "start": 509, "end": 514, "matched_text": "NAUSEA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PERIPHERAL EDEMA", "start": 517, "end": 532, "matched_text": "PERIPHERAL EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 539, "end": 546, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 539, "end": 546, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLOOD CANCER", "start": 909, "end": 920, "matched_text": "BLOOD CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOOD CANCER", "start": 909, "end": 920, "matched_text": "BLOOD CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLOOD CELL", "start": 943, "end": 952, "matched_text": "BLOOD CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TIRED", "start": 1075, "end": 1079, "matched_text": "TIRED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RED", "start": 1103, "end": 1105, "matched_text": "RED", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 1107, "end": 1111, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SPLEEN", "start": 1140, "end": 1145, "matched_text": "SPLEEN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FAR", "start": 1151, "end": 1153, "matched_text": "FAR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FDA", "start": 1205, "end": 1207, "matched_text": "FDA", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are major concerns for surgical patients. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia have been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are included in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, since total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive organs and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, do these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint arthroplasty surgery? This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data was collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 patients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed other short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse events (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included independent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared with the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we found that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a significant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI â¥ 30. Among secondary outcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved postoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital stay.

After PSM, the CS group had significantly worse short-term outcomes, with higher pain scores at 24, 48, and 72 h (P < 0.001), increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (P < 0.001), longer hospital stays (P < 0.001), greater cumulative opioid consumption (P < 0.001), higher rates of chronic postoperative pain (46.9% vs. 21.9%, P = 0.014), and greater patient dissatisfaction (25.0% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.039) compared to the non-CS group. This study found a 15.7% prevalence of CS among high-altitude TKA patients. Female gender, higher BMI, and residence at altitudes above 4,000 m were identified as factors associated with CS. Furthermore, CS was linked to worse short-term postoperative outcomes, including higher pain levels, increased incidence of PONV, greater opioid consumption, longer hospital stays, and a higher prevalence of chronic postoperative pain and dissatisfaction.", "entities": [{"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 1, "end": 7, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SENSITIZATION", "start": 9, "end": 21, "matched_text": "SENSITIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 45, "end": 48, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROLONGED", "start": 53, "end": 61, "matched_text": "PROLONGED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 63, "end": 66, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 63, "end": 66, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PAIN", "start": 63, "end": 66, "matched_text": "PAIN", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KNEE", "start": 98, "end": 101, "matched_text": "KNEE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 212, "end": 215, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 284, "end": 287, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS", "start": 453, "end": 471, "matched_text": "KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PSM", "start": 627, "end": 629, "matched_text": "PSM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC PAIN", "start": 845, "end": 856, "matched_text": "CHRONIC PAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC PAIN", "start": 845, "end": 856, "matched_text": "CHRONIC PAIN", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NAUSEA AND VOMITING", "start": 1461, "end": 1479, "matched_text": "NAUSEA AND VOMITING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 1603, "end": 1609, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}]}

The main objective of this study is to investigate whether post-pyloric feeding can improve the nutritional level of patients and reduce the incidence of feeding intolerance during the treatment of severe tetanus. A convenience sampling method was used to select 122 patients with tetanus who met the inclusion criteria from January 2020 to November 2023, and divided into groups that received Nasogastric feeding (NGF, n=36) and Nasointestinal feeding (NIF, n=36). Basic information was collected, nutritional biochemical indicators and frequency of intolerance were analyzed. By day 7 and 14, the NIF group exhibited significantly higher levels of Albumin (ALB), Total Protein (TP), Prealbumin (PA) and Retinol Binding Protein (RBP) compared to the NGF group. At the same time, the incidence of nutritional intolerance in the NIF group was significantly lower compared to the NGF group. Post-pyloric feeding can improve the nutritional level of patients with severe tetanus and reduce the frequency of feeding intolerance (diarrhea, abdominal distension and vomiting).", "entities": [{"entity": "TETANUS", "start": 22, "end": 28, "matched_text": "TETANUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TRISMUS", "start": 64, "end": 70, "matched_text": "TRISMUS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RIGIDITY", "start": 93, "end": 100, "matched_text": "RIGIDITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LIMB", "start": 212, "end": 215, "matched_text": "LIMB", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIMB", "start": 212, "end": 215, "matched_text": "LIMB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 230, "end": 233, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 285, "end": 288, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MET", "start": 519, "end": 521, "matched_text": "MET", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NGF", "start": 641, "end": 643, "matched_text": "NGF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NIF", "start": 680, "end": 682, "matched_text": "NIF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FREQUENCY", "start": 764, "end": 772, "matched_text": "FREQUENCY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ALBUMIN", "start": 876, "end": 882, "matched_text": "ALBUMIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALB", "start": 885, "end": 887, "matched_text": "ALB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 897, "end": 903, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 897, "end": 903, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PREALBUMIN", "start": 911, "end": 920, "matched_text": "PREALBUMIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RETINOL BINDING", "start": 931, "end": 945, "matched_text": "RETINOL BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RBP", "start": 956, "end": 958, "matched_text": "RBP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 1251, "end": 1258, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 1251, "end": 1258, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ABDOMINAL DISTENSION", "start": 1261, "end": 1280, "matched_text": "ABDOMINAL DISTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 1286, "end": 1293, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 1286, "end": 1293, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "symptom"}]}

{"text": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare but debilitating condition caused by spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, resulting in low intracranial pressure. Patients with SIH often experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory changes, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral analgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require advanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with refractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks. This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved (STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from September 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative Bern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative management underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of 52.1 Â± 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches (92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications were Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved significant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in headache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale scores (P < .01). Surgical repair is crucial for managing refractory SIH, with tailored techniques based on leak type and location.

{"text": "To perform an indirect treatment comparison of safety and anemia outcomes between the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors momelotinib and pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and anemia outcomes were compared in a pooled population of JAK inhibitor - experienced and - naive patients treated with momelotinib (SIMPLIFY-1/SIMPLIFY-2/MOMENTUM) or pacritinib (PERSIST-2/PAC203). Momelotinib had statistically significantly lower odds and risk for all grades of diarrhea, nausea, peripheral edema, and vomiting as well as grade 3/4 and serious AEs vs pacritinib. Momelotinib-treated patients also had greater odds/possibility of hemoglobin improvement of â¥ 1 g/dL and clinical improvement in hemoglobin. Momelotinib provides a more favorable safety profile and a higher chance for hemoglobin improvement vs pacritinib. What is this article about?Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer that causes abnormal blood cell production. A class of medications known as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can help treat symptoms, which include feeling tired and weak from too few red blood cells, as well as enlarged spleen. So far, four JAK inhibitors have been approved by the US FDA for treating myelofibrosis: ruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib, and momelotinib. However, these JAK inhibitors have different side effects, and clinical trials that directly compare these medications are not always available. We used a method known as indirect comparison to further understand differences in the side effects between momelotinib and pacritinib.What were the results?The findings show that momelotinib was associated with a lower risk of some side effects, including anemia, diarrhea, nausea, swelling from fluid buildup, and vomiting. The study also showed that momelotinib is more likely to increase the amount of hemoglobin, which is a measure of anemia improvement, compared with pacritinib.What do the results of the study mean?These results suggest that momelotinib may be a treatment option with fewer unwanted side effects for people with myelofibrosis.", "entities": [{"entity": "ANEMIA", "start": 59, "end": 64, "matched_text": "ANEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ANEMIA", "start": 59, "end": 64, "matched_text": "ANEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "JANUS KINASE", "start": 87, "end": 98, "matched_text": "JANUS KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "start": 161, "end": 173, "matched_text": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "start": 161, "end": 173, "matched_text": "MYELOFIBROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AES", "start": 211, "end": 213, "matched_text": "AES", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 499, "end": 506, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 499, "end": 506, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NAUSEA", "start": 509, "end": 514, "matched_text": "NAUSEA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NAUSEA", "start": 509, "end": 514, "matched_text": "NAUSEA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PERIPHERAL EDEMA", "start": 517, "end": 532, "matched_text": "PERIPHERAL EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 539, "end": 546, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VOMITING", "start": 539, "end": 546, "matched_text": "VOMITING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLOOD CANCER", "start": 909, "end": 920, "matched_text": "BLOOD CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOOD CANCER", "start": 909, "end": 920, "matched_text": "BLOOD CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLOOD CELL", "start": 943, "end": 952, "matched_text": "BLOOD CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TIRED", "start": 1075, "end": 1079, "matched_text": "TIRED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RED", "start": 1103, "end": 1105, "matched_text": "RED", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 1107, "end": 1111, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SPLEEN", "start": 1140, "end": 1145, "matched_text": "SPLEEN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FAR", "start": 1151, "end": 1153, "matched_text": "FAR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FDA", "start": 1205, "end": 1207, "matched_text": "FDA", "type": "protein"}]}

A quantitative analysis showed an inverse correlation between the SSL index and ketone levels (R = -0.361) and a positive correlation with glucose levels (R = 0.363). The SSL index indicated good diagnostic accuracy, with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of 0.76 for ketone levels and 0.73 for hypoglycemia.

Fecal material from 47 calves were collected, pooled, and sequenced using Illumina. Following sequencing, the virome composition and individual viral sequences were investigated using bioinformatic analysis. The metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of several RNA viruses, including rotavirus and bovine coronavirus, known causative agents in calf diarrhea. In addition, several enteric RNA viruses that have not been detected in cattle in Ethiopia previously, such as norovirus, nebovirus, astrovirus, torovirus, kobuvirus, enterovirus, boosepivirus and hunnivirus were identified. Furthermore, a highly divergent viral sequence, which we gave the working name suluvirus, was found. Suluvirus showed a similar genome structure to viruses within the Picornaviridae family and phylogenetic analysis showed that it clusters with crohiviruses. However, due to its very divergent amino acid sequence, we propose that suluvirus represent either a new genus within the Picornaviridae or a new species within crohiviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the RNA virome in Ethiopian cattle and the study revealed multiple RNA viruses circulating in both diarrheic and healthy calves, as well as a putative novel virus, suluvirus. Our study highlights that viral metagenomics is a powerful tool in understanding the divergence of viruses and their possible association to calf diarrhea, enabling characterization of known viruses as well as discovery of novel viruses.", "entities": [{"entity": "VIRUSES", "start": 1, "end": 7, "matched_text": "VIRUSES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VIRUSES", "start": 1, "end": 7, "matched_text": "VIRUSES", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 81, "end": 88, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIARRHEA", "start": 81, "end": 88, "matched_text": "DIARRHEA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 228, "end": 231, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 490, "end": 492, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 490, "end": 492, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 539, "end": 545, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FECAL MATERIAL", "start": 557, "end": 570, "matched_text": "FECAL MATERIAL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ENTEROVIRUS", "start": 1088, "end": 1098, "matched_text": "ENTEROVIRUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEQUENCE", "start": 1184, "end": 1191, "matched_text": "SEQUENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PICORNAVIRIDAE", "start": 1313, "end": 1326, "matched_text": "PICORNAVIRIDAE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AMINO ACID", "start": 1439, "end": 1448, "matched_text": "AMINO ACID", "type": "disease"}]}

{"text": "Porcine group A rotavirus (RVA) is a significant causative agent of diarrhea in piglets, leading to substantial economic losses in pig farms worldwide. While horizontal transmission of RVA among pig populations is well documented, the possibility of vertical transmission from sows to newborn piglets has not been definitively confirmed. In this study, piglet testicles, umbilical cord blood, and colostrum were collected from porcine RVA (PoRVA)-active farms for analysis. The samples presented high PoRVA-positive rates, with 70.00% in the testicle samples, 55.00% in the umbilical cord blood samples, and 73.33% in the colostrum samples. Immunohistochemical assays confirmed the presence of PoRVA in neonatal piglet testicles. Additionally, two PoRVA strains, RVA/Pig/CHN/QT/2023/G9P [23] (QT2023) and RVA/Pig/CHN/BH/2023/G12P [7] (BH2023), were isolated from newborn piglet testicles. Complete genome analyses revealed that strains QT2023 and BH2023 both presented a Wa-like backbone, with the genotype constellation of G9-P [23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G12-P [7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, respectively. While strains QT2023 and BH2023 originated from PoRVAs, sequence identities and phylogenetic analyses suggested close relationships with human rotaviruses in specific genes. Furthermore, successful viral replication of these strains in MA-104 cells was observed. Inoculation of PoRVA-negative piglets with strains QT2023 and BH2023 resulted in clinical diarrhea, fecal virus shedding, and intestinal pathological changes, highlighting the pathogenicity of these strains.

The subjects of the study were 150 organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, intestine, simultaneous pancreas and kidney [SPK]) who were at least two months post-transplantation. Stool samples were collected from each participant, and demographics along with clinical features were recorded. The stool samples underwent parasitological examination, including direct examination, zinc sulfate flotation, formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation, trichrome, and acid-fast staining to detect protozoan and helminthic infections. Samples positive for Blastocystis sp., as well as all diarrheal samples suspected of having microsporidia or intestinal coccidia, were further investigated using molecular methods. Sequencing was performed on the PCR products obtained from 10 Blastocystis samples. The resulting sequences were submitted to the Blastocystis 18 S database for GenBank sequence queries. The mean age of the participants was 46.24 (Â± 15.13), ranging from 18 to 85 years. Among the 150 subjects, 96 (64%) were male and 54 (36%) were female. The majority had undergone kidney transplantation (52.66%), followed by liver transplantation (46%).

At this data cutoff, median treatment duration with encorafenib plus binimetinib was 16.3 months in treatment-naÃ¯ve and 5.5 months in previously treated patients; minimum follow-up was approximately 32 and 22 months, respectively. In treatment-naÃ¯ve patients, the ORR was 75%, median DOR was 40.0 months, median PFS was 30.2 months, median OS was not estimable (NE; 95% CI: 31.3-NE), and the 3-year OS rate was 53%. In previously treated patients, the ORR was 46%, median DOR was 16.7 months, median PFS was 9.3 months, median OS was 22.7 months, and the 3-year OS rate was 29%. Overall, the most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (52%), diarrhea (44%), fatigue (33%), and vomiting (30%). TRAEs led to dose reductions and permanent treatment discontinuations in 25 (26%) and 16 (16%) patients, respectively.

Many approaches were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments; these approaches included body weight analysis, evaluations of short-term memory, biomarker assessments, histopathological examinations, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results suggest that agomelatine treatment effectively countered the weight loss associated with AD. Importantly, agomelatine enhanced cognitive performance, as indicated by improved short-term memory in spatial recognition assessments; mice treated with agomelatine showed spontaneous alternation percentages comparable to controls, with statistically significant differences observed between AD and control groups (Dunn's post-hoc p = 0.0072). Analyses of biomarkers showed that agomelatine reduced the AD-induced elevation of acetylcholinesterase activity, interleukin-6 levels, and oxidative stress markers while increasing total antioxidant capacity. Histopathological assessments showed enhanced structural integrity in hippocampal regions. FTIR spectroscopy revealed agomelatine's protective effect on brain molecular structure, mainly through preserving lipid order in the CH stretching region and preventing protein oxidation in the C = O spectral range, both of which are typically altered by AD pathology.

We found that LPS downregulates intercellular junction proteins and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines in intestinal epithelial cells. MenSCs reduced paracellular permeability and restored barrier integrity in Caco2 cells. In Vivo, MenSCs mitigated DSS-induced colitis in mice by reducing body weight loss, colonic shortening, and disease activity index scores and by inhibiting the expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î±. MenSCs increased the expression of TJ proteins, improved the destruction of tight junction (TJ) structures, and reduced intestinal epithelial permeability. Furthermore, MenSCs could inhibit NF-ÎºB p65 phosphorylation and the expression of Snail and prevent Snail nuclear localization, thereby maintaining tight and adherens junctions.

However, transhiatal sleeve migration (THSM) after LSG is currently considered an aggravating factor for postoperative weight regain and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thus, our aims in this study were to clarify the incidence of THSM after LSG and to evaluate the relationships between THSM parameters and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of THSM after LSG. We enrolled 107 patients with severe obesity who underwent LSG. We collected their clinical data at baseline and 1 year after LSG. All the patients were routinely examined with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and evaluated for GERD severity using the Los Angeles classification. They underwent a routine computed tomography examination, and the THSM length and volume were measured at a computer workstation. We then comprehensively analyzed the THSM parameters and clinical features of weight loss and GERD. The mean percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) in this cohort was 26.2%. The Los Angeles classification data, determined by EGD evaluation, indicated an increase in the number of patients with grades B and C GERD from 6 to 11 at 1 year after LSG, and THSM occurred in 16 patients (15.0%). Postoperative antacid administration rate also significantly increased (3.7% vs. 21.8%, p < 0.001). The mean THSM length and volume were 23.7 Â± 13.1 mm and 9.6 Â± 13.1 mL, respectively.

{"text": "Obesity presents a significant health risk for the aging population. Research shows that weight loss and regular exercise can greatly improve the functional status of older adults who are obese. However, weight loss may also result in a decrease in bone mass. To properly assess changes in fracture risk due to lifestyle interventions, a direct biomechanical evaluation of bone strength and fracture risk at metabolically active sites is essential. Computed tomography scans taken at two different time points of ten human volunteers provided the foundation for this study. A high-fidelity segmentation and modeling approach was taken to generate finite element models. Fracture risk before and after lifestyle intervention was compared using well-established hip and spine fracture models. In this study, two modeling techniques for generating finite element analyses were compared for their ability to detect minor changes in bone strength. An uncertainty analysis of methodologies indicated that a high-fidelity anatomically detailed modeling technique would be more sensitive than state-of-the-art voxel-based techniques to detect changes in bone strength and subsequent fracture risk due to lifestyle intervention.

{"text": "Brachioplasty is often performed in the post-bariatric patient. However, it implies long scars. Does the scar affect patient satisfaction? The aim of this study is to analyze long-term satisfaction of patients who underwent brachioplasty after massive weight loss. Patients meeting the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: no previous upper arm remodeling procedures, previous bariatric surgery followed by a weight loss of at least 30 kg, weight stability for at least 1 year, good understanding of the Italian language and standardized pre- and postoperative photographs. Preoperatively and at least 2 years after surgery, we administered the Italian version of the BODY-Q module and the SCAR-Q questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with particular focus on scars. We enrolled 11 males and 57 females aged between 25 and 65 years, with a mean follow-up of 24.4 months. We recorded significantly higher scores postoperatively compared to preoperatively in every BODY-Q and SCAR-Q scale administered (p < 0.001). Despite its scars, brachioplasty in the post-bariatric patient yields high satisfaction due to the possibility of remodeling the arm silhouette hence solving many daily problems caused by excess skin. When specifically investigating the scar, patients did not show any concerns with it. These results show that in post-bariatric patients, brachioplasty outcomes can be very satisfactory despite long scars. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

{"text": "The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a single session of in-person and remote strength training on the outcomes of low back pain, functional disability, and enjoyment in pregnant women. The methodology used was an approved controlled and randomized clinical trial by the Research Ethics Committee and registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry. The study involved seventeen pregnant women undergoing one in-person strength training session (IS), one remote strength training session (RS), and one control session (CS) in a randomly determined order. The team conducted assessments using questionnaires for low back pain, functional disability, and enjoyment. We compared the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) method with a Bonferroni complementary test (Î± = 0.05) and the Mann-Whitney U test. Reduced values of low back pain were found after the session for the SUM item in the in-person (Î-2.06), remote (Î-1.59), and control (Î-2.17) sessions, as well as for the INTENSITY item in the in-person (Î-0.23), remote (Î-0.12), and control (Î-0.3) sessions. Reductions in disability values 24 h after the session were observed for the remote (Î-0.76) and control (Î-1.59) sessions. Additionally, positive enjoyment values were noted after in-person (117) and remote (119) sessions. It is concluded that a strength training session can potentially improve or maintain the acute low back pain and disability scale without causing an increase in low back pain symptoms.

Prolonged posture while playing musical instruments may lead to musculoskeletal disorders. Although many scholars have studied the effects of playing posture on lumbar-pelvic kinematics, few have focused on marching band performance. This study assessed the influence of basic posture during marching band performance on lumbar-pelvic kinematics. The participants were healthy young adults without musculoskeletal injuries. Gait was measured under three conditions using a three-dimensional movement analysis system: normal gait, gait with a 1.15 kg trumpet, and marching band performance. An analysis of a single right gait cycle was used in this study to compare the spatiotemporal parameters and joint angles between conditions. The mean values of the thoracic posterior tilt angle, thoracolumbar transition, lumbar extension angle, and anterior pelvic tilt angle in forward marching were significantly higher than those in free walking and instrument-grasping gait (p < .05). The change in the thoracic and lumbar rotation angles in forward marching was significantly lower than those in free walking (p < .05). Forward marching may increase lumbar extension, heighten shear forces, and activate the erector spinae muscles. Restricted upper limb swing may hinder the coordination of the erector spinae muscles and impair trunk stability. Increased trunk/pelvic extension and decreased trunk rotation during forward marching may lead to overloading of the erector spinae muscle.

The study included 28 adults with low back pain and 43 control subjects. Each participant performed a 10-s standing task on the dominant limb for two trials using a stable platform with additional support from a touch of the contralateral foot.

Here we developed a novel selective EGFR C797S inhibitor, HS-10375, and report the results of pre-clinical research and the first-in-human phase 1 trial. Ba/F3 cell lines and patient-derived cells expressing mutant EGFR were used to test the selectively inhibitory potency of HS-10375 in vitro, and cell line-derived xenograft animal models were used to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of HS-10375 in vivo. In the phase 1 trial, HS-10375 was administered orally at six dose levels (10-240 mg) daily (QD) in 21-day cycles, following a rule-based, rolling six design. The primary objectives were the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The secondary objectives included PK parameters and anti-tumor activity. HS-10375 showed more potent activity in inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation compared to 1st to 3rd generation EGFR TKIs in C797S triple-mutant cell lines. HS-10375 also exhibited comparable inhibitory activity to 1st- and 2nd- generation EGFR TKIs and superior activity to 3rd-generation EGFR TKIs in C797S double-mutant cell lines. Furthermore, cells harboring EGFR double or triple C797S mutation underwent remarkable apoptosis upon HS-10375 treatment. HS-10375 effectively inhibited tumor growth in C797S triple-mutant mouse models. In the first-in-human trial, 28 patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancers who harbored EGFR mutation and who had experienced treatment failure with EGFR TKI treatment received at least one dose of HS-10375. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 2 patients at 240 mg QD, and MTD was reached at HS-10375 150 mg QD. The most common treatment-related adverse events were vomit (37.0%), loss of appetite (33.3%), and elevated AST (33.3%). One patient with EGFR mutations showed tumor shrinkage after progression on five-line treatment including gefitinib, almonertinib, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and EGFRxHER3 antibody-drug conjugate. HS-10375 demonstrated potent and mutant-selective activity against the EGFR C797S mutation in preclinical results, and showed an acceptable safety profile and objective response in a first-in-human phase 1 trial.

{"text": "Many neurological and psychiatric disorders involve dysregulation of subcortical structures. Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) is a novel, non-invasive method developed to selectively modulate these regions and associated neural circuits. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate human applications of tTIS (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024559678). MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov , and WHO ICTRP were searched up to December 12, 2024. Studies involving human applications of tTIS were eligible. Methodological quality was appraised using the NIH and modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine tools. Forty-eight records were reviewed (20 published studies, 28 ongoing trials). Of published studies, 16 single-session and 4 multi-session studies assessed safety, mechanistic outcomes, or therapeutic effects of tTIS in 820 participants. Stimulation was most commonly delivered at beta (20 Hz) or gamma (30-130 Hz) envelope frequencies. Neuroimaging studies supported target engagement of the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus in humans, particularly when stimulation was paired with behavioural tasks. Preliminary clinical findings in small samples demonstrated acute symptom improvements in bradykinesia and tremor within 60 minutes following a single tTIS session in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Reported adverse events across studies were mild (e.g., tingling, itching).

To examine how keloids and HTS affect quality of life (QoL) in darker-skinned populations and to evaluate treatment strategies that may improve both scar outcomes and QoL. We conducted a systematic review in April 2024 using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Two independent reviewers screened studies based on predetermined criteria, with a third resolving discrepancies. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scale From 132 initial publications, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. Surgical excision followed by brachytherapy showed recurrence rates of about 3.1% for keloids. Combining silicone gel sheeting, intralesional corticosteroids, laser therapy, and pressure therapy was generally more effective for HTS. While only a few studies included formal QoL assessments, improvements in pain, pruritus, and overall patient satisfaction were reported. Notably, darker Fitzpatrick skin types were underrepresented in existing scar severity scales, pointing to a gap in tailored outcome measures. Treatments such as surgical excision followed by brachytherapy appear promising for keloids, and multimodal approaches may yield better outcomes for HTS.

A total of 56 patients aged 18-65 years, classified as ASA physical status I-II, with a BMI of 18-30 kg.mÂ², were recruited from Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital between June 2023 and August 2024 for elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery. According to the random number table method, patients were randomly allocated into two groups: the improved subcostal border anterior quadrate block combined with general anesthesia group (Group A) and the traditional anterior quadrate block combined with general anesthesia group (Group B), each comprising 28 patients. Both groups underwent tracheal intubation and general anesthesia. Before anesthesia induction, patients in Group A received 0.33% ropivacaine (20 ml per side) administered bilaterally under ultrasound guidance for the improved anterior quadratus lumborum block. In contrast, patient in Group B received 0.33% ropivacaine (20 ml per side) administered bilaterally under ultrasound. Following the surgical procedure, both groups were administered controlled patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). The administration of perioperative opioids (including intraoperative remifentanil dosage and postoperative opioid dosage) as well as propofol was systematically recorded during the follow-up period; VAS scores were recorded both at dynamic and static at 2 hours, 6 hours,-24 hours, and 48 hours post-intervention; The number of effective analgesic pump activations within-48 hours post-operation was recorded. Additionally, the time of the first anal exhaust and the time of feeding within 48 hours after surgery were documented. Postoperative adverse reactions, including skin itching, nausea or vomiting, and dizziness, were also observed. Compared to Group B, Group A exhibited a significantly lower dosage of remifentanil (1.49 Â± 0.50 mg vs 1.86 Â± 0.77 mg, P<0.05) and postoperative opioids (median, 31.79 Î¼g with IQR 23.04-42.75Î¼g vs median, 42.30Î¼gwith IQR 43.26-44.64Î¼g), P<0.05); The dynamic and static VAS scores of patients in Group A were significantly reduced at 2 hours (median 3.00 with IQR 2.00-3.00 vs median 4.00 2with IQR 4.00-4.50, median 3.00 with IQR 2.00-3.00 vs median 3.00 with IQR 3.00-4.00, P<0.001), 6 hours (median 3.00 with IQR 2.00-3.50 vs median 4.00 with IQR 4.00-4.50, median 2.00 with IQR 2.00-3.00 vs median 3.50 with IQR 3.00-4.00, P<0.001) and 24 hours (median 3.00 with IQR 3.00-4.00 vs median 4.00 with IQR 3.50, 4.50, median 3.00 with IQR2.00-3.00 vs median 3.00 with IQR 3.00-4.00, P<0.05); There was no statistically significant difference in dynamic and static VAS scores between the two groups at 48 hours (P=0.568, P = 0.109); The number of analgesic pump compressions in Group A significantly decreased at 48 hours post-surgery (median,0.00 with IQR 1.00-2.00) vs median,1.50 with IQR 0.25-4.00, P<0.05).

{"text": "Due to the clinical heterogeneity of unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, its prognosis is difficult to predict. This study aims to establish a system that could incorporate multiple factors for better prediction of the prognosis. Seven hundred eighty-four adult patients with unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss who were hospitalised for treatment between Jan 2016 and Dec 2020 were included. Pure tone audiometry hearing threshold calculated by the average value of hearing thresholds at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz was used for evaluating treatment efficacy. The final cure rate was 31.0% (232/748). Age, onset-therapy time, initial hearing level, audiogram shape, and vertigo were found to be independently predictive for the prognosis. A scoring system that could incorporate all these five factors based on their prediction weights was then successfully created. The equation of total score was as follows: Total score = 1.2 Ã Age (score) + 1.6 Ã Onset-therapy time (score) + 1.3 Ã Initial hearing level (score) + 2.3 Ã Audiogram shape (score) + 2.8 Ã Vertigo (score).

{"text": "This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of unilateral cochlear implants (UCIs) for Finnish adults with severe to profound hearing loss within the contemporary Finnish healthcare system. We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model to compare UCIs with hearing aids for adults with severe to profound hearing loss. We developed an average clinical pathway based on data from three Finnish university hospitals to estimate resource use. The model captured health-related quality of life, potential adverse events, device upgrades, and device failure. We estimated unit costs from national expert opinions and from grey and published literature. We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate how uncertain model inputs affect the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER for UCIs compared to hearing aids in the Finnish adult population was â¬14,528 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated a 98,5% likelihood that UCIs are cost-effective compared to a â¬25,000 per QALY gained threshold. The ICER was most sensitive to the discount rate, UCI device and surgery costs, the utility increment from UCI treatment, costs associated with UCI fitting, and the cost and upgrade cycle of sound processors. UCIs for adults are cost-effective within the Finnish healthcare setting. Our results align with ICER findings for UCIs in the UK and Swedish adult populations, despite differences in indications, clinical pathways, and device unit costs. All studies suggest that UCIs are more cost-effective when implemented at an earlier age, given the same level of hearing performance.", "entities": [{"entity": "UNILATERAL", "start": 48, "end": 57, "matched_text": "UNILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROFOUND", "start": 118, "end": 125, "matched_text": "PROFOUND", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEARING LOSS", "start": 127, "end": 138, "matched_text": "HEARING LOSS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEARING", "start": 270, "end": 276, "matched_text": "HEARING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AIDS", "start": 278, "end": 281, "matched_text": "AIDS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "QUALITY", "start": 487, "end": 493, "matched_text": "QUALITY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 723, "end": 725, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ICER", "start": 799, "end": 802, "matched_text": "ICER", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Tracking the envelope of speech in the brain is important for speech comprehension. Recent research suggests that acoustic background noise can enhance neural speech tracking, enabling the auditory system to robustly encode speech even under unfavorable conditions. Aging and hearing loss are associated with internal, neural noise in the auditory system, raising the question whether additional acoustic background noise enhances neural speech tracking in older adults. In the current electroencephalography study, younger (â¼25.5 years) and older adults (â¼68.5 years) listened to spoken stories in quiet (clear) or in the presence of background noise at a wide range of different signal-to-noise ratios. In younger adults, early neural speech tracking responses (<0.15 s) were enhanced by minimal background noise, indicating response facilitation through noise. In contrast, older adults, compared to younger adults, showed enhanced neural speech tracking for clear speech and speech masked by minimal background noise, but the acoustic noise led to little enhancement of the early neural tracking response in older people. The data demonstrate different sensitivity of the auditory cortex to speech masked by noise between younger and older adults. The results are consistent with the idea that the auditory cortex of older people exhibits more internal, neural noise that enhances neural speech tracking but that additional acoustic noise does not further support speech encoding.

We sought to identify shared and distinct functional connectivity (FC) features across SSNHL and tinnitus patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore how virus influences brain network remodeling in SSNHL and tinnitus. We recruited 31 SSNHL patients with tinnitus following SARS-CoV-2 infection (COV-SSNHL), 32 non-viral SSNHL patients with tinnitus, and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Brain functional connectivity coefficients were used to construct graph data analyzed with a graph attention network (GAT) model for categorization. Analyses focused on the auditory network (AN), salience network (SN), and default mode network (DMN) and their correlations with tinnitus severity. Both SSNHL groups showed reduced connectivity within the SN and DMN, which correlated with tinnitus severity. Notably, COV-SSNHL patients exhibited distinct, complex network remodeling involving the AN, SN, and DMN, with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as a central mediator. This remodeling facilitated interactions within the SN and across networks, marking COV-SSNHL as neurologically unique. This study highlights the distinct neural alterations in brain networks in COV-SSNHL patients, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of viral-induced SSNHL and tinnitus.

{"text": "There is growing evidence that many perceptual difficulties associated with age-related hearing loss are not solely due to cochlear damage and are exacerbated by changes within the central nervous system. We examined electrophysiological (EEG) responses to clicks and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in 49 older (29 female) and 26 younger (20 female) adults to determine the extent to which auditory nerve (AN) deficits in older adults contributed to functional and structural changes throughout the auditory system. Older adults exhibited smaller AN responses, similar brainstem responses, and larger auditory cortex (AC) responses, demonstrating progressive \"central gain\". Audiometric thresholds were not predictive of EEG measures. Reduced AN function predicted deficits in cortical microstructure (lower AC fractional anisotropy, FA) in older adults, consistent with myelin degeneration. These lower FA values in the AC of older adults also predicted larger AC responses and more central gain. Older adults exhibited significantly lower AC FA and higher mean diffusivity (MD) than younger adults, and AC FA and MD were significant predictors of speech-in-noise (SIN) recognition in older adults. The results suggest that reduced afferent input in older adults not only results in functional changes throughout the auditory system consistent with progressive gain, but also contributes to deficits in AC structure beyond those explained by age alone, contributing to SIN deficits. Understanding the complex effects of age, reduced AN input, central gain, and AC structure on SIN recognition may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention. Age-related hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit with aging, but little is known about how the auditory cortex adapts to the chronic loss of afferent auditory input. We measured auditory nerve, brainstem, and cortical responses in younger and older adults. In older adults, deficits in afferent input predicted progressive hyperexcitability, or \"central gain\", at the brainstem and cortex. Smaller auditory nerve responses predicted poorer white matter structure in auditory cortex. Poorer white matter structure predicted smaller auditory cortex responses, more auditory cortical gain, and worse speech-in-noise recognition in older adults. This is the first study to show that reduced afferent input leads to both amplified cortical responses and reduced cortical integrity in older adults, contributing to speech-in-noise deficits.", "entities": [{"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 18, "end": 25, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEARING LOSS", "start": 89, "end": 100, "matched_text": "HEARING LOSS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 133, "end": 138, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXACERBATED BY", "start": 148, "end": 161, "matched_text": "EXACERBATED BY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM", "start": 182, "end": 203, "matched_text": "CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NERVE", "start": 402, "end": 406, "matched_text": "NERVE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AUDITORY SYSTEM", "start": 502, "end": 516, "matched_text": "AUDITORY SYSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BRAINSTEM", "start": 572, "end": 580, "matched_text": "BRAINSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CORTEX", "start": 613, "end": 618, "matched_text": "CORTEX", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROGRESSIVE", "start": 650, "end": 660, "matched_text": "PROGRESSIVE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 663, "end": 669, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SIN", "start": 1169, "end": 1171, "matched_text": "SIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIN", "start": 1169, "end": 1171, "matched_text": "SIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 1755, "end": 1757, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 1793, "end": 1799, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}]}

{"text": "Craving is a key concept in addictive disorders. However, despite seminal results identifying the pivotal role of its physical component, craving remains conceptualized as being centrally underpinned by psychological and cognitive processes. To explore the phenomenological dimension of physical craving in addiction, we measured self-reported body sensations of craving among individuals with subclinical (binge drinking, BD) or clinical (severe alcohol use disorder, SAUD) alcohol use disorders. We used a body mapping technique, allowing for the free report of the bodily counterparts of psychological phenomena, among 76 binge drinkers and 97 recently detoxified patients with SAUD. We measured the taxonomy, localization, intensity, and pleasantness of the craving bodily sensations. Physical sensations of craving were reported (1) for individuals with BD habits, mostly in the shoulders/thorax (53.95%), mouth (47.37%), and forehead (31.58%), in the form of palpitations, dryness, and tension; (2) for patients with SAUD, most often and with the highest average intensity in the hands (31.96%), forehead (24.74%), and shoulders/thorax (22.68%), in the form of tremors, perspiration, and palpitations. In BD, craving sensations were described as slightly unpleasant to pleasant. Conversely, in SAUD patients, craving was perceived as slightly to very unpleasant. These findings bring forth a novel perspective of the bodily mechanisms involved in craving. They support a dissociation between subclinical and clinical populations of excessive alcohol drinkers, as body sensations related to craving might generate alcohol consumption through positive reinforcement (to extend positive sensations) for subclinical populations and through negative reinforcement (to alleviate unpleasant body sensations) for clinical populations. More widely, we highlight the need to add perceived bodily sensations to the predominantly and exclusively cognitive focus that characterizes the craving research field, since craving is also underpinned by physical sensations.", "entities": [{"entity": "KEY", "start": 14, "end": 16, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 107, "end": 110, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BINGE DRINKING", "start": 408, "end": 421, "matched_text": "BINGE DRINKING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ALCOHOL USE DISORDER", "start": 448, "end": 467, "matched_text": "ALCOHOL USE DISORDER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ALCOHOL", "start": 476, "end": 482, "matched_text": "ALCOHOL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LOCALIZATION", "start": 714, "end": 725, "matched_text": "LOCALIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INTENSITY", "start": 728, "end": 736, "matched_text": "INTENSITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MOUTH", "start": 912, "end": 916, "matched_text": "MOUTH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PALPITATIONS", "start": 966, "end": 977, "matched_text": "PALPITATIONS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TREMORS", "start": 1168, "end": 1174, "matched_text": "TREMORS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PERSPIRATION", "start": 1177, "end": 1188, "matched_text": "PERSPIRATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DISSOCIATION", "start": 1478, "end": 1489, "matched_text": "DISSOCIATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ADD", "start": 1872, "end": 1874, "matched_text": "ADD", "type": "protein"}]}

This paper proposes a physical simulation approach modeling multiple arm joints and tremor propagation. This study also introduces a novel adaptable reinforcement learning environment tailored for disorders with tremors. We present a deep reinforcement learning-based encoder-actor controller for Parkinson's tremors in various shoulder and elbow joint axes displayed in dynamic movements.

Excess ammonia is highly toxic to the brain and can cause neurological dysfunctions, such as tremors, ataxia, seizures, coma, and even death. Hyperammonemia is often the primary manifestation of urea cycle disorders (UCDs), a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by impaired nitrogen detoxification due to dysfunctions in urea cycle-related enzymes and transporters. Patients with complete deficiencies of urea cycle enzymes typically present with lethargy, hypothermia, anorexia, seizures, abnormal respiratory patterns (hyperventilation or hypoventilation), neurologic posturing, and coma, along with hyperammonemia within a few days after birth.

Despite prior exposure to tablets, he lacked confidence in their use. He enrolled in a community-based ICT support program to improve daily activity engagement. Intervention: A four-month intervention, consisting of two sessions per month, was conducted. Initial assessments included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire-Japanese (MDPQ-J), and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The intervention involved guided tablet use, environmental modifications (tablet stand and stylus adaptation), and training in digital mapping and drawing applications. After the intervention, the MDPQ-J score improved from 9.58/40 to 13.96/40, and COPM satisfaction scores increased for both digital mapping (4/10 to 6/10) and drawing (5/10 to 7/10).

{"text": "Marker-based motion capture (MBMC) is a powerful tool for precise, high speed, three-dimensional tracking of animal movements, enabling detailed study of behaviors ranging from subtle limb trajectories to broad spatial exploration. Despite its proven utility in larger animals, MBMC has remained underutilized in mice due to the difficulty of robust marker attachment during unrestricted behavior. In response to this challenge, markerless tracking methods, facilitated by machine learning, have become the standard in small animal studies due to their simpler experimental setup. However, trajectories obtained with markerless approaches at best approximate ground-truth kinematics, with accuracy strongly dependent on video resolution, training dataset quality, and computational resources for data processing.Here, we overcome the primary limitation of MBMC in mice by implanting minimally invasive markers that remain securely attached over weeks of recordings. This technique produces high-resolution, artifact-free trajectories, eliminating the need for extensive post-processing. We demonstrate the advantages of MBMC by resolving subtle drug-induced kinematic changes that become apparent only within specific behavioral contexts, necessitating precise three-dimensional tracking beyond simple flat-surface locomotion. Furthermore, MBMC uniquely captures the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of harmaline-induced tremors, revealing previously inaccessible correlations between body parts and thus significantly improving the translational value of preclinical tremor models. While markerless tracking remains optimal for many behavioral neuroscience studies in which general posture estimation suffices, MBMC removes barriers to investigations demanding greater precision, reliability, and low-noise trajectories.

{"text": "Claudius, the fourth emperor of Rome, suffered from multiple health issues, including an unsteady gait, persistent tremors in his arms and head, and a speech impediment that caused him to stutter and mispronounce words since childhood. Despite possessing average or even above-average intellectual abilities, he was considered unfit for public office (cursus honorum) due to these physical conditions. Based on remaining historical records, modern scholars have proposed several possible diagnoses, including cerebral palsy, dystonia, transverse myelitis, or Tourette syndrome. While earlier scholarship argued that he had cerebral palsy, more recent interpretations favor dystonia or Tourette syndrome. This claim is supported by historical records that show how Claudius' symptoms fluctuated over time since his childhood and how he was able to maintain a relatively stable health during his reign, carrying out his imperial duties effectively. Claudius's physical impairments subjected him to harsh treatment from his family. His mother Antonia the Younger, his sister Livilla, and his paternal grandmother Livia treated him with contempt. In contrast, his adoptive grandfather Augustus showed some leniency, expressing hope that Claudius' condition might improve one day. None the less, both Augustus and his uncle Tiberius chose to excluded him from public service. His disabilities, especially his walking and speech issues, remained a source of ridicule even after his death. This is poignantly illustrated in Seneca's satirical poem \"Apocolocyntosis,\" which was written after his death. Unable to become a celebrated soldier or orator due to his physical limitations, Claudius was far removed from the Roman ideal of leadership both in his own times and in posterior times. He was often met with contempt and discrimination. Nevertheless, he proved to be a capable and successful emperor.

{"text": "Lafora disease (LD) is a rare, autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epilepsy caused by mutations in EPM2A or EPM2B. It is characterized by abnormal glycogen metabolism leading to poly-glucosan deposits, known as Lafora bodies, in various tissues. LD typically manifests during adolescence with progressive neurological decline, including myoclonic seizures, cognitive impairment, and ataxia. Early diagnosis is critical for symptom management, yet the disease remains challenging to treat due to its refractory nature. We report the case of a 15-year-old male who initially presented with tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, bilateral lower limb paralysis, and hand tremors. Despite normal initial imaging findings, subsequent clinical progression raised suspicion for progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Genetic testing identified a homozygous pathogenic variant in EPM2A, confirming the diagnosis of LD. electroencephalogram (EEG) findings evolved over time, showing generalized spikes, poly-spikes, and spike-wave complexes on a slow background, consistent with advanced LD. The patient's seizures proved refractory to standard anti-epileptic drugs, necessitating the addition of phenobarbital, metformin, and zonisamide, which eventually achieved partial seizure control. Family genetic screening identified heterozygous carriers without clinical symptoms, emphasizing the need for genetic counseling. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of LD, particularly in its early stages when clinical and imaging findings may be nonspecific.

{"text": "Craving is a key concept in addictive disorders. However, despite seminal results identifying the pivotal role of its physical component, craving remains conceptualized as being centrally underpinned by psychological and cognitive processes. To explore the phenomenological dimension of physical craving in addiction, we measured self-reported body sensations of craving among individuals with subclinical (binge drinking, BD) or clinical (severe alcohol use disorder, SAUD) alcohol use disorders. We used a body mapping technique, allowing for the free report of the bodily counterparts of psychological phenomena, among 76 binge drinkers and 97 recently detoxified patients with SAUD. We measured the taxonomy, localization, intensity, and pleasantness of the craving bodily sensations. Physical sensations of craving were reported (1) for individuals with BD habits, mostly in the shoulders/thorax (53.95%), mouth (47.37%), and forehead (31.58%), in the form of palpitations, dryness, and tension; (2) for patients with SAUD, most often and with the highest average intensity in the hands (31.96%), forehead (24.74%), and shoulders/thorax (22.68%), in the form of tremors, perspiration, and palpitations. In BD, craving sensations were described as slightly unpleasant to pleasant. Conversely, in SAUD patients, craving was perceived as slightly to very unpleasant. These findings bring forth a novel perspective of the bodily mechanisms involved in craving. They support a dissociation between subclinical and clinical populations of excessive alcohol drinkers, as body sensations related to craving might generate alcohol consumption through positive reinforcement (to extend positive sensations) for subclinical populations and through negative reinforcement (to alleviate unpleasant body sensations) for clinical populations. More widely, we highlight the need to add perceived bodily sensations to the predominantly and exclusively cognitive focus that characterizes the craving research field, since craving is also underpinned by physical sensations.", "entities": [{"entity": "KEY", "start": 14, "end": 16, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 107, "end": 110, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BINGE DRINKING", "start": 408, "end": 421, "matched_text": "BINGE DRINKING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ALCOHOL USE DISORDER", "start": 448, "end": 467, "matched_text": "ALCOHOL USE DISORDER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ALCOHOL", "start": 476, "end": 482, "matched_text": "ALCOHOL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LOCALIZATION", "start": 714, "end": 725, "matched_text": "LOCALIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INTENSITY", "start": 728, "end": 736, "matched_text": "INTENSITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MOUTH", "start": 912, "end": 916, "matched_text": "MOUTH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PALPITATIONS", "start": 966, "end": 977, "matched_text": "PALPITATIONS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TREMORS", "start": 1168, "end": 1174, "matched_text": "TREMORS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PERSPIRATION", "start": 1177, "end": 1188, "matched_text": "PERSPIRATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DISSOCIATION", "start": 1478, "end": 1489, "matched_text": "DISSOCIATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ADD", "start": 1872, "end": 1874, "matched_text": "ADD", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common arrhythmia, often responsive to pharmacologic intervention or electrical cardioversion. Resistance to direct current cardioversion (DCCV) is uncommon and can be clinically challenging. Lifestyle factors, including dietary stimulant intake, may influence arrhythmia dynamics and treatment responsiveness. We present a case of a 26-year-old female known to have SVT, who presented with six hours of palpitations, with a past medical history of successful cryoablation performed in 2021 for atrial tachycardia originating from tissue near the atrioventricular bundle. Her maintenance therapy included bisoprolol 2.5 mg. Notably, the patient reported regular and excessive consumption of energy drinks, averaging multiple servings daily. The pharmacological intervention failed to achieve rhythm control, necessitating DCCV. Despite appropriate sedation and energy dosing, initial cardioversion attempts were unsuccessful. Subsequent higher-energy shocks ultimately restored sinus rhythm. This case underscores an unusual presentation of cardioversion-resistant SVT in a young adult with prior ablation. The patient's habitual intake of energy drinks raises concern for potential pro-arrhythmic and electrophysiologic alterations induced by high caffeine and other stimulant content. While caffeine's arrhythmogenic potential is recognized, its role in altering myocardial excitability and threshold for cardioversion is not well established. This case adds to the limited literature suggesting that excessive stimulant use may contribute to treatment-resistant arrhythmic episodes. Clinicians should be aware of dietary and lifestyle factors, such as energy drink consumption, which may influence the efficacy of electrical cardioversion.

A 39-year-old woman, 18 weeks pregnant, with a history of rheumatic heart disease and prior surgical mitral commissurotomy, presented with palpitations, fatigue, and exertional breathlessness. She had severe MS (mitral valve area 0.8 cmÂ²) and severe tricuspid regurgitation, with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response. Due to a high Wilkins score, PBMV was attempted with a 28 mm Inoue balloon inflated to 28 mm, but was suboptimal due to significant valve rigidity. Adjunctive TMVL improved valve pliability, successfully reducing the mitral gradient and increasing valve area without worsening MR. The patient continued her pregnancy without complications.

Although the breast cancer was diagnosed as stage 0 (DCIS), the patient's heart failure symptoms worsened following surgical resection. As a result, further evaluation by the cardiology department was performed, leading to a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Subsequently, a hematology consultation was obtained, and bone marrow biopsy revealed that clonal plasma cells accounted for more than 60% of bone marrow cellularity, confirming a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient received daratumumab + bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone therapy, achieved a partial response, and has been alive for >2 years.

EP interventions in response to actionable arrhythmias included eight patients initiated on anticoagulation, three catheter ablations, one implantable cardiac defibrillator, and one permanent pacemaker implanted. In multivariate analysis, COPD was an independent predictor of actionable arrhythmias (aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2-15.2, p=0.02) when adjusting for chronic kidney disease and all-cause readmissions.

Unfortunately, the AP was mechanically traumatized during catheter placement, and conduction did not resume after a 45-min waiting period. We proceeded to determine the ventricular insertion of the AP. Pace mapping was performed at the ventricular aspect of the tricuspid annulus with bipolar pacing from the ablation catheter. Using electroanatomic mapping, a correlation map between the maximally pre-excited QRS morphology (recorded at the beginning of the electrophysiological study) and the pace-mapped QRS was displayed. The highest correlation was 94%. The area delimited by the 3 best pace-map matching points was considered the target area, and radiofrequency applications were delivered. No recurrence of pre-excitation or palpitations were observed during 6 months of follow-up.

The aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these devices in differentiating atrial fibrillation (AF) from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an irregular rhythm alert. This retrospective, single-center observational study was conducted in the ED of a tertiary hospital over a two-year period. The study included adult patients (â¥22 years) who presented to the ED following an irregular rhythm alert generated by their smartwatch. Smartwatches were classified as either ECG-capable devices or PPG-based devices. Final rhythm diagnoses were confirmed by two independent emergency physicians based on 12âlead ECG findings obtained during the ED evaluation. A total of 424 patients were included. Of these, 63.7 % (n = 270) used ECG-capable smartwatches, and 66.3 % (n = 281) received an AF alert. Among all alerts, 60.8 % (n = 258) were ECG-based and 39.2 % (n = 166) were PPG-based. Common presenting symptoms included palpitations (56.1 %), dizziness (21.7 %), and dyspnea (23.6 %), while 8.5 % of patients were asymptomatic. In total, 44.6 % (n = 189) required pharmacologic or electrical interventions. Smartwatches demonstrated moderate accuracy for AF and SVT detection. PPG-based detection showed higher sensitivity than ECG-based detection (AF: 54.3 % vs. 44.9 %; SVT: 83.6 % vs. 79.2 %). Agreement with final ECG diagnoses was poor (Cohen's Kappa = 0), with significant misclassification for both arrhythmias (McNemar's p < 0.001), except for PPG-based SVT (p = 0.072).

A search across multiple databases was done for Phase II/III RCTs from Jan. 2010 to June 2024. Adults with OAB or overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) â¥ 3 were included. Trials evaluating vibegron (monotherapy/combination) and mirabegron combination therapies were eligible.

Primary outcomes included micturition frequency (MF), urgency episodes (UE), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mean voided volume (MVV). Secondary outcomes were adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (AELTD), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (sAEs), dry mouth, and constipation. Data analysis used the netmeta R package with both NMAs and cNMA. Twelve studies (11,374 participants) were included. Vibegron outperformed mirabegron and antimuscarinics in reducing micturition frequency, with 100 mg vibegron showing the greatest reduction (SMD = - 0.87, 95% CI - 1.16 to - 0.59).

{"text": "We present a case of a patient diagnosed with optic neuritis (ON) and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) following Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) pneumonia. A 60-year-old male, 16 days post-M.pneumoniae pneumonia, was evaluated for vision loss-no light perception in the right eye and perceiving only finger movements at a distance of 20 cm in the left. He also exhibited paraparesis, absent tendon reflexes in the lower limbs, urinary incontinence, and sensory deficits below the left L1 and right T10 dermatomes. Clinical data were collected, followed by a literature review of case reports from the 1990s to the present. Serum testing showed positive IgG antibodies against GM1 and GD1b, while cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for these antibodies. CSF analysis indicated mild pleocytosis and slight protein elevation, with negative PCR for M.pneumoniae. Cranial MRI identified contrast-enhanced lesions in the left occipital lobe, the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and adjacent tracts, while spinal MRI revealed multiple intramedullary lesions at C2-C4, T4-T7, and T10-T11 levels. Nerve conduction studies were normal. The patient received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and moxifloxacin, leading to a significant improvement in myelitic symptoms and partial recovery of visual function. The literature review indicated ten cases of isolated ON, nineteen with isolated acute myelitis, and five with concomitant ON and myelitis. MOG-like ON, either occurring in isolation or in conjunction with LETM (i.e.NMOSD-like), is a rare complication following M.pneumoniae infection.

The giant CCs of the cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) are located in the hard-to-reach areas of the brain, and they can be removed microsurgically and endoscopically. At present, the transition from the microsurgical resection to the endoscopic is observed, and researchers demonstrate several benefits of the endoscopic resection over the microsurgical. We noticed the absence of research illustrating the endoscopic resection of the giant CC of the CSP. Therefore, we decided to demonstrate a rare case performed in our hospital. Our patient was a 57-year-old male who had suffered from dizziness, headache, nausea, urinary incontinence, short-term forgetfulness, gait ataxia, cognitive decline, and vision blurring. The eventual diagnosis of the giant CC in the CSP was established, and it was complicated by occlusive hydrocephalus and headache syndrome. The endoscopic resection of the giant CC in the septum pellucidum was performed using the endoscopic transseptal approach. No complications were observed in the postoperative period. The tumor was removed completely, no recurrence was noted, and only a capsule of the tumor was observed in the control magnetic resonance imaging image taken 3 months after the operation.

Eligibility was established through in-person evaluations, during which pelvic floor physiotherapists taught and verified correct pelvic floor muscles contraction using digital palpation. The 12-week online pelvic floor muscle training program comprised weekly one-hour training sessions, followed by an unsupervised maintenance exercise regimen. Data were collected before the program (PRE), immediately after (POST), during an interim phone call three months after the end of the program (3MO) and at a follow-up six months after the end of the program (6MO). Participants reported symptoms of urinary incontinence using a 7-day bladder diary and standardized questionnaires at PRE, POST and 6MO. Adherence to maintenance exercises was recorded at 3MO and 6MO. At 6MO, participants provided feedback on their perceived improvement and overall satisfaction. Women experienced a median leakage reduction of 73 % (range 38-88 %) from PRE to 6MO. Improvements were maintained from POST to 6MO for leakage episodes, symptoms of urinary incontinence, quality of life, and urinary incontinence self-efficacy. Adherence to maintenance exercises was substantial at 3MO and 6MO. Participants expressed high satisfaction with symptom improvement and the program overall at 6MO.

{"text": "Suburethral mid-urethral sling (SMUS) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). In recent years, the vaginal single-incision mini-sling (SIMS) has emerged as a new approach for treating SUI. However, the efficacy and safety of SIMS require further experimental validation.This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the vaginal SIMS compared to SMUS in the treatment of female SUI. This study incorporated studies published from Jan 2007 through May 2024, encompassing our complete literature search and selection timeline. Following the inclusion criteria for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we performed a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the vaginal SIMS and SMUS. All published RCTs involving women with SUI receiving SIMS or SMUS were eligible for inclusion, with no exclusion criteria based on language, type of SIMS/SMUS devices, or publication status. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3, with primary outcomes being patient-reported and objective cure rates. Secondary outcomes included operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative day one pain scores, quality of life assessments, and certain safety-related surgical indicators. A total of 24 randomized controlled trials were included, comprising 3,687 women, of whom 328 were lost to follow-up, with a mean follow-up duration of 13.42 months. SIMS showed a slight superiority over SMUS in terms of objective cure rates (RR: 0.93; 95% CI, [0.85, 0.98]). Compared to SMUS, SIMS was significantly associated with reduced operative time (MD: - 6.52; 95% CI, [-9.47, - 3.57]), shorter hospital stays (MD: - 0.23; 95% CI, [-0.42, - 0.05]), lower pain scores on postoperative day one (MD: - 2.28; 95% CI, [-3.21, - 1.36]), lower incidence of organ injury (RR: 0.30; 95% CI, [0.13, 0.69]), less groin pain (RR: 0.24; 95% CI, [0.08, 0.73]) and less postoperative bleeding (MD: - 24.27 ml; 95% CI, [-32.32, - 16.23]). However, there were no statistically significant differences between SIMS and SMUS regarding patient-reported cure rates, quality of life, urinary difficulties, sling erosion, dyspareunia, reoperation, new-onset urgency incontinence, postoperative urinary tract infections, or other postoperative complications. SIMS is not inferior to SMUS in terms of patient-reported cure rates, objective cure rates, quality of life, and postoperative complications in treating female SUI.

A search across multiple databases was done for Phase II/III RCTs from Jan. 2010 to June 2024. Adults with OAB or overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) â¥ 3 were included. Trials evaluating vibegron (monotherapy/combination) and mirabegron combination therapies were eligible.

Primary outcomes included micturition frequency (MF), urgency episodes (UE), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mean voided volume (MVV). Secondary outcomes were adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (AELTD), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (sAEs), dry mouth, and constipation. Data analysis used the netmeta R package with both NMAs and cNMA. Twelve studies (11,374 participants) were included. Vibegron outperformed mirabegron and antimuscarinics in reducing micturition frequency, with 100 mg vibegron showing the greatest reduction (SMD = - 0.87, 95% CI - 1.16 to - 0.59). Combination therapies generally had better efficacy in improving UE and UUI than monotherapies, except mirabegron 50 mg + tamsulosin. No significant MVV differences between treatments and controls. For AEs, there were no significant differences in overall AEs or AELTD between treatments and controls. But higher doses and combination therapies had higher risks of dry mouth and constipation. Component network meta-analysis (cNMA) showed greater reductions in micturition frequency, suggesting possible negative interactions, whereas standard NMA showed synergistic effects on urgency episodes (UE) and mean voided volume (MVV).

{"text": "It has been shown that 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluates the efficacy and safety of ondansetron, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, as adjunctive treatment for the management of schizophrenia, especially the negative symptoms. A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science, was performed in October 2024. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and their data were extracted and analyzed using RevMan 5.4 software. The primary outcome was the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) negative subscale. Eight RCTs involving 533 patients were included in the study. Ondansetron showed a statistically significant improvement in PANSS negative subscale at 12 weeks [pooled as mean difference, MD = -2.96, 95 % CI [-4.69, -1.24], P-value = 0.00007] and in general psychopathology scale [MD = -2.71, 95 % CI [-3.52, -1.90] compared to placebo. However, ondansetron and placebo did not differ in reduction of PANSS positive subscale [MD = 0.1, 95 % CI [-1.19, 1.38], P-value = 0.88], and depression scale. Ondansetron showed no significant difference regarding tardive dyskinesia between the two groups. However, constipation was significant in the ondansetron group over placebo.

{"text": "Pediatric neurogastroenterology conditions, including disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and motility disorders, affect millions of children worldwide. Due to limited pediatric data, reference ranges and management are often extrapolated from adult studies. We review four pediatric neurogastroenterology areas where clinical science may translate and inform adult gastroenterology. Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency can be diagnosed via disaccharidase enzyme testing from duodenal mucosal biopsies. Dietary restriction and sacrosidase supplementation are effective, based on randomized controlled trials, in children with genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency; however, they remain to be rigorously studied in adults. Gastric emptying breath testing (GEBT) in large cohorts of children reinforces the importance of biological sex, puberty, and size while deriving normative reference values. Further study of GEBT in adults may help determine the influence of sex and hormones on gastric emptying rates, offering an opportunity to develop tailored reference ranges. Antegrade continence enema (ACE) therapy is the most common reversible surgical treatment for children with chronic constipation with high rates of efficacy. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of ACE in adult populations. Auricular neurostimulation through percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia based on sham-controlled, randomized trials with emerging efficacy data in other pediatric DGBI.

Among these, paraduodenal hernias represent a significant subtype and require prompt recognition and intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no significant medical or surgical history who presented with a three-day history of generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Clinical examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory findings were unremarkable except for leukocytosis. Abdominal X-ray demonstrated features of small bowel obstruction, and CT imaging identified findings suggestive of a left paraduodenal hernia. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a large encapsulated peritoneal sac originating from the left paraduodenal region and extending into the pelvis. Dilated and edematous but viable small bowel loops were released, and adhesiolysis was performed. A planned second-look surgery two days later confirmed resolution of bowel edema, and the abdomen was closed without complications. Paraduodenal hernias arise from a congenital anomaly involving the mesentery and often present as intermittent or acute bowel obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms but can be facilitated by CT imaging. Definitive management involves surgical reduction and repair of the hernia, whether through open or laparoscopic approaches.

While emerging evidence suggests that gut-brain interactions play a role in affective disorders, the relationship between constipation severity and sleep disturbances remains underexplored. This study examined the mediating effect of constipation severity on the relationship between affective symptoms and sleep quality in people with schizophrenia. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 256 participants with schizophrenia across two psychiatric hospitals. Structured questionnaires were used to assess affective symptoms, constipation severity, and sleep quality. We analyzed the mediating role of constipation severity while controlling for seven covariates by conducting multiple regression analysis using the SPSS PROCESS macro model 4. Anxiety, depressive symptoms, constipation severity, and sleep quality were found to be interconnected. The findings showed that neither anxiety nor depressive symptoms significantly impacted sleep quality when accounting for constipation severity, indicating that constipation fully mediated the relationship between affective symptoms and sleep quality. In individuals with schizophrenia, constipation has a greater negative impact on sleep quality than affective symptoms.

In addition to pointing to the hormonal imbalance linked to post-menopause as a potential cause of dry eye, this also highlights the urgent need to review the necessary therapeutic approach. Evidence suggests that ocular testosterone therapy, particularly 0.03% testosterone eye drops, can significantly improve tear film stability and relieve dry eye symptoms. Furthermore, it has an added benefit of bypassing the systemic circulation, providing a targeted ocular effect with minimal side effects. However, challenges such as ocular barrier penetration, formulation stability, and regulatory issues in India hinder its widespread adoption.

It frequently overlaps with other autoimmune diseases (AIDs), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the genetic basis of SjD remains underexplored, limiting our understanding of its connections to other immune-mediated conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify gene networks associated with SjD through the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data. We further compared the genetic factors of SjD with other immune-mediated diseases. We analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, DNA methylation, and transcriptomic data using our in-house network-based methods, dmGWAS and EW_dmGWAS, to identify key gene modules associated with SjD. In dmGWAS analysis, discovery and evaluation datasets were used to identify consensus results. We conducted gene-set, cell-type, and disease-enrichment analyses on significant gene modules and explored potential drug targets. Genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization were applied to assess SjD's link with 17 other AIDs and 16 cancer types. dmGWAS identified 207 and 211 gene modules in the discovery and evaluation phases, respectively, while EW_dmGWAS detected 886 modules. Key modules highlighted 55 genes (discovery), 52 genes (evaluation), and 59 genes (EW_dmGWAS), with at least 50 genes from each analysis linked to AIDs and cancer. Enrichment analyses confirmed their relevance to immune and oncogenic pathways. We pinpointed four candidate drug targets associated with AIDs. We developed a novel integrative omics approach to identify potential genetic markers of SjD and compared them with AIDs and cancers.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of orally administered quinine sulfate for muscle cramps in ALS patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in ALS patients experiencing daily muscle cramps. After a two-week run-in period, patients were assigned to receive 250 mg quinine sulfate once daily, followed by a placebo or vice versa. Each treatment period lasted 2 weeks and was followed by a 4-week washout period. Patients used a daily diary to rate muscle cramp intensity on the numeric rating scale (NRS) and record muscle cramp frequency. The primary outcome measure was change in cramp intensity; coprimary outcome measures were number of muscle cramps during daytime and nighttime. Data from four women and three men were included in the analysis, all of whom reported a notable reduction in cramp intensity and frequency, leading them to continue the medication. Quinine sulfate was well-tolerated, with two patients reporting mild tinnitus. Cramp intensity was significantly reduced by 48% (p = 0.042). Further, the number of daytime muscle cramps declined significantly (p = 0.024). Our findings suggest the potential efficacy of quinine sulfate in reducing muscle cramp intensity and frequency in ALS patients. However, the small sample size (n = 7) limits generalizability.

The prevalence and severity of DSI were significantly higher during lockdown than pre-lockdown. Notably, itching, trouble staying asleep, bone or joint pain, muscle cramps, feeling irritability, difficulty concentrating, headache, constipation, and feeling nervous were observed ( We found a higher prevalence of DSI in MHD patients during the COVID-19 lockdown.

{"text": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk increases substantially around the typical age of menopause (â¼51 yrs). While the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain to be precisely elucidated, menopause-related autonomic (dys)function likely plays a key role in CVD development in postmenopausal females. Sympathetic activity is known to increase with age and may rise more steeply in older females, resulting in autonomic imbalance and chronic disease. The menopausal loss of estradiol, a major female sex hormone, contributes to changes in autonomic and vascular physiology and is implicated in prominent menopause symptoms such as sleep difficulty and vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes/night sweats). Estrogen replacement can mitigate some of these negative health effects, but hormone therapy may not be able to reverse all menopause-linked autonomic dysfunction. Thus, this review explores the vast and complex web connecting menopause physiology and symptomatology, including how sex-hormone loss and menopause symptoms may impact autonomic function- in particular, through altered sympathetic regulation of blood pressure and impaired vagal tone- as a gateway to adverse cardiovascular health and greater CVD risk.", "entities": [{"entity": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 22, "matched_text": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MENOPAUSE", "start": 85, "end": 93, "matched_text": "MENOPAUSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "YRS", "start": 102, "end": 104, "matched_text": "YRS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 248, "end": 250, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 252, "end": 255, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "IMBALANCE", "start": 421, "end": 429, "matched_text": "IMBALANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 435, "end": 441, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 443, "end": 449, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 501, "end": 503, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SLEEP", "start": 632, "end": 636, "matched_text": "SLEEP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOT", "start": 673, "end": 675, "matched_text": "HOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NIGHT SWEATS", "start": 685, "end": 696, "matched_text": "NIGHT SWEATS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NIGHT SWEATS", "start": 685, "end": 696, "matched_text": "NIGHT SWEATS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION", "start": 841, "end": 861, "matched_text": "AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 978, "end": 980, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REGULATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE", "start": 1096, "end": 1123, "matched_text": "REGULATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE", "type": "gene"}]}

{"text": "Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is generally thought to be neuroprotective, yet results have been inconsistent. Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in females from the UK Biobank. 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included. Detailed MHT prescription data from primary care records was available for 538. We tested for associations between the brain measures (i.e. gray/white matter brain age, hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes) and MHT user status, age at first and last use, duration of use, formulation, route of administration, dosage, type, and active ingredient. We further tested for the effects of a history of hysterectomy Â± bilateral oophorectomy among MHT users and examined associations by APOE Îµ4 status. Current MHT users, not past users, showed older gray and white matter brain age, with a difference of up to 9 mo, and smaller hippocampal volumes compared to never-users. Longer duration of use and older age at last use post-menopause was associated with older gray and white matter brain age, larger white matter hyperintensity volume, and smaller hippocampal volumes. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy Â± bilateral oophorectomy showed Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT use and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history. The authors received funding from the Research Council of Norway (LTW: 223273, 249795, 273345, 298646, 300768), the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (CB: 2023037, 2022103; LTW: 2018076, 2019101), the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (LTW: 802998), the Swiss National Science Foundation (AMGdL: PZ00P3_193658), the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (LAMG: PJT-173554), the Treliving Family Chair in Women's Mental Health at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (LAMG), womenmind at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (LAMG, BHL), the Ann S. Bowers Women's Brain Health Initiative (EGJ), and the National Institutes of Health (EGJ: AG063843). Ovarian hormones, including oestrogens and progesterone, fluctuate throughout each menstrual cycle, during and after pregnancy, and in the years leading up to menopause when ovarian function begins to decline. During these transitional years, up to 80% of women will experience symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, which are believed to stem from the brain. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) often contains low doses of estrogens with or without progesterone and is commonly prescribed to minimize menopausal symptoms. MHT is believed to protect the brain and reduce the risk of Alzheimerâs disease; however, the evidence supporting this claim is conflicting. Furthermore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the risks and benefits of MHT on brain health. It remains unclear whether other factors, including a genetic predisposition to Alzheimerâs disease, the age at which MHT begins, the formulation, and the route of administration (e.g., pills or a transdermal patch), affect the impact of MHT on the brain. Addressing these questions is crucial to inform clinical decision-making regarding the prescription of MHT and to subsequently enhance womenâs brain health during and beyond the menopause transition. Barth et al. analyzed brain imaging data as well as data about lifestyle and demographic factors and histories of gynecological surgeries, of over 20,000 current, past, and never users of MHT from the UK Biobank cohort. As a proxy for brain health, they calculated the so-called âbrain age gapâ, which refers to the difference between a personâs actual chronological age and their estimated brain age calculated from brain imaging data using machine learning; e.g., if someoneâs chronological age is 50 years and their predicted brain age is 45, the brain age gap is â5 years. A negative brain age gap indicates a 'younger-looking' brain, while a positive brain age gap suggests a brain that appears 'older'. Barth et al. further looked at the volume of the hippocampus, a brain region important for memory, learning and emotion regulation. They found that women who were current MHT users had an âolder looking brainâ than women who had never taken MHT. The volume of the hippocampus was also smaller. In past users, the age at which MHT was last taken also made a difference. Those who were older at the time of their last use after menopause had an âolder lookingâ brain and lower hippocampal volumes. Similar results were found for women who took MHT for longer. However, women on MHT who had undergone surgery to remove their womb and/or both ovaries had a âyounger looking brainâ than women on MHT without similar surgical histories. Interestingly, factors such as a genetic risk for Alzheimerâs disease, differences in formulations, or methods of administration did not appear to affect brain health in this study. The findings of Barth et al. suggest that MHT does not have a general neuroprotective effect, nor does it lead to severe adverse effects on brain health. Instead, the impact of MHT on the brain may be influenced by various factors, including age, duration of use, and past surgical history. However, since the study is cross-sectional, meaning it was conducted at a single point in time, direct causality cannot be established. Future research examining the long-term impact of MHT on brain health is crucial for understanding individual risk profiles and benefits. Women around the world are faced with critical decisions regarding MHT use, yet the current lack of comprehensive research leaves them without the necessary evidence to make informed choices.", "entities": [{"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 168, "end": 172, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "WHITE MATTER HYPERINTENSITY", "start": 479, "end": 505, "matched_text": "WHITE MATTER HYPERINTENSITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BILATERAL", "start": 722, "end": 730, "matched_text": "BILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "APOE", "start": 790, "end": 793, "matched_text": "APOE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PAST", "start": 830, "end": 833, "matched_text": "PAST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 1027, "end": 1030, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MENOPAUSE", "start": 1032, "end": 1040, "matched_text": "MENOPAUSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PAST SURGICAL HISTORY", "start": 1391, "end": 1411, "matched_text": "PAST SURGICAL HISTORY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MENSTRUAL CYCLE", "start": 2237, "end": 2251, "matched_text": "MENSTRUAL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOT FLASHES", "start": 2449, "end": 2459, "matched_text": "HOT FLASHES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NIGHT SWEATS", "start": 2465, "end": 2476, "matched_text": "NIGHT SWEATS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NIGHT SWEATS", "start": 2465, "end": 2476, "matched_text": "NIGHT SWEATS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 2756, "end": 2762, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 2778, "end": 2785, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CLAIM", "start": 2803, "end": 2807, "matched_text": "CLAIM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GAP", "start": 3682, "end": 3684, "matched_text": "GAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LEARNING", "start": 3846, "end": 3853, "matched_text": "LEARNING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MEMORY", "start": 4200, "end": 4205, "matched_text": "MEMORY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 4229, "end": 4238, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 4983, "end": 4985, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LEAD", "start": 5142, "end": 5145, "matched_text": "LEAD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 5499, "end": 5502, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LACK", "start": 5694, "end": 5697, "matched_text": "LACK", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "A patient with untreated chronic HIV infection was admitted for further treatment of acute pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise. In the presence of constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), no evidence of malignancy and/or opportunistic infection was found. Abdominal ultrasound revealed small amounts of ascites without evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as well as underlying steatohepatitis with hypoproteinemia and right heart failure. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated. Fulminant peritonitis developed, which did not respond to broad anti-infective therapy. Furthermore, progressive respiratory failure developed. An immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was considered as a possibility and, finally, peritoneal as well as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were diagnosed. SUMMARY: In case of unexplained inflammatory response following the initiation of ART, IRIS due to tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and treated at an early stage. Before initiating ART, opportunistic infections, in particular TB if clinically suspected, must be ruled out by biopsy if necessary. Ein 33-jÃ¤hriger Patient mit unbehandelter Humane Immundefizienz Virus (HIV)-Infektion wurde aufgrund einer akuten Lungenembolie mit hÃ¤modynamischer EinschrÃ¤nkung zur weiteren Behandlung Ã¼bernommen. Bei vorliegender B-Symptomatik (Fieber, NachtschweiÃ und Gewichtsverlust) ergaben sich zunÃ¤chst keine Hinweise auf ein Malignom und/oder eine opportunistische Infektion. Sonografisch zeigten sich initial wenig Aszites ohne Nachweis einer spontan bakteriellen Peritonitis (SBP) bei zugrunde liegender Fettleberhepatitis mit HypoproteinÃ¤mie und Rechtsherzdekompensation. Wir veranlassten die Einleitung einer antiretroviralen Therapie (ART). Es kam zu einem komplikativen Verlauf mit Entstehung einer fulminanten Peritonitis, die nicht auf eine breite antiinfektive Therapie ansprach. Im Weiteren zeigte sich eine respiratorische Verschlechterung mit progredienter OxygenierungsstÃ¶rung. Differenzialdiagnostisch wurde ein Immunrekonstitutionssyndrom (IRIS) vermutet und im Verlauf zunÃ¤chst eine peritoneale und schlieÃlich eine offene Lungentuberkulose (TB) diagnostiziert. FAZIT: Bei (hyper-)inflammatorischem Krankheitsbild unter neu begonnener ART sollte ein demaskierendes IRIS auf dem Boden einer bislang okkulten TB (TB-IRIS) frÃ¼hzeitig differenzialdiagnostisch in ErwÃ¤gung gezogen und gezielt therapiert werden. Vor Einleitung einer ART mÃ¼ssen opportunistische Infektionen, insbesondere eine TB bei klinischem Verdacht ggf. auch mittels Biopsie, ausgeschlossen werden.", "entities": [{"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 26, "end": 32, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HIV INFECTION", "start": 34, "end": 46, "matched_text": "HIV INFECTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PULMONARY EMBOLISM", "start": 92, "end": 109, "matched_text": "PULMONARY EMBOLISM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PULMONARY EMBOLISM", "start": 92, "end": 109, "matched_text": "PULMONARY EMBOLISM", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FEVER", "start": 184, "end": 188, "matched_text": "FEVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FEVER", "start": 184, "end": 188, "matched_text": "FEVER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NIGHT SWEATS", "start": 191, "end": 202, "matched_text": "NIGHT SWEATS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NIGHT SWEATS", "start": 191, "end": 202, "matched_text": "NIGHT SWEATS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "WEIGHT LOSS", "start": 205, "end": 215, "matched_text": "WEIGHT LOSS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "WEIGHT LOSS", "start": 205, "end": 215, "matched_text": "WEIGHT LOSS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 222, "end": 229, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION", "start": 252, "end": 274, "matched_text": "OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ASCITES", "start": 334, "end": 340, "matched_text": "ASCITES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ASCITES", "start": 334, "end": 340, "matched_text": "ASCITES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PERITONITIS", "start": 384, "end": 394, "matched_text": "PERITONITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PERITONITIS", "start": 384, "end": 394, "matched_text": "PERITONITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SBP", "start": 397, "end": 399, "matched_text": "SBP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPOPROTEINEMIA", "start": 445, "end": 459, "matched_text": "HYPOPROTEINEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEART FAILURE", "start": 471, "end": 483, "matched_text": "HEART FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEART FAILURE", "start": 471, "end": 483, "matched_text": "HEART FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ART", "start": 510, "end": 512, "matched_text": "ART", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 569, "end": 571, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROGRESSIVE", "start": 631, "end": 641, "matched_text": "PROGRESSIVE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RESPIRATORY FAILURE", "start": 643, "end": 661, "matched_text": "RESPIRATORY FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RESPIRATORY FAILURE", "start": 643, "end": 661, "matched_text": "RESPIRATORY FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SYNDROME", "start": 712, "end": 719, "matched_text": "SYNDROME", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "IRIS", "start": 722, "end": 725, "matched_text": "IRIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS", "start": 796, "end": 817, "matched_text": "PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS", "start": 796, "end": 817, "matched_text": "PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE", "start": 872, "end": 892, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TUBERCULOSIS", "start": 939, "end": 950, "matched_text": "TUBERCULOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MIT", "start": 1192, "end": 1194, "matched_text": "MIT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VIRUS", "start": 1232, "end": 1236, "matched_text": "VIRUS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ZUR", "start": 1332, "end": 1334, "matched_text": "ZUR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UND", "start": 1423, "end": 1425, "matched_text": "UND", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DIE", "start": 1758, "end": 1760, "matched_text": "DIE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NEU", "start": 2305, "end": 2307, "matched_text": "NEU", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VOR", "start": 2494, "end": 2496, "matched_text": "VOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GGF", "start": 2602, "end": 2604, "matched_text": "GGF", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, with limited therapeutic options. Traditional treatments primarily focus on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), which aim to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which modulate serotonin levels. However, these treatments often provide only modest symptom relief. This review explores the potential benefits of combined targeting of cholinesterases and serotonin reuptake as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. We discuss the pathophysiological role of acetylcholine and serotonin in AD, highlighting their impact on cognitive function, mood regulation, and neuroplasticity. By targeting both cholinergic and serotonergic systems, this dual approach may offer synergistic effects, improving cognitive function, reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms, and enhancing neuroprotective mechanisms. The review also examines preclinical and clinical studies investigating the efficacy of combination therapies and outlines the challenges and opportunities in their development.

{"text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory loss, synaptic impairment, and biochemical changes. The study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective role of ferulic acid (FA) in an AD mouse C57BL/6 model induced by the AÎ²(25-35) peptide. Cognitive deficits, which include memory and spatial learning deficits caused by AÎ², were evaluated using a set of behavioural tests. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Western blot analysis were used to characterize the exosomes from the brain and the serum. The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in exosomes was also evaluated, and the proteomic analysis of the serum-derived exosomes was conducted through LC-MS Triple ToF and bioinformatics to identify the altered pathways associated with identified proteins. The results obtained showed that there were significant alterations in the exosomal proteome profile after AÎ² treatment. The levels of some of the proteins that are involved in energy metabolism, amyloid clearance, cytoskeleton, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation were particularly affected. Treatment with the phytochemical FA modulated the exosomal proteome profile alterations and the activity of AChE in exosomes, which are some of the hallmarks of cholinergic dysfunction in the case of AD. However, the analysis of the proteome of the AD condition revealed that there were distinct alterations in the content of serum-derived exosomes, which could be used as candidates for non-invasive biomarkers of AD progression.

The median time from infection to treatment was 229 days (Q1, Q3: 117, 367) and median length of stay in the program was 4.9 months (Q1, Q3: 3.1, 6.3). A history of depression and anxiety was found in 38% and 46% of this population, respectively.

{"text": "Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and caregivers were surveyed to understand their attitudes, emotions, and experiences with the disease, its treatments, and their willingness to explore genetic testing. A non-interventional, cross-sectional, online, quantitative-qualitative survey was conducted from 17-February to 9March 2022 among patients (â¥21-years old) with mCRPC (diagnosis for â¥3-months) and caregivers. A total of 221 patients with mCRPC and 159 caregivers from USA, France, Germany, Canada, Spain, China, and Brazil were surveyed. mCRPC impacts mood, emotional and mental health (50-77%), sleep (48-68%), career goals (48-80%), and social activities (46-65%). Primary symptoms/side effects are urination issues (trouble urinating: 33-60%; painful/burning urination: 32-50%, frequent urination: 27-50%) and sexual dysfunction (lower libido: 10-57%), which impact romantic relationships. Caregivers often spouses or partners, provide practical, financial, and emotional support, averaging 11 hours/week of providing care. Patients face high treatment and pill burden (7-12 pills/day) and prefer simpler treatment regimens. Hope motivates patients and genetic testing is one such avenue of hope. mCRPC is a life-changing diagnosis with physical, psychological, and financial burdens. By encouraging early genetic testing and fostering patient-centered conversation, HCPs can provide personalized care for optimized treatment outcomes in mCRPC. This study assessed the experiences of people living with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) â a type of advanced prostate cancer that may not respond to certain treatments â and the caregivers who support such individuals. Researchers surveyed patients and caregivers in seven countries to better understand how mCRPC affects daily life and how they feel about treatments and genetic testing. The results showed that mCRPC has a major impact on many areas of life, including mood, mental health, sleep, career goals, and social activities. Common symptoms include problems with urination and trouble with sex, which also affect romantic relationships. Most caregivers were spouses or partners who provided both emotional and financial support, spending an average of 11 hours each week helping their loved ones. Patients take many pills daily and generally prefer simpler treatment routines. Despite the challenges, many patients remain hopeful, and some see genetic testing as a promising option for more personalized treatment. In conclusion, mCRPC affects physical health, mental well-being and finances of both patients and caregivers. Encouraging early genetic testing and supportive conversations between patients and healthcare providers may lead to better treatment experiences and outcomes.", "entities": [{"entity": "PROSTATE CANCER", "start": 47, "end": 61, "matched_text": "PROSTATE CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROSTATE CANCER", "start": 47, "end": 61, "matched_text": "PROSTATE CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 166, "end": 172, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SLEEP", "start": 641, "end": 645, "matched_text": "SLEEP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "URINATION", "start": 746, "end": 754, "matched_text": "URINATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FREQUENT URINATION", "start": 826, "end": 843, "matched_text": "FREQUENT URINATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FREQUENT URINATION", "start": 826, "end": 843, "matched_text": "FREQUENT URINATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION", "start": 858, "end": 875, "matched_text": "SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FACE", "start": 1081, "end": 1084, "matched_text": "FACE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FACE", "start": 1081, "end": 1084, "matched_text": "FACE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HOPE", "start": 1173, "end": 1176, "matched_text": "HOPE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 1827, "end": 1829, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 2124, "end": 2126, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LEAD", "start": 2768, "end": 2771, "matched_text": "LEAD", "type": "disease"}]}

We reviewed our previous experiences regarding hypospadias complications to identify the relevant factors affecting the occurrence of UD after hypospadias surgery and adjust management strategies accordingly. A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 159 pediatric patients who underwent urethroplasty with disconnection of the urethral plate (DUP) in our department from January 2020 to December 2022. The collected information included patient demographics such as age, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (HCT), Albumin (ALB), Prealbumin (PALB), Procalcitonin (PCT), the employed surgical methods, whether the procedure was performed in stages, glans width, urethral stricture, penile curvature after correction, length of urethral defect, length of reconstructed urethra, indwelling catheter size and duration. The study population was divided into a group with UD and a group without UD, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Among 159 patients with a mean follow-up of 31.87 Â± 10.32 months, 14 (8.64%) patients developed UD after urethroplasty surgery.

They underwent to mid-urethral sling procedure or Burch colposuspension. The preoperative data, objective assessment of urinary incontinence and previous interventions were analyzed. Postoperatively, the presence of SUI, the degree of urinary incontinence and the quality of life were assessed. Data on additional surgical procedures was collected at a follow-up visit. A total of 179 patients underwent correction of SUI. Data on 10 patients with recurrent SUI were included. The age of the women was from 32 to 74 years (median 65 years, IQR 28), and one of them had a hysterectomy. Before our interventions, 9 patients underwent a single surgical procedure for SUI and one had previously had three interventions in other clinics. In general, there were 12 previous operations, including urethropexy with tension-free vaginal tape-obturator (TVT-O) (7/12), urethropexy with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) (1/12), laparoscopic Burch colposuspension (1/12) and urethropexy with a synthetic loop with unspecified approach (3/12). At the time of the first examination, the women used 2-6 pads per day. The following types of treatment were performed in our center: 5 patients underwent retropubic urethropexy with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and 4 patients had laparoscopic Burch colposuspension. In addition, 2 simultaneous laparoscopic revision of the Retzius space and TVT under laparoscopic guidance were performed as well as one simultaneous open Burch colposuspension and TVT. The median follow-up after surgery was 6 months. In two out of 10 patients (after primary TVT and TVT-O), laparoscopic Burch colposuspension was not effective. A recurrence of SUI was detected in the postoperative period. Then, the patients underwent revision of the Retzius space and TVT under laparoscopic guidance and open Burch colposuspension and TVT, respectively. Postoperatively, urinary continence was restored. Complete urinary continence (0 pads per day) was achieved in 50% of cases (6 out of 12 procedures). In three women (25%) mild SUI remained (2-4 points on the ICIQ-SF, 1 safety pad per day); at the same time, they noted a significant improvement in their quality of life. Thus, repeated interventions were effective in 75% of cases (9 out of 12). According to the evaluation of urination disorders (UDI-6), five patients had minor symptoms (1-3 points). Most of them complained of frequent urination that did not affect the quality of life. The efficiency of surgical treatment of recurrent SUI was 75%.

{"text": "Periorificial dermatitis (POD) is a facial skin rash often found in the oral commissures and nasolabial folds, and around the eyes. Treatment options include topical metronidazole and azelaic acid, and oral tetracycline-class antibiotics. While the broad-spectrum antibiotics are efficacious, they can lead to adverse gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, negatively impact gut flora, and lead to antibiotic resistance. Narrow-spectrum tetracyclines, such as sarecycline, have a low potential for promoting bacterial resistance and GI issues. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate sarecycline&rsquo;s efficacy and safety in treating POD. It was hypothesized that subjects with POD given a 4-week course of sarecycline would have improvement in their POD and tolerate the medication well. This was a single-center, prospective, pilot study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sarecycline for the treatment of POD with once-daily dosing over 4 consecutive weeks. Subjects were evaluated using the PODSI score at weeks 0, 2, and 4. All 9 subjects who completed the study had shown improvement in POD with no reported drug-related adverse events. All subjects were female, and the mean age was 41 years old. Sarecycline may be an appropriate novel treatment option for POD and should be explored further in a larger population study capturing this data. Furthermore, there is a need for more large-scale clinical studies evaluating treatment options for POD, with a focus on the impacts of antibiotic resistance and its implications on public health.

From the Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) database, we sourced comprehensive data on skin rash, lung cancer, and gene expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL). Drawing from this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis that integrated Mendelian Randomization (MR), protein-protein network analysis, and enrichment analysis to explore the causal relationship and potential mechanisms between rash and lung cancer.

However, no causal link between rash and lung cancer was found. Genetic analysis identified 3 genes positively associated with both conditions and 6 negatively associated, suggesting complex genetic interactions.

{"text": "The primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in adult patients admitted to a general adult intensive care unit (G-ICU) and a COVID-19 adult intensive care unit (C19-ICU). The secondary aims were to characterize patients in both ICUs; identify factors associated with the occurrence of ADRs; assess the performance of triggers in detecting ADRs; describe ADRs in terms of severity, mechanism, causality, and suspected drugs; and compare the trigger tool methodology with spontaneous reporting. This was a descriptive and retrospective study involving the application of triggers adapted from the Global Trigger Tool to identify ADRs through the analysis of physical and electronic medical records, medical prescriptions, and laboratory test results of adult patients admitted to the G-ICU and C19-ICU of a tertiary hospital in SumarÃ© (HES), SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, from January 2020 to December 2020. The patients were characterized by sex, age, length of stay, clinical outcome (discharge or death), and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. The performance of triggers in detecting ADRs was determined by calculating positive predictive value (PPV). ADRs were characterized by severity, mechanism, causality, and suspected drugs. The 2020 spontaneous reporting database at the HES was analyzed, and ADRs from the ICUs were identified. The study evaluated 135 patients (56.3% from the G-ICU and 43.7% from the C19-ICU), with a predominance of males (54.8%) and a mean age of 61.0 Â± 15.1 years. The mean hospital stay was 13.0 Â± 11.0 days, the average SOFA score throughout hospitalization was 8.4 Â± 3.8, and the ICU mortality rate was 69.6%. Of the 135 admitted patients, 55 (40.7%) presented with at least one ADR, of which 31 (52.5%) were admitted to the C19-ICU. The length of hospitalization was associated with the presence of ADR in both ICUs studied and age only in the C19-ICU. Additionally, patients admitted to the C19-ICU had a 2.4 times higher risk of developing ADRs. A total of 85 ADRs were identified, 65 (76.5%) of which occurred through triggers. The triggers with the best performance in detecting ADRs, with a PPV of 100%, were \"Partial Thromboplastin Time >50,\" \"Skin Rash,\" \"Protamine,\" and \"Hydroxyzine.\" Most ADRs were moderate (56.5%), Type A (96.5%), and classified as possible (64.7%). Insulin was the drug most frequently associated with ADRs, with 22 occurrences. Only five ADRs in ICU patients were spontaneously reported in 2020. Of all the patients, 40.7% experienced at least one ADR during hospitalization. The number of ADRs identified by the trigger tool was significantly higher than those reported spontaneously. This demonstrates that using triggers to investigate ADRs is an effective method to significantly enhance an institution's pharmacovigilance actions.", "entities": [{"entity": "DRUG", "start": 74, "end": 77, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "COVID-19", "start": 176, "end": 183, "matched_text": "COVID-19", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 236, "end": 239, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEVERITY", "start": 422, "end": 429, "matched_text": "SEVERITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "APPLICATION", "start": 605, "end": 615, "matched_text": "APPLICATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 983, "end": 985, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ORGAN", "start": 1063, "end": 1067, "matched_text": "ORGAN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PPV", "start": 1206, "end": 1208, "matched_text": "PPV", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "start": 2220, "end": 2233, "matched_text": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "start": 2220, "end": 2233, "matched_text": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SKIN RASH", "start": 2247, "end": 2255, "matched_text": "SKIN RASH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SKIN RASH", "start": 2247, "end": 2255, "matched_text": "SKIN RASH", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROTAMINE", "start": 2260, "end": 2268, "matched_text": "PROTAMINE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MODERATE", "start": 2306, "end": 2313, "matched_text": "MODERATE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INSULIN", "start": 2376, "end": 2382, "matched_text": "INSULIN", "type": "protein"}]}

A simple, specific, selective, and effective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for quantifying apalutamide and its active metabolite concentration in human plasma was developed and validated according to the FDA and EMA validation guidelines. A total of 24 patients diagnosed with desmoplasia-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC) were recruited. Blood samples were drawn after 4 weeks' administration of apalutamide at a dose of 180 mg once daily to ensure steady-state blood levels were achieved. Apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide were analysed by quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to measure the concentrations among individuals and the effect on the baseline level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and adverse events. The linear range, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery, carryover, and stability were appropriate according to the FDA and EMA validation guidelines. The apalutamide blood concentration range of the 24 patients was 0.517-7.27 Î¼g/mL, and the median value was 4.92 Î¼g/mL.

Fluconazole is an exceedingly rare cause of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, with only one previously reported case in abstract form. We present a case of a woman with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis who developed fluconazole-induced drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, presenting with an unusual clinical feature. A 19-year-old Hispanic woman was taking fluconazole for pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. A total of 30 days after starting fluconazole, she developed a generalized skin rash. Despite this, she continued taking the medication. Then 1 week later, she experienced facial swelling and a sensation of \"throat closing.\" She also developed fever, axillary lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and hepatitis. Fluconazole was discontinued, and she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which led to an overall improvement in her condition. During hospitalization, her antifungal therapy was switched to posaconazole. However, within 24 hours, she again experienced the \"throat closing\" sensation, which was relieved with an epinephrine injection. The patient was discharged on Day 6 with oral methylprednisolone. Again, 9 days after discharge, her symptoms recurred, including facial swelling and new skin rashes. She was readmitted and treated with famotidine, corticosteroids, and diphenhydramine. Her general condition and skin rashes gradually improved, with complete resolution of the rash 3 months after the initial eruption. We present a case of a woman with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis who developed drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome induced by fluconazole. Our case meets Bocquet's diagnostic criteria and is categorized as \"definite\" drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms by the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome is a T-cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction; however, our patient also exhibited a unique symptom-a sensation of \"throat closing\"-suggestive of angioedema and a Type I hypersensitivity component. This symptom appeared while she continued fluconazole after the onset of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and recurred upon the initiation of posaconazole. Although both fluconazole and posaconazole belong to the triazole antifungal class, true allergic cross-reactivity medicated by IgE is rare probably due to their structural differences.

{"text": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, life-threatening lung disease with a global incidence of 0.09-1.30 per 10,000 individuals. Pirfenidone and nintedanib are the approved treatments for IPF. This study evaluated the real-world safety and tolerability profiles of pirfenidone and nintedanib in IPF patients treated at the Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies (IRCCS ISMETT). A comparative analysis was conducted based on the number, types, and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and to identify potential predictors of treatment discontinuation or ADR onset based on patient characteristics. A retrospective observational study was conducted on 531 IPF patients treated at IRCCS ISMETT with either pirfenidone or nintedanib. Eligible patients were selected based on the logged monthly dispensations provided by the pharmacy service for both therapies. Covariates were extracted from electronic medical records (age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, comorbidities, forced vital capacity (FVC) %, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) %, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), polytherapy, oxygen therapy, drug switch, etc.). ADRs were categorized by severity and follow-up status, and further classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, specifying the Preferred Terms and the related System Organ Classes. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and univariate and multiple logistic regression identified potential risk factors for ADR onset. Backward Stepwise logistic regression (BSLR) was used to determine independent variables associated with ADR occurrence. The nintedanib group had more frequent ADRs related to gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disorders, with nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss as the most common. The pirfenidone group had more ADRs related to skin, nervous system, and vascular disorders, such as rash, nausea, dizziness, and blood pressure imbalances. Significant baseline differences between groups included age, smoking status, FVC (%), DLCO (%), and 6-MWT, with the nintedanib cohort showing worse baseline characteristics. A total of 450 ADRs were reported: 59.6% for nintedanib and 40.4% for pirfenidone. Independent variables that significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing ADR were drug change, treatment type, gender, and age. Identifying ADR predictors is essential for personalizing treatment strategies. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib are crucial in managing IPF, highlighting the need for further research to optimize personalized therapies and patient outcomes. Safety, tolerability and predictive factors of ADRs in IPF treatment Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, interstitial and life-threatening lung disease classified as a rare disease. Two medications, pirfenidone and nintedanib, are approved to slow the progression of IPF, but both can cause side effects. This study aimed to compare these treatments and identify factors that might predict which patients are more likely to experience side effects. Researchers at IRCCS ISMETT analyzed the medical records of 531 patients with IPF treated with pirfenidone or nintedanib over a period of eight years starting from May 2014. They looked at factors such as age, smoking history, lung function, and other health conditions to understand how these might influence the likelihood of side effects. The study found that patients taking nintedanib were more likely to experience digestive issues like nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. In contrast, patients on pirfenidone were more prone to skin rashes, dizziness, and changes in blood pressure. Overall, side effects were reported more frequently with nintedanib. Certain factors made side effects more likely: being older, taking nintedanib instead of pirfenidone, switching treatments, and gender, with men being less affected.

{"text": "Ticklishness is an idiosyncratic form of touch observed in multiple animal species, including humans. Although commonly regarded as trivial, it involves complex neurobiological mechanisms and diverse behavioral phenomena observed across species. Two distinct forms exist: knismesis, a mild tingling sensation elicited by gentle touch, and gargalesis, an intense sensation associated with involuntary laughter. Advocating the importance of clearly distinguishing these two types of ticklishness, this review synthesizes current knowledge on their neuronal underpinnings. Topics include somatosensory processing, self-tickling and sensory attenuation, emotional modulation, sociosexual dimensions, and evolutionary perspectives, among others. Special attention is given to the ambivalent nature of gargalesis, challenging conventional single-dimensional models of emotional valence. Ultimately, studying ticklishness provides a valuable opportunity to investigate playful emotional experiences from a naturalistic perspective, addressing fundamental yet underrepresented questions in contemporary neuroscience. Far from trivial, ticklishness thus provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying complex, context-dependent emotional and social experiences.", "entities": [{"entity": "MILD", "start": 286, "end": 289, "matched_text": "MILD", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TINGLING", "start": 291, "end": 298, "matched_text": "TINGLING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FAR", "start": 1110, "end": 1112, "matched_text": "FAR", "type": "protein"}]}

Experiment 1 showed that ASMR videos with combined audiovisual content elicited stronger tingling sensations than those with auditory-only content, suggesting an additive effect through sensory processing. In Experiment 2, we measured responses to ASMR and nature videos using finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and found that both types of videos reduced pulse rates compared to rest. Notably, ASMR videos caused a greater reduction in pulse rate than nature videos.

{"text": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. Research has shown that neuroinflammation, postoperative pain and autonomic nervous system dysfunction play significant roles in its onset. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has the potential to reduce inflammation, ease postoperative pain and aid in recovery by enhancing acetylcholine release and activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of transauricular VNS (ta-VNS) in preventing POD in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. This multicentre, participant-blinded and assessor-blinded, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial will compare the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing major surgery who receive ta-VNS versus sham stimulation. A total of 300 eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the active or sham stimulation group. The active stimulation group will receive electrical stimulation to the left cymba conchae at a frequency of 30 Hz and a pulse width of 250 Âµs, with a 30 s on/30 s off cycle. The intensity will start at 0.4V and be increased in 0.4V increments until a tingling sensation is felt, then adjusted to the highest tolerable level without pain. After obtaining informed consent and randomisation, the initial intervention will begin in the preoperative area and continue throughout the surgery. For the four postoperative days, the intervention will be administered twice daily in 2-hour sessions each morning and afternoon. The sham group will follow the same procedure, with electrodes placed on the left cymba conchae. After adjusting the stimulation intensity, the device will be switched off. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD from postoperative day 0 to day 7 or discharge. Secondary outcomes include the severity of POD, quality of recovery, sleep quality and adverse events. The protocol was approved by Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine on 9 January 2024 (Approval number: 20240014), and the trial was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 21 February 2024, prior to recruitment.

The subject began using earbuds while driving and during routine exercise. He reported suffering from nausea and temporary vertigo after head movements in the hours following the use of the earbuds. Physical exam findings during an acute episode of vertigo correlated to BPPV with positive Dix Hallpike, suggesting posterior semicircular canal BPPV in the right ear. The use of plug-ins was stopped. As a result of stopping the use of earbuds, the episodes of dizziness, tinnitus, and tingling sensations in the ear completely resolved. Attempting to find a replacement, he used bone-conduction headphones and did not experience any subsequent symptoms.

{"text": "Ergotism is a rare but potentially serious condition characterised by peripheral vasospasm. Its diagnosis is challenging because the presentation varies depending on the type and location of the affected blood vessels. Ergot alkaloids, including ergotamine, are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. Concurrent use of ergotamine with CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly increase the risk of ergotism. However, this potentially dangerous drug interaction is often underestimated in general practice. Herein, we report the case of a middle- aged woman with a history of migraine headaches, who was treated with Cafergot (ergotamine tartrate and caffeine). After the initiation of human immunodeficiency virus therapy with Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), she experienced recurrent episodes of bluish discoloration, livedo reticularis and tingling sensation in her upper and lower extremities over several years. Despite multiple hospital visits and extensive diagnostic workups, including normal blood investigations and biopsy, the correct diagnosis of ergotism-induced vasospasm due to ritonavir-ergotamine interaction was delayed. This diagnosis was supported by CT angiography, which demonstrated vasospasm of the femoral arteries. The patient's symptoms significantly resolved following ergotamine discontinuation. Ergotism is a self-limiting condition that can be fatal if not recognised and treated promptly. This case highlights the importance of awareness, particularly in primary care settings, on the potential drug interaction, principally in patients receiving drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as protease inhibitors.

{"text": "Jiedu Huoxue decoction (JHD), a classical Chinese herbal prescription that originated from Wang Qingren's Correction on the Errors of Medical Works, has been shown to be effective in treating acute kidney injury (AKI), yet the mechanism remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to probe the efficacy of JHD on AKI and clarify its potential mechanism in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. An integrated tactic, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, pharmacodynamics, molecular biology, and metabolomics, was employed to illuminate the pharmacological mechanisms of JHD in treating AKI. Firstly, network pharmacology was adopted to predict potential drug targets and molecular pathways of AKI by utilizing the active ingredients in JHD. Secondly, molecular docking was used to explore the affinity between the active ingredients of JHD and AKI targets. Thirdly, biochemical analysis and histopathology were performed to estimate JHD's impact on cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid/immunofluorescence staining, and untargeted metabolomics were performed to understand the underlying mechanisms in vivo. In silico analysis identified 184 active compounds and 394 targets of JHD. Topology analysis based on the PPI network indicated 7 main targets. The GO and KEGG enriched signaling pathways pointed to metabolic changes due to JHD's effects on AKI. Molecular docking screening revealed that TP53, SRC, MAPK1, MAPK2, and AKT1 were the key targets of JHD. Further molecular biology and untargeted metabolomics experiments revealed that fatty acid uptake (CD36) and lipogenesis (sphingolipids, phospholipids, and neutral lipids) mediated by the p53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway may be involved in the protective effects of JHD against AKI in vivo.

However, the detection rate of TP53 mutations in ctDNA of HGSOC patients has previously been shown to be inadequate. Given the prevalence of copy number aberrations (CNAs) in HGSOC, this study aimed to improve ctDNA detection by combining TP53 sequencing with shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS), and to evaluate the correlation with clinicopathological features and survival outcomes. This exploratory, retrospective cohort study included 53 advanced-stage HGSOC patients, comprising 18 treatment-naive patients and 35 patients treated with two neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles. TP53 targeted sequencing was integrated with sWGS (<5x coverage) for CNA estimation using ichor copy number aberration tumor fraction (ichorCNA TF). TP53 mutations were detected in 28 patients (52.8 %), and 17 patients (32.1 %) showed positive ichorCNA TF. Combining TP53 mutation detection with ichorCNA TF identified 62.3 % (n = 33) of patients as ctDNA-positive, showing a trend towards improved detection compared to TP53 mutation alone (p = .063). Treatment-naive patients exhibited higher TP53 mutation (72.2 % vs. 42.9 %, p = .043) and ichorCNA TF (66.7 % vs. 14.3 %, p < .001) detection rates compared to chemotherapy-treated patients. No correlations between ctDNA metrics and clinicopathological characteristics or survival outcomes were found. In conclusion, the integration of ichorCNA TF with TP53 mutation analysis showed a trend towards improved ctDNA detection in advanced-stage HGSOC patients.

{"text": "As a vascular-rich solid tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with poor transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) respone or treatment failure may correlate with tumor angiogenesis in residual disease. However, their relationship remains unclear. This study aims to explore the relationship between angiogenesis-related genes and TACE failure in patients with HCC and to develop a predictive model for assessing treatment outcomes. Somatic mutation profiles of 165 patients with HCC treated with TACE were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to calculate the genetic risk score (GRS) for angiogenesis-related gene mutations. The participants were randomly divided into training and validation groups. In the training set, independent prognostic factors of TACE-treated patients with HCC were screened using univariate Cox-LASSO-stepwise Cox regression, and a nomogram was established and evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis of the two sets. Among 165 patients, significant genetic alterations were identified, with TP53 being the most frequently mutated gene. Mutations in FGFR4, MST1R, and RECK were associated with the treatment efficacy of patients receiving TACE treatment, and the constructed GRS was associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, AFP, ALT, AST, PLR, PD-L1 immune drug treatment, and GRS were confirmed as independent factors affecting the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with TACE. A nomogram was constructed, which demonstrated excellent discrimination, calibration, and clinical benefits in both the training and validation sets. These findings highlight the critical role of angiogenesis-related genes in predicting TACE outcomes in patients with HCC and indicate that the developed prognostic model and nomogram can serve as valuable tools to predict prognosis based on the GRS of angiogenesis-associated gene mutations.

{"text": "This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), focusing specifically on the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligand, HB-EGF. Cryptococcal meningitis, caused by C. neoformans, has a high mortality rate and poses a significant threat to global public health. Research indicates that C. neoformans employs various strategies to cross the BBB, with transcellular transport being particularly critical. We observed that C. neoformans infection significantly upregulates the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Silencing EGFR using siRNA technology resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of C. neoformans to traverse the BMEC monolayer. Furthermore, C. neoformans infection also upregulates EGFR ligands, such as HB-EGF, in BMECs, thereby activating the EGFR signaling pathway. This activation involves the engagement of ADAM family metalloproteinases and the metalloprotease Mpr1 from C. neoformans.

{"text": "Lenvatinib serves as a first-line systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the development of resistance poses a major clinical challenge. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying lenvatinib resistance in HCC and identify potential interventions. We established lenvatinib-resistant HuH7 and Hep3B cell lines and conducted in vitro, bioinformatics, and biochemical assays to explore and validate the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to lenvatinib in HCC. Additionally, cellular xenograft models of lenvatinib-resistant HCC were utilized to assess tumor responses to a novel drug treatment regimen. Our findings revealed a shift from suppression to activation in the expression of p-ERK1/2 and Cyclin D1 in HCC cells as they transitioned from sensitivity to resistance to lenvatinib. Furthermore, we demonstrated that targeting ERK1/2 with ravoxertinib (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) could significantly enhance the sensitivity of resistant HCC cells to lenvatinib therapy. Through transcriptome data analysis and experimental validation, we identified amphiregulin (AREG), induced autocrinely by lenvatinib, as a critical mediator that activates the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, leading to increased Cyclin D1 expression in HCC cells. Mechanistically, lenvatinib promotes aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) nuclear translocation, directly activating AREG transcription. Using in vivo models, we further confirmed that inhibiting ERK1/2 with ravoxertinib or AHR with CH-223191 (an AHR inhibitor) could overcome lenvatinib resistance in HCC. Overall, lenvatinib-induced AHR activation promotes AREG expression, which subsequently facilitates the acquisition of drug resistance in HCC via the EGFR-ERK1/2-CyclinD1 signaling axis. Targeting ERK1/2 and AHR effectively improved the response to lenvatinib treatment in resistant HCC.", "entities": [{"entity": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "start": 65, "end": 88, "matched_text": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "start": 65, "end": 88, "matched_text": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 353, "end": 356, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 353, "end": 356, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 611, "end": 615, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 638, "end": 641, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ERK1", "start": 746, "end": 749, "matched_text": "ERK1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERK1", "start": 746, "end": 749, "matched_text": "ERK1", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN", "start": 757, "end": 762, "matched_text": "CYCLIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN", "start": 757, "end": 762, "matched_text": "CYCLIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AMPHIREGULIN", "start": 1107, "end": 1118, "matched_text": "AMPHIREGULIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AREG", "start": 1121, "end": 1124, "matched_text": "AREG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 1205, "end": 1208, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 1205, "end": 1208, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1217, "end": 1233, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN D1 EXPRESSION", "start": 1257, "end": 1276, "matched_text": "CYCLIN D1 EXPRESSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR", "start": 1329, "end": 1353, "matched_text": "ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AHR", "start": 1356, "end": 1358, "matched_text": "AHR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION", "start": 1361, "end": 1381, "matched_text": "NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1409, "end": 1421, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "start": 1713, "end": 1727, "matched_text": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "start": 1713, "end": 1727, "matched_text": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1765, "end": 1773, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Targeted therapies using EGFR-TKIs are fundamental treatment options for cases of lung adenocarcinoma harboring sensitizing mutations in EGFR. However, tumor progression to acquired resistance significantly hinders long-term efficacy. While the involvement of transcription factors in EGFR-TKI resistance has been extensively investigated, the contribution of transcriptional co-repressors like Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 1 (TLE1) remains largely unexplored. This study identifies TLE1 as a mediator of insensitivity to EGFR-TKI treatment in lung adenocarcinoma positive for EGFR mutation. Analysis of patient data indicated that elevated TLE1 level was associated with unfavorable survival outcomes among patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD, underscoring its clinical significance. In vitro, specifically in PC9 and HCC827 cells, exogenous TLE1 expression promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduced cellular response to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and osimertinib. Conversely, sole downregulation of endogenous TLE1 expression partially restored drug sensitivity in PC9GR and HCC827GR acquired resistance cell line models. At a mechanistic level, TLE1 functions as a co-repressor, interacting with ZEB1 to suppress E-cadherin expression, a key EMT marker, thereby facilitating resistance. This paper provides first evidence of TLE1 driven EMT-associated failure of EGFR-TKI treatment particularly in EGFR-mutant LUAD through its co-repressor activity. These results underscore the previously underappreciated role of transcriptional co-repressors in therapeutic resistance and position TLE1 as a promising prognostic and therapeutic target.

{"text": "The global prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has led to the practice of multiple treatments with antibiotics as the standard treatment strategy. However, antibiotic resistance has led to a decline in therapeutic effectiveness, prompting the exploration of innovative and eco-friendly antimicrobial agents. Microbial biosurfactants have gained attention because of their antibacterial activities, making them a good choice for treating various bacterial infections. Therefore, our study aimed to identify active biosurfactants, their potential targets, and the accompanying signaling pathways for the therapy of H. pylori using a network pharmacology approach. We selected twenty biosurfactants from the literature for further investigation. Our analysis identified 119 potential therapeutic targets for H. pylori infection out of the 706 putative targets of biosurfactants and the 913 disease-related targets. GO analysis revealed that these 119 targets were significantly enriched into multiple GO functional categories, such as cell proliferation, and inflammatory response regulation were prominently impacted. Further, through KEGG analysis, signaling pathways, such as the HIF-1 signaling pathway, coronavirus infection, and epithelial cell signaling in H. pylori infection. Protein-protein interaction analysis further revealed 25 core targets as potential targets in the network. Molecular docking was employed to validate the efficacy of biosurfactants against the supposed targets.

This study aimed to describe the impact of clinical and host factors including bilateral oophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation carriers. This cross-sectional study extends from a longitudinal observational study of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that has been ongoing since 1995. The Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among 752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test completion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, and was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host factors were collected from biennial research questionnaires. There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a high probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 vs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer prevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low probability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women with a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those with a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04). The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation carriers.

Furthermore, miR-1307 is a pro-apoptotic factor that inhibits BRCA1 by targeting the 3'UTR of the latter. In addition, the miR-1307 and BRCA1 axis can be activated by oxidative stress (OS), which is related to the transcriptional activation of miR-1307 by FoxO3, a transcription factor activated by OS.

Although large-scale NGS studies included mostly common invasive breast carcinomas, the genetic landscapes of several less common or rare special histologic types and other breast tumors have now also been elucidated. Many of these lesions harbor highly specific types of mutations or rearrangements/gene fusions, including invasive lobular carcinoma, tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity, most salivary gland-like neoplasms, fibroepithelial neoplasms, and mesenchymal tumors such as fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In some cases, surrogate immunohistochemical or RNA in situ hybridization markers evaluable by light microscopy have been shown to correlate with the underlying genetic alterations. Angiosarcomas and other special breast cancer subtypes, such as triple negative apocrine carcinomas, metaplastic carcinomas, and a subset of ER-positive carcinomas (mucinous and micropapillary carcinomas, neuroendocrine neoplasms) have not been associated with specific genetic underpinnings but are enriched for certain genetic features and oncogenic pathways. The identification of characteristic genetic alterations or their molecular surrogates can be useful to establish an accurate diagnosis, and in some cases, may point to potentially actionable therapeutic targets. This review aims to summarize the genetic landscapes of less common benign and malignant breast tumors, with special attention to genotype-phenotype correlations and to the diagnostic utility of genetics and surrogate markers when applicable.

Secondary objectives included progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as correlative testing, examining homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. The combination of gedatolisib and talazoparib carried manageable toxicities with a low incidence of grade 3 adverse events. The most common adverse events of all grades were anemia, fatigue, and oral mucositis. The ORR in the phase II study was 12%.

Additionally, it shows efficiency in terms of single sample sensitivity, maintaining 99% sensitivity compared to 99% for the Illumina prototype. We show that it also outreaches expected diagnostic parameters of MGI exome sequencing (99% vs 95% for WES). Per-amplicon coverage of sticky-end libraries sequenced on Illumina and MGI were highly correlated demonstrating that the platform itself does not introduce any bias to amplicon coverage.

Here we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is a component of the Kaiso enhanceosome that regulates gene transcription. Using proximal ligation assays, immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, luciferase assays and ChIP-seq experiments, we evaluated the association between BRCA1 and Kaiso. Kaiso nuclear extract immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Kaiso associates strongly with genes involved in RNA splicing and processing. When Kaiso was not crosslinked to DNA, BRCA1 was not detected among Kaiso-binding proteins. However, overexpression of BRCA1 increased Kaiso-mediated gene transcription in luciferase assays in a Kaiso-dependent manner. Comparison of BRCA1 ChIP-seq and Kaiso ChIP-seq data from HCT116 cells revealed both BRCA1 and Kaiso commonly bind to the promoters of 379 genes. The most enriched term associated with these genes where BRCA1 and Kaiso bind their promoters is metabolism of RNA.

This study aimed to describe the impact of clinical and host factors including bilateral oophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation carriers. This cross-sectional study extends from a longitudinal observational study of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that has been ongoing since 1995. The Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among 752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test completion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, and was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host factors were collected from biennial research questionnaires. There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a high probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 vs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer prevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low probability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women with a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those with a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04). The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation carriers.

{"text": "Approximately 10% of cases with gastric cancer (GC) exhibit familial clustering, however, only 1-3% of cases can be explained by two known hereditary syndromes: Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) caused by CDH1 and CTNNA1 pathogenic germline variants; and Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS), caused by germline variants in APC 1B promoter. Familial intestinal gastric cancer (FIGC) has been defined clinically, but it remains mostly genetically unexplained. Likewise, the heritability of mixed histology GC remains to be known. We aimed to estimate the frequency of known cancer predisposition gene variants in GC cases with and without a cancer family history, diverse histological subtypes, and varied age of onset. We evaluated the contribution of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in well-established moderate-to-high penetrance multi-organ cancer predisposition genes for GC risk in a large international multi-centre retrospective cohort study involving 750 patients with GC of early-onset or family history of cancer, either by panel sequencing or whole exome sequencing (WES). Panel sequencing was conducted on 328 cases, while WES was performed on the remaining 422. Tumour sequence analyses were performed on samples from 15 patients with P/LP variants. Mutations identified in five index cases were also tested in their relatives. We identified 45 patients (6%) with P/LP variants in: ATM (17 cases), BRCA2 (10 cases), MLH1 (five cases), TP53 (three cases), BRCA1, PALB2, RAD51D, and CHEK2 (two patients each), and RAD51C and PMS2 (one case each), all of which were mutually exclusive. The P/LP variant prevalence was higher in intestinal (9.8%) than in diffuse (4.3%) or mixed GC (4.5%) (p-value = 0.023), without difference per mutated gene by histological subtypes. Only 16 of the 45 patients who carried P/LP variants fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network genetic testing criteria of at least one cancer predisposition syndrome. Our findings indicate that a broader panel of cancer predisposition genes, beyond CDH1 and CTNNA1, should be included in gene panels to investigate germline variants in patients with GC. This would be especially beneficial when there is a family history of cancer, irrespective of histology subtype, as it would increase the chance of identifying patients who could benefit from risk reduction, targeted treatment, and surveillance of other cancer types.

Critical for cancer etiology and therapy resistance, the BRCA2 C terminus was thought to stabilize recombinogenic RAD51 after the assembly of ATP-extended RAD51 filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Here, the detailed crystal structure of the human BRCA2 C-terminal interaction domain (TR2 interface [TR2i]) complexed with ATP-bound RAD51 prior to DNA binding instead reveals TR2i unexpectedly induces a unique ATP-RAD51 dimer conformation that accommodates nucleation onto double-stranded B-DNA unsuited for HDR initiation. Structural, biochemical, and molecular results with interface-guided mutations uncover TR2i's FP mechanism. Proline-driven secondary structure stabilizes residue triads and spans the RAD51 dimer, engaging pivotal interactions of RAD51 M210 and BRCA2 S3291/P3292, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation site that toggles between FP during S phase and HDR in G2.

{"text": "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare and aggressive cancer of the biliary tract with a very low survival rate. The availability of diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for its management is limited. The study identifies potential genetic biomarkers of GBC by analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through microarray profiling and constructing regulatory networks using systems biology techniques. We used Clariomâ¢ D Array in gallbladder cancer, cholelithiasis, and normal tissues (10 cases in each group), identifying DEGs and key biological pathways. Functional analysis via Metascape, DisGeNET, and KEGG-SIGNOR network mapping revealed gene-disease relationships and protein interactions. There were 3,898 significant DEGs (|Fold Change| > 2.0, p < 0.05) identified in GBC compared to normal gallbladder tissue, with 2,575 genes upregulated and 1,323 downregulated. On comparison with cholelithiasis, 2523 DEGs (|Fold Change|>2.0, p < 0.05) were upregulated and 1451 downregulated. The functional analyses have shown that these DEGs were mainly involved in anatomical structure maturation and cell-cycle regulation. Top ten identified hub genes were XAB2, XPA, RPA1, RAD51B, RPS27A, BRCA2, ATR, PDS5B, CCNB2 and RANBP2.

{"text": "The genotoxic drug doxorubicin (Dox) remains one of the most powerful chemotherapeutic options available for a wide range of cancers including breast, ovarian, and other cancers. However, emerging evidence links Dox treatment with chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, a condition that is popularly referred to as Dox-induced neurotoxicity or \"chemobrain\", which limits the use of the drug. There are no specific treatments for Dox-induced neurotoxicity, only interventions to mitigate the neurotoxic effects of the drug. Accumulating evidence indicates that DNA damage, oxidative stress, dysregulation of autophagy and neurogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis play central roles in Dox-induced neurotoxicity. Additionally, germline mutations in the tumour suppressor genes breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and related cancers. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are distinct proteins that play crucial, unique roles in homologous recombination-mediated double-stranded break repair. Furthermore, BRCA1 and 2 mitigate oxidative stress in both neural cells and brain microvascular endothelial cells, which suggests that they have a critical role as regulators of pathways central to the development of Dox-induced neurotoxicity. Despite research on the effects of Dox on cognitive function, there is a gap in knowledge about the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Dox-induced neurotoxicity.

{"text": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains associated with limited effective pharmacological treatment options. This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets for LUAD through the integration and analysis of multi-omics datasets. A meta-analysis was conducted using two extensive proteomics datasets, the UK Biobank Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) and the Fenland study, to identify disease-associated targets for LUAD through the Summary-Data-Based Mendelian Randomization method. Sensitivity analysis, including heterogeneity tests for dependent instruments, were conducted to validate the findings. The prognostic relevance of the identified candidate targets was assessed using transcriptomic data. Functional interactions were explored via protein-protein interaction network analysis, while single-cell analyses were employed to determine cell-specific expression patterns and differentiation trajectories. Potential side effects and therapeutic indications of these targets were evaluated using phenome-wide association studies and pharmacological data mining. Following meta-analysis, a primary significant target, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5), along with potential targets FUT8 and KLK13, were identified as therapeutic candidates for LUAD. FUT8 demonstrated a positive association with LUAD risk (OR = 1.02, p = 0.049), while ICAM5 (OR = 0.88, p = 0.002) and KLK13 (OR = 0.85, p = 0.021) exhibited negative associations. ICAM5 was further identified as an independent prognostic factor for patient survival (HR: 0.788, 95% CI: 0.663-0.936, p = 0.007) and revealed significant diagnostic and prognostic utility in LUAD. ICAM5 expression correlated with various immune infiltration patterns, suggesting potential modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.

{"text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited responsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or recurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an indolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the repurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to improve outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes evidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG 281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, molecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer provide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies demonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 inhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the response to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and endocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited treatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates precise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies leveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical for refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National Comprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients with hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer.", "entities": [{"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 31, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 31, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RECURRENT", "start": 156, "end": 164, "matched_text": "RECURRENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GROWTH PATTERN", "start": 240, "end": 253, "matched_text": "GROWTH PATTERN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE", "start": 280, "end": 311, "matched_text": "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KRAS", "start": 334, "end": 337, "matched_text": "KRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRAF", "start": 340, "end": 343, "matched_text": "BRAF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NRAS", "start": 346, "end": 349, "matched_text": "NRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4", "start": 579, "end": 603, "matched_text": "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CDK4", "start": 608, "end": 611, "matched_text": "CDK4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 753, "end": 765, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 753, "end": 765, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 820, "end": 825, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 820, "end": 825, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 916, "end": 923, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN", "start": 1043, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 1261, "end": 1263, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "start": 1324, "end": 1340, "matched_text": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR", "start": 1342, "end": 1362, "matched_text": "PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "start": 1395, "end": 1410, "matched_text": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 1780, "end": 1789, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOPE", "start": 2581, "end": 2584, "matched_text": "HOPE", "type": "protein"}]}

Here we investigate IDO-1 expression in 2 cohorts of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, both in tumor cells and in immune infiltrate, with correlation of IDO-1 to PD-L1 expression, clinical patient demographics and outcomes. Evaluation first utilized an exploratory cohort of 259 NSCLC samples obtained from 122 patients followed by a second validating cohort of 1,200 NSCLC samples obtained from 437 patients. All tumor samples were collected from patients who underwent surgical lung resections. IDO-1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Correlations were assessed using Spearman and Kendall tests. A Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was used to assess if overall survival (OS) was associated with IDO-1 positivity in univariate and multivariable settings. In the validating cohort of 437 patients IDO-1 expression was positive in 111 (25.4%) with an H-Score â¥ 1. IDO-1 expression was determined to be greater in tumor immune infiltrate, with 406 patients (93.8%) determined as positive. Both continuous and binary versions of tumor H-Score showed a significant positive correlation with the amount of tumor immune infiltrate (0.1806 and 0.1698, p < 0.0001). None of the analyzed variables (age, sex, histology, stage, EGFR, KRAS and PD-L1 status) were found to display a significant correlation with IDO-1 positivity in tumor and immune cells.

This review details significant milestones of KRAS-targeted drug discovery and the current impediments in this field. The identification of covalent inhibitors of the KRAS G12C and more recently a direct inhibitor of K-Ras G12C in a GTP-bound state exemplifies the promise of this approach. Structure-guided drug design improved the basis for understanding the mutations in KRAS, notably at codon 12, and the idea has potential for gene therapy.

These inhibitors either covalently target the G12C mutant or reversibly target other mutants by binding in a transient pocket known as the switch-II pocket. Covalent inhibitors bound KRAS-GDP with K", "entities": [{"entity": "RAS", "start": 1, "end": 3, "matched_text": "RAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KRAS", "start": 60, "end": 63, "matched_text": "KRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 103, "end": 106, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 323, "end": 330, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 323, "end": 330, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 367, "end": 373, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSIENT", "start": 533, "end": 541, "matched_text": "TRANSIENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GDP", "start": 612, "end": 614, "matched_text": "GDP", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "KRAS is a prominent oncogene mutated in a large number of human malignancies, particularly in pancreatic, colorectal, and lung tumors. We demonstrate here that KRAS, including its various activating mutants, is subjected to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation in cancer cells. Through a siRNA-based screening of deubiquitinases, we identified USP25 as a deubiquitinase for KRAS. Depleting USP25 expression increases ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of KRAS, leading to the suppression of its oncogenic activity. We further show that USP25 inhibitors we have discovered are capable of destabilizing KRAS in cancer cells and are efficacious in blocking tumor xenograft growth in mice. These findings provide evidence supporting the notion that targeting the deubiquitinase USP25 can effectively, albeit indirectly, suppress KRAS and potentially aid in the treatment of tumors driven by KRAS activating mutations.", "entities": [{"entity": "KRAS", "start": 1, "end": 4, "matched_text": "KRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 43, "end": 47, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 123, "end": 126, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 225, "end": 233, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 225, "end": 233, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 256, "end": 266, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 271, "end": 276, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 271, "end": 276, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "USP25", "start": 351, "end": 355, "matched_text": "USP25", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEUBIQUITINASE", "start": 362, "end": 375, "matched_text": "DEUBIQUITINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEUBIQUITINASE", "start": 362, "end": 375, "matched_text": "DEUBIQUITINASE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 695, "end": 698, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 724, "end": 731, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AID", "start": 861, "end": 863, "matched_text": "AID", "type": "protein"}]}

This review explores how IR promotes amyloidogenesis by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis and enhancing Amyloid beta (AÎ²) production and aggregation. Specifically, we examine the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in cholesterol homeostasis along with their impact on insulin signaling pathways, highlights how their dysregulation can lead to IR, a significant contributor to the development of amyloidogenesis, a key factor in causing NDDs. We explore the novel molecular mechanisms linking IR and AÎ² aggregation, focusing on the interplay between ABC transporters and Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Furthermore, we also explore emerging evidence linking ABC transporters to oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction critical factors in the development of amyloidogenesis. Additionally, this review also discusses potential therapeutic strategies targeting ABC transporters to mitigate IR and reduce amyloid burden by various mechanisms including Insulin receptors/IRS-1 signaling, Phosphatidylinositol3kinase-Protein kinase-B (PI3K/AKT), Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE), Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), Glucose transporters (GLUTs), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), Adiponectin, Mitochondrial dysfunctioning, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) Wingless-related integration site/beta-catenin (Wnt/Î²-catenin) and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1).

{"text": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by a complicated interaction of lipotoxicity and inflammation in the liver, yet the mechanisms linking these phenomena remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from macrophages into palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxic hepatoma cells. By co-culturing macrophages with lipotoxic Huh7 cells in a transwell system, we demonstrated that PA-treated Huh7 cells exhibited impaired uptake of macrophage-derived EVs. Compared with control Huh7 cells, PA-treated Huh7 cells presented a reduction in the expression of macrophage-derived microRNA-223 (miR-223) after co-culture, accompanied by an increase in the expression of miR-223 target genes. Further analysis revealed that upon PA treatment, the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in Huh7 cells and EV uptake activity were simultaneously diminished. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments of LDLR in Huh7 cells revealed a crucial role of LDLR in facilitating EV uptake. Mechanistically, we elucidated that PA induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequently stimulated proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-mediated LDLR degradation. Administration of a PCSK9 inhibitor rescued LDLR levels and increased EV uptake in PA-treated Huh7 cells from macrophages. Moreover, we found that the uptake of macrophage-derived EVs lacking apolipoprotein E (ApoE) by Huh7 cells was lower than that of control EVs, highlighting the role of ApoE as a facilitator of EV transfer from macrophages into Huh7 cells. Overall, our study highlights the intricate mechanisms underlying EV-mediated communication between macrophages and Huh7 cells during lipotoxicity and provides insight into the development of EV-based therapies for MASLD.", "entities": [{"entity": "METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION-ASSOCIATED STEATOTIC LIVER DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 56, "matched_text": "METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION-ASSOCIATED STEATOTIC LIVER DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 132, "end": 143, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 132, "end": 143, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 152, "end": 156, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UPTAKE", "start": 281, "end": 286, "matched_text": "UPTAKE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EXTRACELLULAR", "start": 291, "end": 303, "matched_text": "EXTRACELLULAR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HEPATOMA", "start": 387, "end": 394, "matched_text": "HEPATOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MACROPHAGE", "start": 552, "end": 561, "matched_text": "MACROPHAGE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MIR", "start": 708, "end": 710, "matched_text": "MIR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR", "start": 873, "end": 904, "matched_text": "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LDLR", "start": 907, "end": 910, "matched_text": "LDLR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1062, "end": 1065, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "start": 1149, "end": 1169, "matched_text": "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROPROTEIN CONVERTASE SUBTILISIN/KEXIN TYPE 9", "start": 1206, "end": 1250, "matched_text": "PROPROTEIN CONVERTASE SUBTILISIN/KEXIN TYPE 9", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PCSK9", "start": 1253, "end": 1257, "matched_text": "PCSK9", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 1274, "end": 1284, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APOLIPOPROTEIN E", "start": 1479, "end": 1494, "matched_text": "APOLIPOPROTEIN E", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOE", "start": 1497, "end": 1500, "matched_text": "APOE", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been implicated as a risk for developing lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) applied for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, there is a paucity of cases reported with histopathological CAA diagnosis in this setting, with a single report to imply the role of CAA-related inflammation (CAA-RI). We report clinical, radiological, and neuropathological observations of a 65-year-old woman who presented with acute left-hemispheric symptoms with an initially unrevealing cranial computed tomography (CT) and received IVT for presumed AIS. The course was rapidly complicated by a huge lobar ICH and a fatal outcome. The autopsy revealed severe CAA, unexpectedly with transmural CAA-RI, a.k.a. amyloid-Î²-related angiitis (ABRA), and histopathological evidence for vascular amyloid-Î² phagocytosis. Re-evaluation of initial imaging did not reveal signs of asymmetric confluent white matter edema characteristic of CAA-RI, but raised the suspicion of a tiny left central convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage, a substrate of amyloid spells. The genotype of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene (ApoE) was Îµ3/Îµ3. Being the second published thrombolysis-associated fatality with ABRA and among the few with definite CAA, the present case confirms CAA/CAA-RI to be a potential hidden risk for IVT-associated ICHs, urging for awareness of CAA-associated pathologies and clinical-radiological hints in an AIS setting. The findings implicate the relevance of vascular AÎ² phagocytosis in the pathogenesis, confirm that CAA-RI may present without prominent edema, highlight that CAA/CAA-RI-related focal neurological deficits (including amyloid spells) can be potential AIS mimics within the IVT time window, and urge for rigorous analysis of pre-IVT CT scans for even subtle sulcal hyperdensities suggesting cSAH/amyloid spell in elderly patients, prompting consideration of magnetic resonance imaging.", "entities": [{"entity": "CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY", "start": 1, "end": 27, "matched_text": "CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY", "start": 1, "end": 27, "matched_text": "CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE", "start": 86, "end": 109, "matched_text": "INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE", "start": 86, "end": 109, "matched_text": "INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ICH", "start": 112, "end": 114, "matched_text": "ICH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ISCHEMIC STROKE", "start": 172, "end": 186, "matched_text": "ISCHEMIC STROKE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AIS", "start": 189, "end": 191, "matched_text": "AIS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 329, "end": 332, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 349, "end": 360, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 349, "end": 360, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ANGIITIS", "start": 785, "end": 792, "matched_text": "ANGIITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ANGIITIS", "start": 785, "end": 792, "matched_text": "ANGIITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ABRA", "start": 795, "end": 798, "matched_text": "ABRA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 824, "end": 831, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PHAGOCYTOSIS", "start": 857, "end": 868, "matched_text": "PHAGOCYTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 904, "end": 906, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EDEMA", "start": 962, "end": 966, "matched_text": "EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EDEMA", "start": 962, "end": 966, "matched_text": "EDEMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TINY", "start": 1024, "end": 1027, "matched_text": "TINY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 1034, "end": 1040, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE", "start": 1052, "end": 1074, "matched_text": "SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "APOLIPOPROTEIN E", "start": 1128, "end": 1143, "matched_text": "APOLIPOPROTEIN E", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOE", "start": 1146, "end": 1149, "matched_text": "APOE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1152, "end": 1155, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1152, "end": 1155, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 1551, "end": 1562, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FOCAL", "start": 1656, "end": 1660, "matched_text": "FOCAL", "type": "symptom"}]}

This study seeks to elucidate genetic factors affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in blood, enabling development of personalised strategies for lipid management and cardiovascular disease prevention. GenePy, a gene pathogenicity scoring tool, condenses genetic variant data into a single burden score for both individuals and genes. GenePy scores were evaluated across all genes to assess their association with blood cholesterol levels, excluding participants on cholesterol-lowering medications. Nonparametric tests analysed the relationship between GenePy scores and cholesterol levels in those aged < 60 years and â¥ 60 years. GenePy was effective in identifying PCSK9, APOE, and LDLR as the genes most critically influencing plasma cholesterol at a population level. Of note, the strongest genetic effect observed was a protective loss of function effect in the PCSK9 gene. Novel significant signals driving blood LDL-C levels that are common to both age groups include: BPIFB6 that has a role in lipid binding and transport; FAIM that has a role in regulation of lipogenesis, SLAMF9 previously implicated in macrophage cholesterol loading; CLU-a component of HDL; SAA1 with a known role in cholesterol homeostasis. A gene-based analysis integrating common, rare, and private variations identifies genes influencing blood LDL-C levels.

{"text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous disease with variable clinical and molecular features. Studies have highlighted the significant role of Î³Î´ T cells in the survival of leukemia patients. However, the heterogeneity of Î³Î´ T cells and their impact on clinical correlation in the peripheral blood of patients with DLBCL remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed on 9 blood samples, sourced from 6 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 3 healthy individuals (HIs), to delineate clinically pertinent Î³Î´ T cell states and subsets in DLBCL patients. Flow cytometry was then employed to validate the relationship between DLBCL prognosis and Î³Î´ T cell subsets. Our study integrated genetic drivers through consensus clustering, leading to the identification of 6 distinct Î³Î´ T cell subsets in DLBCL and HIs. These subsets include a naÃ¯ve Î³Î´ T cell subset characterized by TCF7 and LEF1 expression, a memory Î³Î´ T cell subset sharing common genes such as GZMK, IL7R, an anti-tumor Î³Î´ T cell subset with overexpression of IFNG, TNF, and CD69, and two subsets exhibiting TIGIT overexpression indicative of an exhausted Î³Î´ T cell phenotype. Additionally, a cytotoxic Î³Î´ T cell subset marked by increased NKG7 and GZMB levels was identified. Our results revealed that while Î³Î´ T cells possess anti-tumor capacities, their functional effectiveness is diminished due to differentiation into exhausted subpopulations. Several clusters with high cytotoxicity scores also showed elevated exhaustion scores (C13-Î³Î´-TIGIT.1, C14-Î³Î´-TIGIT.2), suggesting the presence of a population in DLBCL samples that is simultaneously exhausted and cytotoxic. In particular, the TIGIT.2 Î³Î´ T cell subset manifests a more pronounced exhaustion score relative to TIGIT.1 Î³Î´ T cell subset, indicating differential levels of cellular exhaustion among these groups. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between high expression of TIGIT Î³Î´ T cell subsets and poorer patient prognoses. We also discovered unique expression profiles within these subgroups: TIGIT.1 Î³Î´ T cells are marked by elevated CXCR4 expression, contrasting with the TIGIT.2 Î³Î´ T cell subgroup which exhibits increased CX3CR1 expression. Pseudotime analysis implies a potential differentiation trajectory from naÃ¯ve and GZMK Î³Î´ T cells to various terminally differentiated subsets, with genes associated with stemness (e.g., TCF-1) subsequently downregulated. These findings suggest that TIGIT.2 subset may be further along in the differentiation trajectory, potentially representing a more terminally differentiated state than TIGIT.1 subset. According to our clinical validation cohort, the TIGIT We identified genetic subtypes of Î³Î´ T cells with distinct genotypic and clinical characteristics in DLBCL patients. Expression levels within these subgroups emerged as potential indicators for patient outcomes and as crucial factors in shaping therapeutic strategies. These insights significantly advance our understanding of intricate relationships among cellular subgroups and their roles in influencing disease progression and patient prognosis.", "entities": [{"entity": "DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA", "start": 1, "end": 29, "matched_text": "DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 65, "end": 71, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 161, "end": 164, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LEUKEMIA", "start": 201, "end": 208, "matched_text": "LEUKEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LEUKEMIA", "start": 201, "end": 208, "matched_text": "LEUKEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PERIPHERAL", "start": 311, "end": 320, "matched_text": "PERIPHERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 322, "end": 326, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 374, "end": 377, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 374, "end": 377, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 379, "end": 381, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 379, "end": 381, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "T CELL", "start": 578, "end": 583, "matched_text": "T CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TCF7", "start": 950, "end": 953, "matched_text": "TCF7", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LEF1", "start": 959, "end": 962, "matched_text": "LEF1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MEMORY", "start": 978, "end": 983, "matched_text": "MEMORY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GZMK", "start": 1033, "end": 1036, "matched_text": "GZMK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL7R", "start": 1039, "end": 1042, "matched_text": "IL7R", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 1053, "end": 1057, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "IFNG", "start": 1101, "end": 1104, "matched_text": "IFNG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TNF", "start": 1107, "end": 1109, "matched_text": "TNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CD69", "start": 1116, "end": 1119, "matched_text": "CD69", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TIGIT", "start": 1149, "end": 1153, "matched_text": "TIGIT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PHENOTYPE", "start": 1209, "end": 1217, "matched_text": "PHENOTYPE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NKG7", "start": 1285, "end": 1288, "matched_text": "NKG7", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GZMB", "start": 1294, "end": 1297, "matched_text": "GZMB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXHAUSTION", "start": 1565, "end": 1574, "matched_text": "EXHAUSTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CXCR4", "start": 2175, "end": 2179, "matched_text": "CXCR4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CXCR4", "start": 2175, "end": 2179, "matched_text": "CXCR4", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CX3CR1", "start": 2268, "end": 2273, "matched_text": "CX3CR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TCF-1", "start": 2477, "end": 2481, "matched_text": "TCF-1", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "\"Li medicine\" Ganoderma calidophilum is a rare and unique medicinal fungus native to Hainan, China, traditionally used to relieve stomach pain and treat gastric diseases. However, its medicinal applications lack scientific validation despite its prominent role in ethnomedicine. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of G. calidophilum extract against gastric ulcer (GU), isolate its main bioactive compound (GDA), and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action. In vivo, acute gastric mucosal-injured mice were observed for mucosal symptoms, and levels of IL-6, TNF-Î±, SOD, and MDA were measured. In vitro, ethanol-damaged GES-1 cells were used to test the effects of G. calidophilum extract and GDA. 28 compounds were isolated from the extract, and network pharmacology and molecular docking studied GDA influence on ALOX5 and NF-ÎºB. The extract improved mouse symptoms regulated inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. GDA, the key anti-inflammatory compound, repaired cell damage, reduced inflammation and oxidative stress.

{"text": "Wenxia Changfu formula (WCF), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has shown therapeutic potential for treating lung cancer in clinical practice. Metastasis is the main cause of mortality in lung cancer patients, reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represents a promising strategy. This study aims to investigate the effects of WCF on metastasis of Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. RAW264.7 cells were differentiated into M2 macrophages, and conditioned medium from macrophages with different interventions was used to culture LLC cells. The effects of WCF on tumor migration and invasion were evaluated. Specific markers of macrophage polarization, non-targeted metabolomics, lipid content, and the PPAR-Î³/CD36 pathway in macrophages were analyzed. To investigate the in vivo effects of WCF on metastasis, a mouse model was established using LLC-luciferase (LLC-Luc) cells, macrophages were depleted upon clodronate liposome administration. WCF effectively inhibited M2-like polarization of macrophages, as evidenced by reduced expression of CD206 and Arg-1, while promoting M1-like polarization, with increased expression of CD86, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î±. These changes were correlated with decreased migration and invasion of LLC cells. In vivo, WCF treatment significantly decreased the fluorescence intensity of LLC-Luc cells, with no significant difference observed between WCF and clodronate liposome interventions. Furthermore, WCF regulated fatty acid metabolism, decreased lipid accumulation, and suppressed the PPAR-Î³/CD36 pathway in M2 macrophages. WCF inhibits the metastasis of LLC cells by reprogramming TAMs, mediated by the PPAR-Î³/CD36 pathway and fatty acid metabolism.", "entities": [{"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 115, "end": 125, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 115, "end": 125, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 167, "end": 170, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 230, "end": 234, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 310, "end": 313, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LLC", "start": 385, "end": 387, "matched_text": "LLC", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION", "start": 683, "end": 705, "matched_text": "MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIPID", "start": 735, "end": 739, "matched_text": "LIPID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PPAR", "start": 758, "end": 761, "matched_text": "PPAR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CD36", "start": 766, "end": 769, "matched_text": "CD36", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CD206", "start": 1102, "end": 1106, "matched_text": "CD206", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ARG", "start": 1112, "end": 1114, "matched_text": "ARG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CD86", "start": 1186, "end": 1189, "matched_text": "CD86", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-1", "start": 1192, "end": 1195, "matched_text": "IL-1", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TNF", "start": 1204, "end": 1206, "matched_text": "TNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INTENSITY", "start": 1358, "end": 1366, "matched_text": "INTENSITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FATTY ACID METABOLISM", "start": 1504, "end": 1524, "matched_text": "FATTY ACID METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Jianwei Yuyang Tablet (JWYY), a Chinese herbal formulation, has been approved for the treatment of various gastric diseases in clinic and has demonstrated significant therapeutic effects in patients with multiple types of gastric ulcers (GU). This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of JWYY on alcohol-induced gastric ulcers in mice and to explore the potential mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects. Gastric ulcers were induced in male C57/BL6J mice through a single oral dose of 10 ml/kg alcohol. The extent of gastric mucosal injury was evaluated using ulcer index (UI) and histopathological examinations. Additionally, the levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) and network pharmacology were used to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of JWYY in the treatment of GU. Changes in potential hub genes and pathways related to the therapeutic effects of JWYY were assessed using western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence analyses. The protective effects of potential active ingredients were evaluated in vitro models. The administration of JWYY significantly decrease the UI and alleviated gastric hemorrhagic necrosis, submucosal edema, and destruction of epithelial cells in mouse model of GU. JWYY markedly suppressed IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and MDA levels, and restored mucosal integrity (ZO-1 expression). RNA-seq revealed dual roles of JWYY, including the inhibition of JAK2-STAT3/NF-ÎºB pathways to attenuate inflammation and the rescue of activation of PI3K-AKT/DNA repair pathways to enhance cell survival. Network pharmacology and UPLC-MS/MS identified quercetin, morin, naringenin, catechin as key bioactive components, which bind to JAK2/PDGFRA, decreased inflammation, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis in vitro. This study deciphers the multi-target, multi-pathway mechanisms underline the JWYY in the treatment of alcohol-induced GU, integrating TCM principles with modern pharmacology. The identified bioactive components and pathways provide a scientific foundation for clinical usage of JWYY and indicated the important of targeting JAK-STAT/NF-ÎºB signaling in the treatment of GU.

{"text": "Prolonged inhalation of environmental dust leads to the onset of life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis. Identifying therapeutic targets and drugs for this disease is of critical urgency. However, traditional drug discovery often overlooks cell communication signals. Here, our single-cell omics data and in vivo experiments of the murine coal pneumoconiosis model revealed that a subpopulation of neutrophils with high expression of S100a8 enhanced the communication between neutrophils and macrophages. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that inhibiting S100a8 could mitigate coal dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we employed Paquinimod, an S100a8 inhibitor. Our data demonstrated that Paquinimod alleviated coal dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis by blocking the neutrophil-S100a8-Tlr4-macrophage signaling axis, suppressing the Tlr4/p38MAPK/NF-ÎºB pathway, lowering phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK and NF-ÎºB p65. These inhibitions reduced inflammatory factors (TNF-Î±) and fibrotic markers (Î±-SMA, Fibronectin, TGF-Î²1), slowing fibrosis progression and improving lung function. Furthermore, the neutralization effect of recombinant S100a8 protein on Paquinimod's efficacy underscored the pivotal role of neutrophil-S100a8-Tlr4-macrophage communication. In conclusion, our study elucidates the critical role of S100a8 in coal dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis and highlights the potential of S100a8 inhibition by Paquinimod as a therapeutic strategy.

The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of Withania Somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS) as a chemoprophylactic and immunomodulatory agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a 12 week, randomized, open label, parallel group, two arm, comparative, multicentric, controlled trial compared WS with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in health care workers (HCWs). Total 400 HCWs were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either oral WS (500 mg for 12 weeks) or HCQ 400 mg (for 7 weeks). The primary outcome was to establish equivalence between WS and HCQ for the proportion of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven participants contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection: 5 in WS arm and 2 in HCQ arm. The equivalence between WS and HCQ was established for the proportion difference of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection for per-protocol (PP) (1.6%, 95% CI: -1.08%-4.33%) and in subgroup analysis (ITT, mIIT, non-vaccinated and seronegative). Notably, the immunomodulatory effect of WS stood scientifically validated by the statistically significant difference in cytokine levels (p < 0.0001) at 12 weeks compared to baseline for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were most frequent (53 in WS and 58 in HCQ). Headache and sneezing were observed only with HCQ. Participant global assessment showed excellent tolerability with both treatment arms. WS was found equivalent to HCQ as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 infection with no safety concern.

{"text": "Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current therapeutic approaches for ischemic stroke are limited, particularly in targeting the interconnected mechanisms of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. There is a critical need for effective neuroprotective agents that address these pathways to mitigate I/R-induced injury. Here, we used bioinformatics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ischemic stroke and performed enrichment analysis to uncover hub genes and signaling pathways central to disease progression. MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, was identified as a promising candidate and investigated for its neuroprotective efficacy in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) models. MG-132 treatment significantly reduced infarct size, decreased cerebral edema, and improved neurological outcomes. Mechanistically, MG-132 downregulated PTGS2 expression, inhibited NF-ÎºB activation, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-17. Furthermore, MG-132 alleviated oxidative stress and apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and fewer TUNEL-positive cells. These findings demonstrate that MG-132 exerts robust neuroprotection by modulating the PTGS2/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, addressing key pathological processes in I/R injury.

{"text": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic vascular disease characterized by failure to resolve inflammation and forming plaque within the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis and its related cardiovascular diseases are the major causes of death worldwide. Our previous preliminary study showed that anthocyanin-rich extract (ACNE) from Xinjiang wild cherry plum (Prunus divaricata Ledeb) fruit peels exhibited anti-atherosclerotic effect. However, the potential mechanism of this health-beneficial effect remains unclear. Here, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was used to tentatively address this issue. The ACNE mainly contains cyanidin, cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy3Glu), Cyanidin 3-(6''-acetylglucoside) (Cy3AcGlu), cyanidin 3-galactoside (Cy3Gal), cyanidin 3-xyloside (Cy3Xyl), and cyanidin 3-rutinoside (Cy3Rut). Seven key targets, EGFR, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, SRC, HIF1A, CXCR4 and IGF1R were identified from core protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Anthocyanins interacting on key targets were initially demonstrated by molecular docking, particularly Cy3Rut and Cy3Xyl having highest affinity with most key targets. Biological function analysis suggested that key targets were involved in several biological processes, including positive regulation of cell migration, positive regulation of phosphorylation, inflammatory response, response to hypoxia, etc. The significantly enriched pathways, such as HIF-1 signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, macrophage stimulating protein MSP signaling network map, were closely related to atherosclerosis. Altogether, based on the comprehensive analysis and discussion, we revealed that TLR4/EGFR and IGF1R-CXCL12/CXCR4 pathways were at least partially implicated in the anti-atherosclerotic effects of anthocyanins through affecting inflammation, endothelial homeostasis, and foam cell formation. This study served as a theoretical basis for further validating the underlying anti-atherosclerotic mechanism of anthocyanins via in vitro and in vivo experiments.", "entities": [{"entity": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "start": 1, "end": 15, "matched_text": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "start": 1, "end": 15, "matched_text": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 22, "end": 28, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VASCULAR DISEASE", "start": 30, "end": 45, "matched_text": "VASCULAR DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 83, "end": 94, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 83, "end": 94, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RICH", "start": 293, "end": 296, "matched_text": "RICH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ACNE", "start": 307, "end": 310, "matched_text": "ACNE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ACNE", "start": 307, "end": 310, "matched_text": "ACNE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PRUNUS", "start": 345, "end": 350, "matched_text": "PRUNUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 823, "end": 825, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 836, "end": 839, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 836, "end": 839, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 842, "end": 846, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HSP90AA1", "start": 849, "end": 856, "matched_text": "HSP90AA1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SRC", "start": 859, "end": 861, "matched_text": "SRC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HIF1A", "start": 864, "end": 868, "matched_text": "HIF1A", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CXCR4", "start": 871, "end": 875, "matched_text": "CXCR4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CXCR4", "start": 871, "end": 875, "matched_text": "CXCR4", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IGF1R", "start": 881, "end": 885, "matched_text": "IGF1R", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORE PROTEIN", "start": 908, "end": 919, "matched_text": "CORE PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 921, "end": 927, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 921, "end": 927, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PPI", "start": 942, "end": 944, "matched_text": "PPI", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "POSITIVE REGULATION OF CELL MIGRATION", "start": 1237, "end": 1273, "matched_text": "POSITIVE REGULATION OF CELL MIGRATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "POSITIVE REGULATION OF PHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 1276, "end": 1313, "matched_text": "POSITIVE REGULATION OF PHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA", "start": 1339, "end": 1357, "matched_text": "RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HIF-1", "start": 1410, "end": 1414, "matched_text": "HIF-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1416, "end": 1432, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CALCIUM SIGNALING", "start": 1435, "end": 1451, "matched_text": "CALCIUM SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MACROPHAGE", "start": 1462, "end": 1471, "matched_text": "MACROPHAGE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MSP", "start": 1493, "end": 1495, "matched_text": "MSP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1497, "end": 1505, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 1515, "end": 1517, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 1515, "end": 1517, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TLR4", "start": 1642, "end": 1645, "matched_text": "TLR4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CXCL12", "start": 1662, "end": 1667, "matched_text": "CXCL12", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 1815, "end": 1825, "matched_text": "HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1837, "end": 1840, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1837, "end": 1840, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 1842, "end": 1850, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and aggressive malignancy that frequently metastasizes to the liver, presenting significant therapeutic challenges. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying CRC liver metastasis and resistance to immune therapy remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving CRC metastasis using a novel approach, which includes the establishment of highly metastatic CRC cell lines. To explore the role of specific genes in CRC liver metastasis, we developed two highly metastatic CRC cell lines (LoVo-Hm and HCT116-Hm) by applying sustained selective pressure to primary CRC cells. RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in these metastatic cells. Additionally, we conducted assays for cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and ELISA to evaluate VEGFA production, all to confirm the functional role of SLC9A2. Our findings were further validated in human CRC tissue samples and publicly available datasets to assess the clinical relevance of the identified targets. Our analysis revealed a significant downregulation of SLC9A2 in the highly metastatic CRC cell lines. Mechanistically, we found that SLC9A2 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, SLC9A2 reduces VEGFA secretion, normalizing tumor vasculature and reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME), which ultimately enhances anti-tumor immunity. Comparative analysis of CRC tissue samples showed reduced SLC9A2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, with a negative correlation to TNM staging. Importantly, higher SLC9A2 expression was associated with better treatment responses in immunotherapy cohorts. These findings highlight the critical role of SLC9A2 in regulating metastasis, angiogenesis, and TME remodeling in CRC. By modulating the STAT3 pathway and tumor vasculature, SLC9A2 emerges as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Targeting SLC9A2 may enhance immune responses and improve treatment outcomes in CRC, offering a promising avenue for future therapeutic strategies.", "entities": [{"entity": "COLORECTAL CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 17, "matched_text": "COLORECTAL CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CRC", "start": 20, "end": 22, "matched_text": "CRC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 99, "end": 103, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 461, "end": 464, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 461, "end": 464, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 488, "end": 491, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 673, "end": 675, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 673, "end": 675, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL MIGRATION", "start": 810, "end": 823, "matched_text": "CELL MIGRATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ANGIOGENESIS", "start": 836, "end": 847, "matched_text": "ANGIOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 872, "end": 876, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SLC9A2", "start": 928, "end": 933, "matched_text": "SLC9A2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 985, "end": 990, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CLINICAL RELEVANCE", "start": 1046, "end": 1063, "matched_text": "CLINICAL RELEVANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION", "start": 1241, "end": 1273, "matched_text": "EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EMT", "start": 1276, "end": 1278, "matched_text": "EMT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "STAT3", "start": 1315, "end": 1319, "matched_text": "STAT3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1321, "end": 1337, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SECRETION", "start": 1371, "end": 1379, "matched_text": "SECRETION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 1394, "end": 1398, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VASCULATURE", "start": 1400, "end": 1410, "matched_text": "VASCULATURE", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Many researchers have previously reported that natural compounds from plants or Chinese Traditional Herbs have a potential to treat NSCLC. But it has not been reported that phytol can treat NSCLC. In this research, we first exposed this effect on A549 cells and researched the mechanism. In order to evaluate whether phytol has a role in human NSCLC, a human non-tumoral bronchial epithelial cell line (NL20), adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cell line, and NCI-H69 SCLC (H69) cell line were used for related experiments. After determining that phytol had no toxicity to NL20 cells, A549 cells, or H69 cells, the inhibitory effect of phytol on cancer cell related characteristics of cells were determined by luciferase assay, QRT-PCR, proliferation, invasion, and would healing cellular response experiments. Additionally, the quantification of apoptotic cells has been achieved through flow cytometry. Then, bioinformatics was used to establish a database to screen and speculate on phytol's corresponding targets in lung cancer. Finally, immunoblotting experiments were used to determine the specific pathways affected by phytol. Treatment with phytol at concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 ÂµM for 24 hours was not cytotoxic to the A549 cells and H69 cells. Phytol inhibited AP-1-mediated and NF-ÎºB-mediated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells, but not H69 cells. Additionally, phytol significantly inhibited the levels of MMP9, IL-6, VEGFA, IL-8, and NFKBIA in A549 cells, but had no significant effects on H69 cells. Phytol induced significant dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects on A549 cells. A significant decrease in colony formation and migration was observed. Bioinformatic and immunoblotting analysis indicated that phytol inhibited proliferation and migration of A549 cells through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Phytol exhibits anticancer activity by inhibiting PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and may be applicable in the clinical prevention and treatment of lung cancer in the future.", "entities": [{"entity": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 26, "matched_text": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 26, "matched_text": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 63, "end": 73, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 63, "end": 73, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 406, "end": 409, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIAL CELL", "start": 457, "end": 471, "matched_text": "EPITHELIAL CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 541, "end": 544, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 541, "end": 544, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 742, "end": 747, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 742, "end": 747, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AFFECTED", "start": 1210, "end": 1217, "matched_text": "AFFECTED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUCIFERASE ACTIVITY", "start": 1410, "end": 1428, "matched_text": "LUCIFERASE ACTIVITY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MMP9", "start": 1550, "end": 1553, "matched_text": "MMP9", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-6", "start": 1556, "end": 1559, "matched_text": "IL-6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-6", "start": 1556, "end": 1559, "matched_text": "IL-6", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 1562, "end": 1566, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-8", "start": 1569, "end": 1572, "matched_text": "IL-8", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IL-8", "start": 1569, "end": 1572, "matched_text": "IL-8", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NFKBIA", "start": 1579, "end": 1584, "matched_text": "NFKBIA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 1762, "end": 1770, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 1928, "end": 1931, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT SIGNALING", "start": 1933, "end": 1945, "matched_text": "AKT SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1937, "end": 1953, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired secretion, necessitating the identification of new markers to target its development and complications. This study conducted a genome-wide study on diabetes mellitus (type 2)-associated genes in Homo sapiens to better understand their role and explore their potential mechanisms. Twenty genes linked to type 2 diabetes were found in this study, and the various analyses, including chromosome localization, synteny analysis, physiochemical features, phylogenetic analysis, motif analysis, protein-protein interactions, gene structure, and expression profiles, were examined using a variety of bioinformatics tools. The findings revealed that the FOS gene was highly acidic with an isoelectric point (pI = 4.77); however, the VEGFA gene was greatly basic with an isoelectric point (pI = 9.24) as compared to the chosen genes in H. sapiens. A chromosomal localization analysis showed that diabetes-associated genes were randomly positioned on human chromosomes, with four genes (ELMO1, GCK, GNAI, and CYP3A4) on Chr7, while seven individual genes included PPM1K, TDO2, GALNT7, PIK3R1, VEGFA, PTGS1, TCF7L2, GNG3, SIRT4, and SSTR2 on chromosome numbers 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 17, respectively. There were no tandem duplication events detected. Thirteen taxa (consisting of 26 genes) were identified by a phylogenetic tree, and seven taxa revealed orthologous conservation. Motif analysis showed the top 5 motifs were expected with identical frequency except motif 1 and motif 2. Strong interactions were seen between the ELMO1 gene and all predictive partners bearing a higher bitscore value of 1439.5 than other genes indicated by protein-protein interaction. Regarding gene structure analysis, the CHL1 gene showed a maximum number of 26 exons as compared with other genes in its structure. The highest expression level was exhibited by the CYP3A4 gene in the liver and pancreas as compared with other genes.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of PI3K, Akt, phosphorylated Akt(p-Akt), HIF-1Î±, vascular endothelial growth factor A(VEGFA), transforming growth factor-Î²1(TGF-Î²1), epithelial cadherin(E-cadherin), neural cadherin(N-cadherin), vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase 2(MMP2), matrix metalloproteinase 9(MMP9), B-cell lymphoma-2(Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein(Bax), and caspase-3 in the hypoxic core region of the tumor tissue. A cell hypoxia model was established, and the effects of AC-medicated serum(model group, AC 1â¶1, 2â¶1, and 4â¶1 groups) on angiogenesis, proliferation, adhesion, invasion, and migration of 143B osteosarcoma cells were examined through CCK-8, flow cytometry, Transwell assay, cell adhesion assay, and HUVEC tube formation assay. The results showed that compared with the model group, the tumor weight and volume were smallest in the 2â¶1 group. The expression levels of PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, HIF-1Î±, VEGFA, and TGF-Î²1 were significantly decreased, and the protein expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased, while the protein expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, MMP2, and MMP9 was significantly decreased. Additionally, the protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 was significantly increased, and Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly decreased. In vitro experiments showed that after intervention with AC-medicated serum at a 2â¶1 ratio, the cell activity, adhesion, invasion, and migration of 143B cells were significantly reduced, apoptosis was significantly increased, and HUVEC tube formation was significantly decreased. In conclusion, the 2â¶1 ratio of AC showed the most effective inhibition of 143B cell growth. AC can inhibit the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma 143B cells by regulating the PI3K/Akt/HIF-1Î± signaling pathway, inhibiting angiogenesis and reducing cell adhesion, invasion, and migration.", "entities": [{"entity": "AIMS", "start": 12, "end": 15, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "start": 131, "end": 142, "matched_text": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "start": 131, "end": 142, "matched_text": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ANGIOGENESIS", "start": 248, "end": 259, "matched_text": "ANGIOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL ADHESION", "start": 265, "end": 277, "matched_text": "CELL ADHESION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 325, "end": 328, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "start": 331, "end": 346, "matched_text": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 348, "end": 350, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPOXIA", "start": 353, "end": 359, "matched_text": "HYPOXIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HIF-1", "start": 382, "end": 386, "matched_text": "HIF-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 420, "end": 424, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NUDE", "start": 434, "end": 437, "matched_text": "NUDE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 695, "end": 698, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 733, "end": 739, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 733, "end": 739, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR A", "start": 809, "end": 844, "matched_text": "VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR A", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 846, "end": 850, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIAL CADHERIN", "start": 895, "end": 913, "matched_text": "EPITHELIAL CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "E-CADHERIN", "start": 915, "end": 924, "matched_text": "E-CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NEURAL CADHERIN", "start": 928, "end": 942, "matched_text": "NEURAL CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 957, "end": 964, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 957, "end": 964, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MMP2", "start": 994, "end": 997, "matched_text": "MMP2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MMP9", "start": 1028, "end": 1031, "matched_text": "MMP9", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "B-CELL LYMPHOMA", "start": 1035, "end": 1049, "matched_text": "B-CELL LYMPHOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "B-CELL LYMPHOMA", "start": 1035, "end": 1049, "matched_text": "B-CELL LYMPHOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BCL-2", "start": 1053, "end": 1057, "matched_text": "BCL-2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BCL-2", "start": 1053, "end": 1057, "matched_text": "BCL-2", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BAX", "start": 1088, "end": 1090, "matched_text": "BAX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CASPASE-3", "start": 1098, "end": 1106, "matched_text": "CASPASE-3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORE", "start": 1123, "end": 1126, "matched_text": "CORE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 1148, "end": 1153, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1158, "end": 1161, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1158, "end": 1161, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CCK", "start": 1395, "end": 1397, "matched_text": "CCK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUBE FORMATION", "start": 1466, "end": 1479, "matched_text": "TUBE FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 2208, "end": 2216, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL GROWTH", "start": 2383, "end": 2393, "matched_text": "CELL GROWTH", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 2499, "end": 2515, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}]}

While HAVD has been defined as a peripheral vascular injury disorders, its comprehensive disease mechanisms-spanning molecular drivers, pathophysiological cascades, and clinically actionable biomarkers remain substantially unelucidated. Our study has used miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in HAVD patients compared to workers exposed to hand-transmitted vibration. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have been utilized to explore the role of miR-100-5p in endothelial cell dysfunction. Our results reveal that 36 miRNAs were upregulated and 2 miRNAs were downregulated in HAVD patients. Notably, miR-100-5p and miR-4735-5p exhibited the most significant differential expression.The area under the curve (AUC) for miR-100-5p in distinguishing hand-transmitted vibration-exposed workers from healthy individuals was 0.9906, while its AUC for identifying HAVD was 0.9922. The combination of those two miRNAs as the diagnostic marker of HAVD showed great potential has higher AUC, with high sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, miR-100-5p might mediate the pathology of HAVD by inhibiting vascular cell angiogenesis via VEGFA/VEGFR pathway, which could be regulated by decreased TRIB2 expression and inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.", "entities": [{"entity": "HAND", "start": 1, "end": 4, "matched_text": "HAND", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HAND", "start": 1, "end": 4, "matched_text": "HAND", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ARM", "start": 6, "end": 8, "matched_text": "ARM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 20, "end": 26, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RAYNAUD'S DISEASE", "start": 63, "end": 79, "matched_text": "RAYNAUD'S DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 226, "end": 231, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PERIPHERAL", "start": 267, "end": 276, "matched_text": "PERIPHERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VEIN", "start": 674, "end": 677, "matched_text": "VEIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 740, "end": 743, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MIR", "start": 748, "end": 750, "matched_text": "MIR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ENDOTHELIAL CELL", "start": 762, "end": 777, "matched_text": "ENDOTHELIAL CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1406, "end": 1409, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1406, "end": 1409, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ANGIOGENESIS", "start": 1411, "end": 1422, "matched_text": "ANGIOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 1428, "end": 1432, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRIB2", "start": 1487, "end": 1491, "matched_text": "TRIB2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "P38", "start": 1526, "end": 1528, "matched_text": "P38", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAPK SIGNALING", "start": 1530, "end": 1543, "matched_text": "MAPK SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1535, "end": 1551, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}]}

The expression levels of MIF-AS1 were detected by RT-qPCR. The LDH model was constructed in SD rats, and the paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) of LDH rats were detected by behavioral experiments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the concentrations of TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-1Î². The targeted regulatory relationships between MIF-AS1 and miR-185-5p, miR-185-5p and VEGFA were verified by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.ResultThe expression of MIF-AS1 was up-regulated in LDH patients and correlated with the degree of pain in patients.

{"text": "Aberrant angiogenesis is an important pathological feature of periodontitis, which is regulated by angiogenic paracrine factors derived from periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). We have previously demonstrated that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) was upregulated in PDLSCs from periodontitis patients, but its role in aberrant angiogenesis in periodontitis remains unclear. PDLSCs were isolated from healthy individuals and periodontitis patients. To mimic inflammatory conditions in vitro, PDLSCs from healthy individuals were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured with conditioned media from PDLSCs, and their proliferation, migration, and tube formation were detected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic capacity of PDLSCs. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) levels were measured using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, Immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. UCHL1 was knocked down using shRNA to validate its function and regulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to verify the interaction of UCHL1 with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1Î±), and chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the effect of HIF-1Î± on YAP transcription. UCHL1 inhibitor was administered in a periodontitis murine model to investigate its function in vivo. The pro-angiogenic capacity of PDLSCs from periodontitis patients was enhanced, accompanied by increased expressions of VEGFA and ANGPT1, which were positively correlated with UCHL1 expression. UCHL1 knockdown in PDLSCs abrogated the increased secretion of VEGFA and ANGPT1 and the enhanced pro-angiogenic capacity under inflammatory conditions. Mechanistically, UCHL1 functioned through facilitating YAP expression and nuclear translocation, a process that was mediated by the stabilization and activation of HIF-1Î±, which in turn promoted YAP transcription. In vivo inhibition of UCHL1 in a periodontitis murine model alleviated aberrant angiogenesis and reduced the expressions of VEGFA and ANGPT1, thus attenuating periodontitis progression by reducing lymphocyte infiltration, inflammatory cytokine levels, and alveolar bone resorption. This study demonstrated that UCHL1 promoted the pro-angiogenic capacity of PDLSCs in periodontitis through the HIF-1Î±/YAP signaling, which provides insights into the pathogenesis of periodontitis and paves the way for novel treatment strategies.", "entities": [{"entity": "ANGIOGENESIS", "start": 10, "end": 21, "matched_text": "ANGIOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PERIODONTITIS", "start": 63, "end": 75, "matched_text": "PERIODONTITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PERIODONTITIS", "start": 63, "end": 75, "matched_text": "PERIODONTITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LIGAMENT", "start": 154, "end": 161, "matched_text": "LIGAMENT", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN C-TERMINAL HYDROLASE", "start": 221, "end": 250, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN C-TERMINAL HYDROLASE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "UCHL1", "start": 256, "end": 260, "matched_text": "UCHL1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 326, "end": 329, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "start": 557, "end": 577, "matched_text": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "start": 557, "end": 577, "matched_text": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ALPHA", "start": 579, "end": 583, "matched_text": "ALPHA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VEIN", "start": 624, "end": 627, "matched_text": "VEIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TUBE FORMATION", "start": 737, "end": 750, "matched_text": "TUBE FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR A", "start": 817, "end": 852, "matched_text": "VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR A", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 855, "end": 859, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ANGPT1", "start": 882, "end": 887, "matched_text": "ANGPT1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 1067, "end": 1076, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "YES", "start": 1081, "end": 1083, "matched_text": "YES", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1096, "end": 1102, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1096, "end": 1102, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "YAP", "start": 1105, "end": 1107, "matched_text": "YAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPOXIA", "start": 1192, "end": 1198, "matched_text": "HYPOXIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HIF-1", "start": 1226, "end": 1230, "matched_text": "HIF-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 1240, "end": 1248, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1319, "end": 1331, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SECRETION", "start": 1680, "end": 1688, "matched_text": "SECRETION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION", "start": 1856, "end": 1876, "matched_text": "NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROCESS", "start": 1881, "end": 1887, "matched_text": "PROCESS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LYMPHOCYTE", "start": 2194, "end": 2203, "matched_text": "LYMPHOCYTE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BONE RESORPTION", "start": 2262, "end": 2276, "matched_text": "BONE RESORPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 2402, "end": 2410, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 2446, "end": 2457, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}]}

We analyzed 345 samples from 124 participants. At baseline, we observed community-level differences in the fecal microbiota among participants with abnormal compared to normal calprotectin. With ETI, the relative abundances of 7 bacterial species - Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium scindens, Enterocloster clostridioformis, Clostridium butyricum, Anaeroglobus geminatus, and Ruminococcus gnavus - decreased significantly, correlating with calprotectin decrease. We detected community-level differences in the fecal microbiota based on CFTR genotype and a distinct pattern of microbiota change in F508del homozygous compared to heterozygous participants after ETI. We identified 7 species for which fecal abundances decreased with ETI and correlated with calprotectin decrease, supporting a close relationship between fecal microbiota and inflammation in PwCF.

In contrast to prior reports claiming a lack of ionocytes in the small airways, we demonstrate that ionocytes are present in small and large airways in similar proportions.

However, Type 2 and Type 17 cytokines divert TIP cell lineage in vitro, resulting in the production of mature tuft cells at the expense of ionocyte differentiation.

Fifteen had persistently (during >6 months) elevated liver enzymes (mostly ALT); 17 had abnormal ultrasound including 3 with nodular liver and 3 with pathological elastography; 5 had isolated splenomegaly. Biliary involvement was found in 19 patients. The evolution of hepatic parameters in the overall population was not significant (p > 0.05). However, we observed a trend towards improvement in laboratory values under treatment. There was only one inaugural diagnosis of nodular liver under LI and none under ETI. All patients had preserved liver function (PT>50 %). We did not find a significant improvement or worsening of hepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulators. We hypothesize that it could be stabilized with these treatments, but this will need confirmation through further studies with longer follow-up and larger cohorts.

{"text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease caused by dysfunctional or absent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is expressed in immune cells and regulates innate immunity, both directly and indirectly. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) contributes to dysfunction in CF airway epithelial cells. However, the impact of non-CFTR ion channel dysfunction on CF immune responses is not understood. Improved understanding of how immune function is regulated by ion channels may allow antibiotic- and mutation-agnostic treatment approaches to chronic infection and inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that ENaC is aberrantly expressed in CF macrophages and directly contributes to impaired phagocytic and inflammatory functions. ENaC expression was characterized in immune cells isolated from CF and non-CF blood donors. Monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) function and bacterial killing was tested with ENaC modulation. Baseline ENaC expression in human CF MDMs, lymphocytes, and granulocytes was increased at both the transcript and protein level relative to non-CF and persisted after infection. CFTR inhibition in non-CF MDMs resulted in ENaC overexpression. CFTR modulator treatment reduced but did not eliminate ENaC overexpression in CF MDMs. Interestingly, ENaC inhibition increased CFTR expression.

Sodium channel expression in CF MDMs normalized after Amiloride treatment with minimal effect on other ion channels.

{"text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems. It is caused by a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which results in the absence or damage of a relevant protein. If left untreated, it causes death in early childhood. The advent of more efficacious treatments has resulted in a notable increase in the life expectancy of CF patients. This has, in turn, led to an elevated risk of developing specific types of cancer. This review commences with an examination of CF from the standpoint of its etiology and therapeutic modalities. Subsequently, it presents a list of epidemiological studies that suggest an altered predisposition to certain cancers. A heightened risk is well documented, particularly in relation to the gastrointestinal tract. The following section addresses the role of CFTR in view of its potential involvement in the progression of various types of cancer. Several studies have indicated that the levels of the CFTR protein are reduced in many tumors and that this reduction is associated with the progression of the tumors. These decreased expressions are known to occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, bladder, and/or prostate cancer. Conversely, ovarian, stomach, and cervical cancer are connected with its higher expression. The final section of the review focuses on the molecular mechanism of action of the CFTR protein in signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and the process of carcinogenesis. This section attempts to explain the increased predisposition to cancer observed in patients with CF.", "entities": [{"entity": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS", "start": 1, "end": 15, "matched_text": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENETIC DISEASE", "start": 41, "end": 55, "matched_text": "GENETIC DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ORGAN", "start": 79, "end": 83, "matched_text": "ORGAN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR", "start": 128, "end": 178, "matched_text": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR", "start": 128, "end": 178, "matched_text": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CFTR", "start": 181, "end": 184, "matched_text": "CFTR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 187, "end": 190, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 187, "end": 190, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 225, "end": 230, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 246, "end": 252, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 246, "end": 252, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DEATH IN EARLY CHILDHOOD", "start": 284, "end": 307, "matched_text": "DEATH IN EARLY CHILDHOOD", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 501, "end": 506, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 501, "end": 506, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 870, "end": 873, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROSTATE CANCER", "start": 1236, "end": 1250, "matched_text": "PROSTATE CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROSTATE CANCER", "start": 1236, "end": 1250, "matched_text": "PROSTATE CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "STOMACH", "start": 1274, "end": 1280, "matched_text": "STOMACH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CERVICAL CANCER", "start": 1287, "end": 1301, "matched_text": "CERVICAL CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1445, "end": 1453, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "start": 1476, "end": 1493, "matched_text": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROCESS", "start": 1503, "end": 1509, "matched_text": "PROCESS", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "One of the typical benign gynecologic conditions in women of childbearing age is endometriosis, which can almost always lead to pelvic pain, infertility, and menstrual irregularities. The biochemical features of endometriosis focus on the folic acid and one-carbon cycle. Endometriosis cannot be diagnosed by a blood test. An important enzyme in the folate cycle is methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). There are a number of variants in the MTHFR gene, but the C677T polymorphism has received the most attention and is associated with a number of diseases and problems. To investigate the association between MTHFR (C677T) and MTR (A2756G) gene polymorphisms and the pathogenesis of endometriosis. A total of 51 endometriosis cases and 51 healthy volunteers were genotyped for MTHFR (C677T) and MTR (A2756G) gene polymorphisms. Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequency of genotypes was analyzed by the Chi-square test and odds ratio for relative risk. The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT genotypes of MTHFR C677T were 17.65%, 54.90%, and 27.45% in cases and 64.71%, 15.69%, and 19.61% in controls, respectively. In addition, the frequencies of the C and T alleles were 46.92% and 53.08% in cases and 72.55% and 27.45% in controls, respectively. The T-allele and the CT and TT genotypes of the MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism were significantly associated with cases. No significant association with cases was observed for the MTR A2756G gene polymorphism.

It highlights recent findings on diagnostic methods, pathophysiological mechanisms, and health implications associated with NWO. Individuals with NWO have an increased risk of developing chronic inflammation, cardiometabolic disorders, insulin resistance, and sarcopenia. Genetic factors, including polymorphisms in IL-6, IL-1Ra, IL-15Ra, and MTHFR genes, play a significant role in determining susceptibility. Lifestyle behaviors, reduced physical activity and frequent intake of ultra-processed foods, further elevate metabolic risks. Advanced diagnostic techniques, particularly Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), are essential for accurate identification of NWO, as traditional BMI measurements fail to adequately detect this phenotype.

These were evaluated in two independent childhood ALL GWASs, the California Childhood Cancer Record Linkage Project and California Childhood Leukemia Study, the latter with available self-reported periconceptional nutrition data.

{"text": "This study aims to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms in key enzyme genes involved in folate metabolism and recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). Genotypic data and red blood cell folate levels were collected from 150 patients with RSA and 120 healthy controls. The genotype and allele frequency distribution at the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, A1298C, and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G loci were analyzed and compared. Additionally, homocysteine levels were measured. Significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies were observed between the RSA group and the control group at the MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G loci. Specifically, the distribution of genotypes and alleles at the MTHFR C677T locus showed a marked divergence between the two groups. In the RSA group, the frequency of the TT genotype was notably higher compared to the control group, suggesting a potential association with an increased risk of recurrent spontaneous abortion. Similarly, at the MTRR A66G locus, the AG and GG genotypes were more prevalent in the RSA group than in the control group, further implicating these genetic variants in the pathogenesis of RSA. We identified a significant association between the TT genotype of MTHFR C677T and reduced red blood cell folate concentration. Additionally, the AG and GG genotypes of MTRR A66G were found to be linked to an increased risk of RSA.

{"text": "Bai-Shao (BS) ingredients capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were identified and analyzed for their main gene targets. Genes associated with epileptic seizures (ES), cognitive impairment (CI), and inflammation were retrieved, with common targets between BS and these conditions determined via Venn analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis identified the top 10 key genes, whose correlations with apolipoprotein E (APOE) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were assessed. Functional pathways were explored using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), while molecular docking evaluated interactions between BS compounds and target proteins. Findings were validated in a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced mouse model. BS contains Î²-sitosterol and betulinic acid, both BBB-permeable, with 277 shared ES/CI-related targets identified. The top 10 genes correlated with APOE and MTHFR, and pathway analysis highlighted interleukin-17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, involving FOS proto-oncogene (FOS), jun proto-oncogene (JUN), caspase-3 (CASP3), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). Behavioral tests, including the Open Field Test and Morris Water Maze, indicated cognitive and motor improvements in PTZ-treated mice. Molecular analysis revealed hippocampal regulation of key genes and altered TNF-alpha (TNFÎ±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) levels. In conclusion, BS demonstrates therapeutic potential for comorbid ES and CI by modulating inflammatory pathways and cell survival mechanisms, supporting its role in neurological research.

{"text": "Alport syndrome is a hereditary disorder characterized by hematuria, proteinuria and progressive renal failure, frequently associated with extrarenal manifestations. The pathogenic variants of the COL4A5 gene are associated with X-linked Alport syndrome while those of the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes are associated with the autosomal recessive (AR) or dominant (AD) form. The disease is characterized by considerable phenotypic variability linked to the different genes involved and the different mutations present, so the symptoms manifest themselves in different frequencies depending on the case. The existence of an autosomal dominant form of Alport syndrome has been identified in recent years thanks to next generation gene sequencing (NGS) techniques which have made it possible to highlight unknown genetic variants of Alport syndrome. The family studied by us presents concomitant heterozygous alterations of the COL4A3 genes (c.1029+5G>A with MAF 0 and c.3211-7A>G with MAF 1:100000), heterozygous alterations of the MTHFR gene (both C677T and A1298C) and homozygous alteration of the PAI-1 gene. While the variant c.3211-7A>G, as shown by genetic databases (ClinVar), appears to be benign, the intronic variant c.1029+5G>A (caused by exon skipping) can be classified as pathogenic due to its characteristics and the fact that it co-segregates with the phenotype within the family.

{"text": "Understanding liver diseases is important worldwide due to their prevalence. Apart from liver disease arising from hepatitis C viral infection, most chronic liver diseases currently have no cure. Several therapeutic alternatives, including some natural products, have been proposed to treat liver diseases. The natural product Jatropha dioica has been reported to possess antioxidant activity and, by extension, could have hepatoprotective activity. Accordingly, our aim was to test the hypothesis that an extract of J. dioica is protective against liver damage induced by valproic acid (VPA). Twelve male and twelve female Wistar rats were sorted into four groups: control, non-toxicity, valproic acid control (VPA-C), and J. dioica + VPA (JdVPA). J. dioica (300 mg/kg, given orally) was used as treatment, followed by a concomitant injection of VPA (500 mg/kg, i.p.) for the first 4 days to induce liver injury. To evaluate the severity of the injury, liver function tests were performed. In addition, oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified, as well as measures of the expression of the genes Actb, Il6, and Nfkb1. The VPA-C group showed a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malondialdehyde (MDA), a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a reduction in glutathione (GSH) vs the control group. The JdVPA group showed a significant decrease in ALT, AST, and MDA and an increase in GSH and SOD vs the VPA-C group. Gene expression of Il6 and Nfkb1 did not show any statistically significant differences between study groups. Histologically, VPA presented an inflammatory infiltrate, which decreased in the JdVPA group. The extract of J. dioica at the administered dose did not display toxicity and was capable of ameliorating the liver injury generated by VPA in biochemical and oxidative stress biomarkers, which suggests its potential hepatoprotective activity.", "entities": [{"entity": "LIVER", "start": 15, "end": 19, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIVER DISEASE", "start": 89, "end": 101, "matched_text": "LIVER DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIVER DISEASE", "start": 89, "end": 101, "matched_text": "LIVER DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEPATITIS C", "start": 116, "end": 126, "matched_text": "HEPATITIS C", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VIRAL INFECTION", "start": 128, "end": 142, "matched_text": "VIRAL INFECTION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VIRAL INFECTION", "start": 128, "end": 142, "matched_text": "VIRAL INFECTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 150, "end": 156, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY", "start": 373, "end": 392, "matched_text": "ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 556, "end": 561, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SEVERITY", "start": 931, "end": 938, "matched_text": "SEVERITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1005, "end": 1020, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ACTB", "start": 1101, "end": 1104, "matched_text": "ACTB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL6", "start": 1107, "end": 1109, "matched_text": "IL6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NFKB1", "start": 1116, "end": 1120, "matched_text": "NFKB1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE", "start": 1172, "end": 1195, "matched_text": "ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALT", "start": 1198, "end": 1200, "matched_text": "ALT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALT", "start": 1198, "end": 1200, "matched_text": "ALT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE", "start": 1204, "end": 1229, "matched_text": "ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AST", "start": 1232, "end": 1234, "matched_text": "AST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MDA", "start": 1259, "end": 1261, "matched_text": "MDA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SOD", "start": 1301, "end": 1303, "matched_text": "SOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SOD", "start": 1301, "end": 1303, "matched_text": "SOD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SOD", "start": 1301, "end": 1303, "matched_text": "SOD", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 1484, "end": 1498, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 1517, "end": 1519, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Neuroprotective properties of silicon have been reported, particularly in mitigating dementia and Alzheimer's disease due to its ability to reduce aluminum bioavailability. However, its potential as a nutritional adjuvant in reducing brain damage associated with hypercholesterolemia and central insulin resistance (IR) in late-stage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of silicon-enriched meat (Si-RM) on the brain cortex of T2DM rats. Rat models of early-stage-T2DM (ED) (n = 8) and late-stage-T2DM (LD) (n = 16) were induced by high-saturated fat diet and high-saturated fat high-cholesterol diet plus streptozotocin/nicotinamide injection, respectively. A control meat (C-RM) was included in the diet of both ED and LD groups. Finally, after confirming hyperglycemia in LD rats, the C-RM was replaced by Si-RM in half of the animals for the last five weeks of the study, obtaining the LD-Si group (n = 8), while the other half continued eating C-RM. In LD rats pathological outcomes included: harmful oxysterol profile, decreased antioxidant defenses, neuroinflammation, brain IR, augmented glucose uptake and impaired cholinergic transmission. Si-RM consumption ameliorates these key outcomes by reducing brain levels of pro-oxidant oxysterols (25-OHC and 27-OHC) to levels of ED rats. Antioxidant defenses, including SOD and arylesterase activity, were enhanced, and inflammatory markers, such as GFAP, IL6, and TNFÎ±, were reduced compared to LD and ED counterparts. Notably, silicon restored brain insulin signaling, normalized glucose uptake via GLUT3, and shifted to an acetylcholine-preserving profile, significantly mitigating neurodegenerative risks.

{"text": "The conditions within the uterus where a mammalian fetus develops are crucial in shaping its physiological functions later in life. Changes in the availability of nutrients, oxygen, and hormones in the maternal blood stream can influence tissue development. We hypothesized that late gestation heat stress leads to alterations in gene expression in the cotyledonary tissue related to acute inflammation and impact the mechanisms of placental nutrient uptake, affecting the trajectory of fetal growth. Multiparous pregnant Holstein cows had lactation terminated (i.e. dried-off) at 232 Â± 5 days of gestation and were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: cooling (CL; access to the shade of a barn plus forced ventilation via fans and water soakers over the feed lane to provide active evaporative cooling) or heat-stress (HT; access to the shade of a barn and natural ventilation, no active cooling) for the entire duration of their dry period. Maternal plasma (n = 28/trt) cortisol concentrations were measured at days -14, -7 prior to and at parturition. At delivery, placental cotyledonary tissue samples were collected and analyzed for gene expression (n = 4-5/trt). During the final weeks of gestation, treatment impacted plasma cortisol concentrations as calving approached (p = 0.04), wherein HT dams exhibited lower plasma cortisol concentrations than CL dams at -14 days (9.65 vs. 13.09 Â± 1.5 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and at parturition (16.97 vs. 22.32 Â± 1.4 ng/ml; p < 0.001), combined with significant changes in placental gene pathways associated with acute inflammation and cortisol synthesis and secretion. Specifically, pathways related to interleukin-6 (IL6) and NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), which regulate inflammation, were upregulated by HT, suggesting placental inflammation. Additionally, pathways involved in nutrient transfer and amino acid metabolism were impaired, as HT downregulated key genes responsible for these functions, especially serine biosynthesis. These findings indicate that HT during late gestation leads to dysregulation of cortisol secretion pattern in maternal plasma, resulting in reduced cortisol levels in the HT animals. Additionally, it also caused placental inflammation impacting feto-maternal transfers, highlighting the importance of late gestation period on fetal development and managing maternal environmental stressors in dairy production.", "entities": [{"entity": "UTERUS", "start": 27, "end": 32, "matched_text": "UTERUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 212, "end": 216, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TISSUE DEVELOPMENT", "start": 239, "end": 256, "matched_text": "TISSUE DEVELOPMENT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LATE", "start": 280, "end": 283, "matched_text": "LATE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GESTATION", "start": 285, "end": 293, "matched_text": "GESTATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 331, "end": 345, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 367, "end": 372, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 391, "end": 402, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 391, "end": 402, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NUTRIENT UPTAKE", "start": 443, "end": 457, "matched_text": "NUTRIENT UPTAKE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LACTATION", "start": 541, "end": 549, "matched_text": "LACTATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DRY", "start": 941, "end": 943, "matched_text": "DRY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PLASMA", "start": 962, "end": 967, "matched_text": "PLASMA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRT", "start": 977, "end": 979, "matched_text": "TRT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PARTURITION", "start": 1052, "end": 1062, "matched_text": "PARTURITION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMS", "start": 1311, "end": 1314, "matched_text": "DAMS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1538, "end": 1541, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1538, "end": 1541, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORTISOL SYNTHESIS", "start": 1591, "end": 1608, "matched_text": "CORTISOL SYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SECRETION", "start": 1614, "end": 1622, "matched_text": "SECRETION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INTERLEUKIN-6", "start": 1659, "end": 1671, "matched_text": "INTERLEUKIN-6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL6", "start": 1674, "end": 1676, "matched_text": "IL6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PYRIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3", "start": 1694, "end": 1726, "matched_text": "PYRIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NLRP3", "start": 1729, "end": 1733, "matched_text": "NLRP3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NUTRIENT", "start": 1860, "end": 1867, "matched_text": "NUTRIENT", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AMINO ACID", "start": 1882, "end": 1891, "matched_text": "AMINO ACID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 1893, "end": 1902, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 1939, "end": 1941, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BIOSYNTHESIS", "start": 2000, "end": 2011, "matched_text": "BIOSYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CORTISOL SECRETION", "start": 2094, "end": 2111, "matched_text": "CORTISOL SECRETION", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain less understood. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a complex immune response contributing to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. This response is signaled in part by interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory cytokine. Phenotypic variance in circulating IL-6 level may be explained in part by DNA methylation which is increasingly being associated with cardiovascular effects. In this study we evaluated methylated DNA (CpG sites) associated with blood IL-6 levels across â¼4,400 ancestrally diverse individuals (81 % self-reported White; 9 % Black or African American, 8 % Hispanic or Latino/a, and 2 % Chinese American). We identified 178 CpG sites associated with IL-6 (p<0.05/â¼395,000). Among the sites, cg04437762 is located within the transcription unit of IL6R, a current therapeutic target for inflammatory disease, and cg26692003 and cg00464927 were significant for IL6 and IL6ST trans-CpG-gene transcripts. Functional gene expression downstream of methylation identified cellular response to IL-6 and B-cell regulation and activation pathways. Four genes were linked with both a genetic component of cardiovascular disease and an IL-6 associated CpG site. Three CpG sites identified through Mendelian randomization analyses supported inference of a causal effect on IL-6 levels, including the LYN gene that regulates immune cell signaling and has been previously associated with atherosclerosis. Overall, we identified several novel IL-6-CpG sites and downstream pathways affected by methylation. Follow-up functional studies including the regulation of IL-6 would complement current knowledge of CVD pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets.", "entities": [{"entity": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 22, "matched_text": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 161, "end": 167, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 179, "end": 190, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 179, "end": 190, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IMMUNE RESPONSE", "start": 205, "end": 219, "matched_text": "IMMUNE RESPONSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INTERLEUKIN-6", "start": 321, "end": 333, "matched_text": "INTERLEUKIN-6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-6", "start": 336, "end": 339, "matched_text": "IL-6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-6", "start": 336, "end": 339, "matched_text": "IL-6", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DNA METHYLATION", "start": 459, "end": 473, "matched_text": "DNA METHYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 581, "end": 583, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 613, "end": 617, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 910, "end": 922, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IL6R", "start": 932, "end": 935, "matched_text": "IL6R", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 984, "end": 990, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "IL6", "start": 1044, "end": 1046, "matched_text": "IL6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL6ST", "start": 1052, "end": 1056, "matched_text": "IL6ST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1068, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1068, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 1097, "end": 1111, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "METHYLATION", "start": 1127, "end": 1137, "matched_text": "METHYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELLULAR RESPONSE TO IL-6", "start": 1150, "end": 1174, "matched_text": "CELLULAR RESPONSE TO IL-6", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1182, "end": 1185, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1182, "end": 1185, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 1187, "end": 1196, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LYN", "start": 1472, "end": 1474, "matched_text": "LYN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1508, "end": 1516, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "start": 1558, "end": 1572, "matched_text": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "start": 1558, "end": 1572, "matched_text": "ATHEROSCLEROSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AFFECTED", "start": 1651, "end": 1658, "matched_text": "AFFECTED", "type": "symptom"}]}
{"text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited therapeutic options and poor long-term survival. Hypericum japonicum Thunb. (Tianjihuang), a traditional Chinese medicine exhibits promising anticancer properties. This study aims to elucidate the multi-target mechanisms of Tianjihuang in treating HCC using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. The active components of Tianjihuang and their targets were retrieved from TCMSP, PubChem, and Swiss Target Prediction databases. HCC-related targets were identified using GeneCard, OMIM, and TTD databases, and overlapping targets were analyzed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed and analyzed using Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis of key targets was performed via GO and KEGG pathways. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed the clinical relevance of core targets, and molecular docking evaluated the binding affinities between Tianjihuang components and key targets. Tianjihuang contained seven bioactive components targeting 207 genes, with 77 overlapping HCC-related targets. PPI analysis identified key targets, including AKT1, STAT3, EGFR, and ESR1, which play pivotal roles in HCC pathogenesis. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that Tianjihuang's anti-HCC effects involve multiple biological processes and pathways, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Molecular docking results showed high binding affinities of key components, such as quercetin and gallic acid, with core targets supporting their potential therapeutic effects. This study demonstrates that Tianjihuang exerts its anti-HCC effects through a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanism.

{"text": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Thuja occidentalis L., a medicinal plant native to Southern Punjab, Pakistan, is evaluated for its potential anticancer properties through a combination of computational and experimental approaches. A comprehensive screening identified 87 bioactive compounds, from which four isothujol, p-coumaric acid, cedrol, and kaempferol were selected for further analysis on the basis of their oral bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking studies indicated strong binding affinities between these compounds and key breast cancer-related targets, including PARP1, ESR1, MDM2, EGFR, and HIF1A. A Venn diagram and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed 16 common targets that are likely involved in the plant's anticancer effects. KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses identified 26 cancer-related pathways, including breast cancer, estrogen signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Molecular docking showed binding affinity ranges between -6.2 and -9.6 kcal/mol. The cytotoxic effects of two T. occidentalis extracts, ethyl acetate and n-hexane, were assessed using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, with significant inhibition at concentrations as low as 25 Âµg/mL, whereas the n-hexane extract showed limited activity. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed the presence of key bioactive compounds, such as thujone, cedrol, kaempferol, and quercetin, known for their anticancer properties.

{"text": "Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous chemical compound in plastics and resins, is a pervasive environmental pollutant posing significant health risks to humans and animals. Despite evidence linking BPA exposure to neuronal damage and cognitive impairments, its underlying mechanisms and core targets remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study employed an integrated metabolomics and network toxicology strategy to elucidate the neurotoxic mechanisms of BPA. Zebrafish embryos were subjected to BPA exposure (0.05, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L) from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Neurotoxic effects were assessed via developmental and morphological observations, behavioral analyses, metabolomics profiling, and transcriptional examinations. BPA exposure disrupted zebrafish larval development, suppressed central nervous system (CNS) neurogenesis, altered cardiac function, and induced significant neurobehavioral deficits. In addition, metabolomics analysis identified disruptions in glutamate metabolism as a key contributor to BPA-induced neurotoxicity. Utilizing databases such as comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD), ChEMBL, and GeneCards, we identified potential neurotoxicity-associated targets, further refined through STRING and Cytoscape analyses. Enrichment analysis using Metascape and molecular docking via Autodock revealed strong binding affinities between BPA and core targets, including PRKACA, ESR2, MMP9, PTGS2, DRD1, AR, and ESR1. Moreover, the BPA-ESR2 interaction and BPA-PRKACA interaction were further validated via SPR assay.

{"text": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive bone cancer with a poor prognosis, particularly in cases involving metastasis. While doxorubicin (ADM) is effective for OS treatment, its use is hindered by severe cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADM-induced cardiac injury and develop a novel strategy to reduce its toxicity, focusing on exosome-mediated drug delivery. Network toxicology and molecular docking techniques were used to identify the key molecular targets involved in ADM-induced cardiac injury. A target database was constructed from public databases (ChEMBL, STITCH, Swiss Target Prediction, GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD), and Venn diagram analysis was performed to identify the shared targets between ADM and cardiac injury-related genes. A regulatory network was constructed, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses to gain insights into the biological processes involved. Additionally, exosomes were isolated from human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and loaded with ADM via electroporation. The therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of exosome-encapsulated ADM (HOC-Exos@ADM) were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models. Network toxicology analysis identified 27 shared targets between ADM and cardiac injury, including key genes such as AKT1, TP53, ESR1, and HIF1A. These genes are involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, all of which contribute to cardiac damage. The exosome-mediated delivery improved drug uptake, increased apoptosis in OS cells. In AKT1 signaling, decreased AKT1 led to cardiomyocyte damage via GSK - 3Î² and mTOR pathways. Meanwhile, exhibited a safer profile in animal models. These results suggest that exosome-based delivery can reduce ADM-induced cardiotoxicity and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with OS.", "entities": [{"entity": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "start": 1, "end": 12, "matched_text": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "start": 1, "end": 12, "matched_text": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BONE CANCER", "start": 36, "end": 46, "matched_text": "BONE CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ADM", "start": 134, "end": 136, "matched_text": "ADM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXOSOME", "start": 376, "end": 382, "matched_text": "EXOSOME", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 393, "end": 396, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 486, "end": 488, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TTD", "start": 667, "end": 669, "matched_text": "TTD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 840, "end": 843, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 840, "end": 843, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXOS", "start": 1180, "end": 1183, "matched_text": "EXOS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT1", "start": 1357, "end": 1360, "matched_text": "AKT1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TP53", "start": 1363, "end": 1366, "matched_text": "TP53", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESR1", "start": 1369, "end": 1372, "matched_text": "ESR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HIF1A", "start": 1379, "end": 1383, "matched_text": "HIF1A", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1414, "end": 1422, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1425, "end": 1440, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1447, "end": 1458, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1447, "end": 1458, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1496, "end": 1501, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UPTAKE", "start": 1548, "end": 1553, "matched_text": "UPTAKE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1597, "end": 1605, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GSK", "start": 1655, "end": 1657, "matched_text": "GSK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GSK", "start": 1655, "end": 1657, "matched_text": "GSK", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MTOR", "start": 1669, "end": 1672, "matched_text": "MTOR", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Alcohol-induced gastric ulcers (GU) rank among the most prevalent upper gastrointestinal diseases, severely impacting patients' quality of life and health. Daidzein (DAI), one of the primary active compounds present in soybeans and other edible plants, has been reported to exert potential therapeutic effects on GU. This study sought to explore the potential mechanisms through which DAI alleviates alcohol-induced acute GU in rats. In this study, in vitro and in vivo models of alcohol-induced GU were established and employed a range of experimental techniques, including Immunofluorescence (IF), Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western Blotting (WB), and Real-time quantitative PCR (RT- qPCR), to assess the protective effects of DAI. Next, network pharmacology, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to identify the potential targets and mechanisms responsible for DAI's therapeutic action on GU. Finally, the activation of the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway was validated in both a rat model and a GES-1 cell model. DAI was shown to alleviate inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, while mitigating the reduction of Hâº/Kâº-ATPase and EGFR, thereby restoring the gastric barrier. In both in vitro and in vivo models, DAI showed stable binding to key residues of ESR1 (Leu387A, Arg394A, His524A, and Glu353A), and subsequently activated the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway. Notably, Fulvestrant (a selective ESR1 inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) both abrogated the activation of this pathway. DAI inhibited apoptosis and preserved mucosal integrity by targeting ESR1 to activate the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway.

{"text": "This study mainly explored the potential mechanism of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWD) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) based on network pharmacology, and to investigate whether HGWD promotes osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by upregulating ESR1 based on in vitro experiments. The core target genes and potential signaling pathways related to HGWD in OA treatment were analyzed using network pharmacology analysis. BMSCs were isolated from rats to induce for adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation, which were assessed by Oil Red O staining and Alizarin Red staining, respectively. ESR1 knockdown lentivirus was transfected into BMSCs and different concentrations of rat HGWD-containing serum was prepared to treat BMSCs. Cell proliferation activity was measured by CCK-8 assay to select the optimal concentration for further experiments. Cells were treated with 10% HGWD-containing serum and transfected with ESR1 knockdown lentivirus. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by ALP staining, ALP activity measurement, and Alizarin Red staining. The expression of osteogenic differentiation-related genes OCN, RUNX2, and COL1A1 was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that ESR1 is one of the core targets of HGWD in OA treatment. HGWD-containing serum promoted proliferation and osteogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs, and also increased ESR1 expression.

{"text": "Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the development of vitiligo. Although the specific mechanism of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (MitoQ) in vitiligo remains unclear, it has shown promise in the treatment of various diseases. In this study, we employed network pharmacology, molecular docking, transcriptomic approaches, and experimental verification to investigate the potential targets of MitoQ in vitiligo. Molecular docking results identified four possible crucial targets of MitoQ in vitiligo treatment: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3). MitoQ alleviated oxidative stress-induced PARP1 nuclear mislocalization, attenuated ROS accumulation, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhanced ATP synthesis in vitro analysis. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that MitoQ reduced the expression of DNA damage genes and genes involved in the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The protein-protein interaction network indicated a potential relationship between PARP1 and DNA damage-related genes, suggesting that MitoQ could interfere with abnormal PARP1 activation. Notably, MitoQ reduced cellular senescence by decreasing CDKN1A/p21 protein through PARP1, and the knockdown of PARP1 reduced oxidative damage. These results indicate that PARP1 decreases cellular senescence and offers a potential target for therapeutic research in the management of vitiligo.", "entities": [{"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1, "end": 16, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 38, "end": 41, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VITILIGO", "start": 65, "end": 72, "matched_text": "VITILIGO", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VITILIGO", "start": 65, "end": 72, "matched_text": "VITILIGO", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MITOCHONDRIA", "start": 114, "end": 125, "matched_text": "MITOCHONDRIA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "POLY", "start": 539, "end": 542, "matched_text": "POLY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PARP1", "start": 571, "end": 575, "matched_text": "PARP1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROSTAGLANDIN-ENDOPEROXIDE SYNTHASE 2", "start": 579, "end": 615, "matched_text": "PROSTAGLANDIN-ENDOPEROXIDE SYNTHASE 2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PTGS2", "start": 618, "end": 622, "matched_text": "PTGS2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "start": 626, "end": 642, "matched_text": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESR1", "start": 647, "end": 650, "matched_text": "ESR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR", "start": 670, "end": 687, "matched_text": "CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CXCR3", "start": 692, "end": 696, "matched_text": "CXCR3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROS", "start": 784, "end": 786, "matched_text": "ROS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE", "start": 811, "end": 832, "matched_text": "MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ATP SYNTHESIS", "start": 858, "end": 870, "matched_text": "ATP SYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 965, "end": 967, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 969, "end": 974, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 1008, "end": 1011, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 1013, "end": 1015, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAPK SIGNALING", "start": 1021, "end": 1034, "matched_text": "MAPK SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1050, "end": 1056, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1050, "end": 1056, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELLULAR SENESCENCE", "start": 1258, "end": 1276, "matched_text": "CELLULAR SENESCENCE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CDKN1A", "start": 1292, "end": 1297, "matched_text": "CDKN1A", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "P21", "start": 1299, "end": 1301, "matched_text": "P21", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Jiedu Huoxue decoction (JHD), a classical Chinese herbal prescription that originated from Wang Qingren's Correction on the Errors of Medical Works, has been shown to be effective in treating acute kidney injury (AKI), yet the mechanism remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to probe the efficacy of JHD on AKI and clarify its potential mechanism in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. An integrated tactic, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, pharmacodynamics, molecular biology, and metabolomics, was employed to illuminate the pharmacological mechanisms of JHD in treating AKI. Firstly, network pharmacology was adopted to predict potential drug targets and molecular pathways of AKI by utilizing the active ingredients in JHD. Secondly, molecular docking was used to explore the affinity between the active ingredients of JHD and AKI targets. Thirdly, biochemical analysis and histopathology were performed to estimate JHD's impact on cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid/immunofluorescence staining, and untargeted metabolomics were performed to understand the underlying mechanisms in vivo. In silico analysis identified 184 active compounds and 394 targets of JHD. Topology analysis based on the PPI network indicated 7 main targets. The GO and KEGG enriched signaling pathways pointed to metabolic changes due to JHD's effects on AKI. Molecular docking screening revealed that TP53, SRC, MAPK1, MAPK2, and AKT1 were the key targets of JHD. Further molecular biology and untargeted metabolomics experiments revealed that fatty acid uptake (CD36) and lipogenesis (sphingolipids, phospholipids, and neutral lipids) mediated by the p53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway may be involved in the protective effects of JHD against AKI in vivo.

{"text": "Genetic instability is a major hazard threatening the fate of cells and ultimately of organisms. DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a highly toxic lesion, jeopardizing genome stability. Using cytogenetic and differential exome sequencing, we show here that upregulation of the kinase PKB/AKT1 leads to genomic rearrangements and chromosome fusions. By combining various approaches, at the genome scale and at precise loci, we show that PKB/AKT1 stimulates DSB end-joining, leading to inter- and intrachromosomal genomic rearrangements. The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex plays an essential role in the early steps of DSB signaling/repair. We show here that PKB/AKT1 favors the assembly of MRN, leading to the stimulation of DSB signaling via the MRE11/ATM axis. We identify MRE11 as a phosphorylation effector of PKB/AKT1 and reveal several sites whose phosphorylation is required for PKB-mediated stimulation of DSB end-joining and chromosome fusions. These data reveal that PKB/AKT1 actively promotes genetic instability by increasing the efficiency of DSB end-joining through MRE11 phosphorylation on these sites.

(Tianjihuang), a traditional Chinese medicine exhibits promising anticancer properties. This study aims to elucidate the multi-target mechanisms of Tianjihuang in treating HCC using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. The active components of Tianjihuang and their targets were retrieved from TCMSP, PubChem, and Swiss Target Prediction databases. HCC-related targets were identified using GeneCard, OMIM, and TTD databases, and overlapping targets were analyzed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed and analyzed using Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis of key targets was performed via GO and KEGG pathways. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed the clinical relevance of core targets, and molecular docking evaluated the binding affinities between Tianjihuang components and key targets. Tianjihuang contained seven bioactive components targeting 207 genes, with 77 overlapping HCC-related targets. PPI analysis identified key targets, including AKT1, STAT3, EGFR, and ESR1, which play pivotal roles in HCC pathogenesis. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that Tianjihuang's anti-HCC effects involve multiple biological processes and pathways, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling. Molecular docking results showed high binding affinities of key components, such as quercetin and gallic acid, with core targets supporting their potential therapeutic effects.

{"text": "The transition from proliferative to functionally mature Î²-cells is a critical developmental process, yet the molecular mechanisms that coordinate this shift remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Tomosyn-2 as a key regulator of Î²-cell maturation. Tomosyn-2 expression declines with age in mouse islets, coinciding with enhanced biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and reduced Î²-cell proliferation. Genetic deletion of Tomosyn-2 improves glucose tolerance, elevates plasma insulin levels, and augments islet insulin secretion, without altering systemic insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, Tomosyn-2 interacts with syntaxin-1A (Stx1A) to inhibit insulin granule exocytosis by limiting SNARE complex formation. Transcriptomic and network analyses reveal that Tomosyn-2 loss reprograms gene expression to strengthen the coupling between insulin secretion and proliferative pathways. Its deletion also reduces Î²-cell proliferation and mass expansion, suppresses cell cycle and Akt1 signaling, and promotes Î²-cell identity, maturation, and altered islet architecture.

Here, we established a mouse model of stunted growth by feeding a low-fat, low-protein diet, followed by intervention with low, medium, and high doses of GMO. Our findings demonstrated that GMO increased body weight, body length, lean mass, fat mass, organ weight, tibial length, and femoral length in mice. Micro-CT analysis revealed that GMO promoted bone mass, enhanced trabecular number, and decreased trabecular distance, but had no significant effect on trabecular thickness. GMO promoted bone formation by increasing P1NP and Osteocalcin contents, and inhibited bone resorption by reducing CTX-I and TRACP contents. Furthermore, GMO also upregulated the expression levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and AKT1 in mice. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that GMO increased microbial diversity and promoted the relative abundance of Bacteroidota, including Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides sp.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADM-induced cardiac injury and develop a novel strategy to reduce its toxicity, focusing on exosome-mediated drug delivery. Network toxicology and molecular docking techniques were used to identify the key molecular targets involved in ADM-induced cardiac injury. A target database was constructed from public databases (ChEMBL, STITCH, Swiss Target Prediction, GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD), and Venn diagram analysis was performed to identify the shared targets between ADM and cardiac injury-related genes. A regulatory network was constructed, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses to gain insights into the biological processes involved. Additionally, exosomes were isolated from human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and loaded with ADM via electroporation. The therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of exosome-encapsulated ADM (HOC-Exos@ADM) were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models. Network toxicology analysis identified 27 shared targets between ADM and cardiac injury, including key genes such as AKT1, TP53, ESR1, and HIF1A. These genes are involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, all of which contribute to cardiac damage. The exosome-mediated delivery improved drug uptake, increased apoptosis in OS cells. In AKT1 signaling, decreased AKT1 led to cardiomyocyte damage via GSK - 3Î² and mTOR pathways. Meanwhile, exhibited a safer profile in animal models. These results suggest that exosome-based delivery can reduce ADM-induced cardiotoxicity and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with OS.", "entities": [{"entity": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "start": 1, "end": 12, "matched_text": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "start": 1, "end": 12, "matched_text": "OSTEOSARCOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BONE CANCER", "start": 36, "end": 46, "matched_text": "BONE CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ADM", "start": 134, "end": 136, "matched_text": "ADM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXOSOME", "start": 376, "end": 382, "matched_text": "EXOSOME", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 393, "end": 396, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 486, "end": 488, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TTD", "start": 667, "end": 669, "matched_text": "TTD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 840, "end": 843, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 840, "end": 843, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXOS", "start": 1180, "end": 1183, "matched_text": "EXOS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT1", "start": 1357, "end": 1360, "matched_text": "AKT1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TP53", "start": 1363, "end": 1366, "matched_text": "TP53", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESR1", "start": 1369, "end": 1372, "matched_text": "ESR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HIF1A", "start": 1379, "end": 1383, "matched_text": "HIF1A", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1414, "end": 1422, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1425, "end": 1440, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1447, "end": 1458, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1447, "end": 1458, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1496, "end": 1501, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UPTAKE", "start": 1548, "end": 1553, "matched_text": "UPTAKE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1597, "end": 1605, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GSK", "start": 1655, "end": 1657, "matched_text": "GSK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GSK", "start": 1655, "end": 1657, "matched_text": "GSK", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MTOR", "start": 1669, "end": 1672, "matched_text": "MTOR", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Thrombosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Despite the availability of anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, their clinical use is often limited by adverse effects. Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE), a traditional herbal medicine, has shown promise in alleviating thrombosis, but its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to explore the antithrombotic effects and molecular mechanisms of GbE through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments. Online databases were utilized for identifying the GbE's active components and target genes, accompanied by thrombosis-related targets. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were performed. A drug-active component-target gene-signaling pathway network and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed to determine core target genes and pathways. In vivo, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) model was established by ligating the inferior vena cava in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was adopted for evaluating the vascular endothelial structure. The levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), nitric oxide (NO), and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured, accompanied by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the PI3K/AKT pathway-related protein expression. GbE comprised 27 active components with 4727 target genes and 2462 thrombosis-related targets, with 974 shared targets, including AKT1, ALB, GAPDH, TNF, and IL6, enriched in PI3K-AKT and AGE-RAGE pathways. Molecular docking indicated strong binding of GbE's main components to core targets. In vivo, GbE significantly relieved vascular lesions of DVT rats; reduced thrombotic wet weight; increased NO, cGMP, and PGI2 levels; decreased FIB; and prolonged APTT, PT, and TT (P < 0.05). Additionally, Western blot highlighted the suppressed p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios in DVT rats. GbE alleviates thrombosis by increasing antithrombotic factors and reducing coagulation, potentially via downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling. Future studies should focus on long-term clinical trials and broader animal models to further validate GbE's therapeutic potential and explore other molecular mechanisms.", "entities": [{"entity": "THROMBOSIS", "start": 1, "end": 10, "matched_text": "THROMBOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GBE", "start": 230, "end": 232, "matched_text": "GBE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 695, "end": 698, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 695, "end": 698, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 789, "end": 792, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 823, "end": 839, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 855, "end": 861, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 855, "end": 861, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PPI", "start": 884, "end": 886, "matched_text": "PPI", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CORE", "start": 927, "end": 930, "matched_text": "CORE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS", "start": 970, "end": 989, "matched_text": "DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VENA CAVA", "start": 1044, "end": 1052, "matched_text": "VENA CAVA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CYCLIC", "start": 1191, "end": 1196, "matched_text": "CYCLIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PGI2", "start": 1248, "end": 1251, "matched_text": "PGI2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FIBRINOGEN", "start": 1278, "end": 1287, "matched_text": "FIBRINOGEN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FIBRINOGEN", "start": 1278, "end": 1287, "matched_text": "FIBRINOGEN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FIB", "start": 1290, "end": 1292, "matched_text": "FIB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "start": 1347, "end": 1360, "matched_text": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "start": 1347, "end": 1360, "matched_text": "THROMBOPLASTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTHROMBIN", "start": 1399, "end": 1409, "matched_text": "PROTHROMBIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 1430, "end": 1433, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 1473, "end": 1476, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 1478, "end": 1480, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT1", "start": 1648, "end": 1651, "matched_text": "AKT1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALB", "start": 1654, "end": 1656, "matched_text": "ALB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GAPDH", "start": 1659, "end": 1663, "matched_text": "GAPDH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TNF", "start": 1666, "end": 1668, "matched_text": "TNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL6", "start": 1675, "end": 1677, "matched_text": "IL6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RAGE", "start": 1709, "end": 1712, "matched_text": "RAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 1759, "end": 1765, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 1776, "end": 1779, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROLONGED", "start": 1962, "end": 1970, "matched_text": "PROLONGED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "COAGULATION", "start": 2177, "end": 2187, "matched_text": "COAGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT SIGNALING", "start": 2230, "end": 2242, "matched_text": "AKT SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 2281, "end": 2284, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "This study investigated the mechanism of Croci Stigma in treating immune checkpoint inhibitor(ICI)-associated myocarditis based on network pharmacology and molecular docking. Network pharmacology was employed to screen the active ingredients and molecular targets of Croci Stigma in treating ICI-associated myocarditis. The &quot;drug-ingredient-target-disease&quot; network and protein-protein interaction network were constructed to screen the key ingredients and core targets. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis showed that the mechanism was related to the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that the treatment was related to the advanced glycation end product-receptor for advanced glycation end products(AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway. Molecular docking result showed that crocins had close associations with RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase 1(AKT1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Crocins were then selected as the therapeutic drug. The mouse model of ICI-associated myocarditis was established by subcutaneous injection of porcine cardiac myosin combined with intraperitoneal injection of pembrolizumab. The results suggested that Croci Stigma reduced the spleen index but had no effect on the heart index. The electrocardiogram showed that Croci Stigma increased the heart rate and shortened PR and QRS intervals. Echocardiographic data indicated that Croci Stigma increased the left ventricular stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining results showed that Croci Stigma decreased the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating in the myocardium and alleviated myocardial fibrosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that Croci Stigma decreased the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted and lowered the levels of creatine kinase and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB. Biochemical data suggested that Croci Stigma inhibited the activities of superoxide dismutase and lactate dehydrogenase. Western blot result showed that Croci Stigma regulated the expression of myocardial AKT. The findings demonstrate that Croci Stigma may regulate AKT expression to effectively protect the cardiac tissue from ICI-associated myocarditis through antagonizing immune responses and inflammation, inhibiting oxidative stress, alleviating cardiac fibrosis, relieving cardiac block, and improving the cardiac function.", "entities": [{"entity": "MYOCARDITIS", "start": 111, "end": 121, "matched_text": "MYOCARDITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDITIS", "start": 111, "end": 121, "matched_text": "MYOCARDITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 331, "end": 334, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 354, "end": 360, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 380, "end": 386, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 380, "end": 386, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 447, "end": 449, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORE", "start": 467, "end": 470, "matched_text": "CORE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 481, "end": 484, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 481, "end": 484, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 571, "end": 580, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 585, "end": 596, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 585, "end": 596, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 602, "end": 610, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "END", "start": 740, "end": 742, "matched_text": "END", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RAGE", "start": 801, "end": 804, "matched_text": "RAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 807, "end": 823, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RAC-ALPHA SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE", "start": 899, "end": 939, "matched_text": "RAC-ALPHA SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT1", "start": 943, "end": 946, "matched_text": "AKT1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 3", "start": 950, "end": 999, "matched_text": "SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SPLEEN", "start": 1310, "end": 1315, "matched_text": "SPLEEN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 1348, "end": 1352, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "STROKE", "start": 1551, "end": 1556, "matched_text": "STROKE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "STROKE", "start": 1551, "end": 1556, "matched_text": "STROKE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIUM", "start": 1762, "end": 1771, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIUM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS", "start": 1788, "end": 1806, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "start": 1939, "end": 1959, "matched_text": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "start": 1939, "end": 1959, "matched_text": "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ALPHA", "start": 1961, "end": 1965, "matched_text": "ALPHA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INTERLEUKIN-6", "start": 1968, "end": 1980, "matched_text": "INTERLEUKIN-6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 2037, "end": 2040, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 2037, "end": 2040, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SECRETED", "start": 2056, "end": 2063, "matched_text": "SECRETED", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CREATINE KINASE", "start": 2091, "end": 2105, "matched_text": "CREATINE KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 2270, "end": 2273, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 2346, "end": 2348, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 2457, "end": 2462, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 2563, "end": 2578, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}]}

{"text": "Stevia rebaudiana, a major source of plant-derived natural low/non-calorie sweeteners (LNCSs), steviol glycosides (SGs), faces severe economic consequences due to environmental stresses like drought (D), particularly when combined with salinity (S). In the present study, integration of 936 million high-quality transcriptional reads with morpho-physiological (eight parameters) and metabolomics (targeted, untargeted) analysis has successfully explicated the combined drought and salinity (CDS) stress responses in S. rebaudiana. Interestingly, non-glandular trichomes recorded a significant growth under CDS, suggesting a potential adaptive response of stevia at 15 days after treatment (15 DAT). Additionally, unique differential gene expression recorded under CDS (9643 DEGs) emphasizes a distinct transcriptional response compared to single (D) and (S) stress in stevia. Moreover, stress-specific specialized metabolism, including sphingolipid, arginine and proline, and biosynthesis of various plant secondary metabolites revealed significant enrichment under CDS. Furthermore, root-specific significant expression of genes involved in stress response (AKT1, HAK12, P5CS), stress perception (WAK5, LRR-RLK, CERK1), and signal transduction (PP2C13, MAPKK, CML38) underscores the severity of CDS. Subsequently, the CDS-specific nucleotide variations were validated with resequencing data of contrasting susceptible and tolerant CDS stevia cultivars, confirming amino acid changes in key genes (AKT1:Pro695Ala, MAPKK5:His317Ile, HAK12:Tyr370Asn, P5CS: Lys495Arg), which suggests wider translational implications.

{"text": "HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for approximately 15% to 20% of all breast cancer cases and is typically characterized by aggressive tumor biology, an elevated risk of recurrence, and poor long-term survival [1]. Although HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab result in significantly improved clinical outcomes, the total pathological complete response (tpCR) rate remains suboptimal, particularly among hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients [2]. Neoadjuvant therapy plays a critical role in facilitating tumor downstaging in locally advanced cases and provides a valuable opportunity to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and guide adjuvant treatment. Consequently, the development of novel anti-HER2 agents and combination strategies has become a major focus of ongoing researches. Inetetamab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 with an engineered Fc domain to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, represents a promising candidate for improving treatment outcomes [3, 4]. In this issue of Cancer Letters, Zuo and colleagues present findings from a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical trial investigating a neoadjuvant regimen combining inetetamab, pertuzumab, and nab-paclitaxel (TIP regimen) in patients with early-stage or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer [5].

Patients had unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapies. In the phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts, patients had unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapies. Sac-TMT was administered by intravenous administration every 2 weeks at 2 to 12 mg/kg. In phase 2, patients with TNBC and HR+/HER2- breast cancer received sac-TMT per recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) identified in phase 1. Primary objectives were determining maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sac-TMT and establishing RDEs (phase 1) and determining ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment (phase 2).

Patients underwent conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI. Radiologists assessed clinicopathologic features and measured the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and haemodynamic parameters to differentiate HER2-zero/-low (n=129) from HER2-positive (n=82) BC (task 1) and then HER2-zero (n=90) from HER2-low (n=57) BC (task 2).

{"text": "We examined whether adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) monotherapy offers comparable overall survival (OS) to adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) monotherapy following lumpectomy in women aged â¥ 65 years with favorable early stage breast cancer. Patients aged â¥ 65 years, diagnosed with ER+/HER2-, cT1-2, N0 breast cancer, who underwent lumpectomy, were selected from the National Cancer Database (2004-2020). Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox Proportional Hazards models evaluated OS differences across RT-only and ET-only groups. The final cohort included 91,505 patients, with 11.8% receiving RT alone and 29.5% receiving ET only. Median follow-up was 67.6 months. ET-only patients were less likely to have a comorbidity score of 0 (ET 75.4% versus RT 80.8%; p < 0.001). Patients in the ET-only group had slightly larger tumors [ET 1.0 cm (0.7-1.5 cm) versus RT 0.9 cm (0.6-1.3 cm); p < 0.001] and were less likely to have grade 3 tumors (ET 7.0% versus RT 8.4%; p < 0.001). Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a higher 5 year OS for RT-only patients compared with ET-only (RT 88.9% versus ET 85.8%; p < 0.001). A similar trend was observed when stratified on the basis of age group (all log rank p < 0.05). In the adjusted multivariable analysis, RT-only remained associated with a slightly better OS than ET-only [ET ref, RT hazards ratio 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97)]. For older patients with early stage, ER+/HER2- breast cancer who undergo lumpectomy, patients receiving RT-only had a small survival advantage over patients receiving ET-only, which may or may not be clinically relevant.

However, mechanisms driving PTFs to specify collaborating transcription factor recruitment and chromatin remodeling remain unclear. Here, we utilize inducible expression of a PTF, GATA3, in a basal breast cancer cell line (SUM159PT) to mechanistically address the collaborating transcription factor requirements and the local chromatin architecture delineating GATA3-depenent chromatin accessibility and enhancer formation (productive sites) versus GATA3-bound inaccessible chromatin (unproductive sites). Transcription factor footprinting in productive sites illustrated enrichment of GATA3 with AP-1 transcription factor. Together, GATA3 and AP-1 colocalize at primed enhancers with p300 and BRG1 where nucleosome positioning is influenced by GATA3 binding. Although inhibition of AP-1 binding affects a small subset of productive sites, we demonstrate that inhibition of SWI/SNF ATPases results in dramatic loss of GATA3-dependent chromatin accessibility, binding, and alterations in local chromatin architecture. We conclude that GATA3-dependent gains in chromatin accessibility require chromatin remodeling and that accessibility at some loci is facilitated by collaborating transcription factors like AP-1.", "entities": [{"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 9, "end": 21, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 59, "end": 67, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "start": 211, "end": 230, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN REMODELING", "start": 248, "end": 267, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN REMODELING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GATA3", "start": 333, "end": 337, "matched_text": "GATA3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 351, "end": 363, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 351, "end": 363, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 365, "end": 368, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 365, "end": 368, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 566, "end": 574, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "P300", "start": 838, "end": 841, "matched_text": "P300", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRG1", "start": 847, "end": 850, "matched_text": "BRG1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NUCLEOSOME", "start": 858, "end": 867, "matched_text": "NUCLEOSOME", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 904, "end": 910, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SWI", "start": 1027, "end": 1029, "matched_text": "SWI", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SNF", "start": 1031, "end": 1033, "matched_text": "SNF", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SNF", "start": 1031, "end": 1033, "matched_text": "SNF", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn), a 140 amino acid protein, is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the erythrocytes, playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Among the GATA family transcription factors (TFs), GATA1 and GATA2 regulate the meg-erythrocytic differentiation starting from the hematopoietic stem cell. In erythropoiesis, the GATA1-2 switching regulates the expression of the Î±-syn gene (SNCA) in the erythrocytes, which is essential for iron metabolism and membrane stability. Abnormalities in Î±-syn regulation alter erythrocytic function, possibly contributing to pathological mechanisms of different synucleinopathies. In CNS, during neuronal development, GATA2 confirms its role in stemness by maintaining the ventral neuronal progenitors and also leading GABAergic, serotoninergic, and sympathetic neuron differentiation. Therefore, although no evidence is reported regarding a direct role of GATA1 in neuronal lineage, GATA3 recruitment and activation are essential for the maturation of specific neuronal subtypes.

Furthermore, PPP is comprised of 10.29% mannose, 76.96% glucose, 7.26% galactose, and 5.49% arabinose. PPP significantly curtailed tumor proliferation in S180 tumor bearing mice. It not only enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of splenocytes in these mice but also boosted the secretion of cytokines. PPP administration also led to an increased messenger RNA expression of Th1 cytokines (IL-2) and transcription factors (T-bet and STAT4) in their splenocytes. Additionally, PPP enhances the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4) and their associated transcription factors (GATA3 and STAT6) in the S180 tumor-bearing model. Moreover, PPP enhanced the secretion of inflammatory factors and chemokines in tumor tissues. Moreover, PPP markedly elevated the protein expression of Caspase 3 and Caspase 8 in tumor tissues.

(We searched in PubMed, Web of Science databases, Embase, and Medline in the English language from 1970 to October 2024. The keywords used were \"papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity\" and \"membranous nephropathy\".). A 66-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with lower extremity edema and hypertension and presented with nephrotic syndrome including hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. Enhanced CT scan showed a 3.7*3.0 cm round-like soft tissue density foci at the lower pole of the left kidney, with obvious inhomogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent a laparoscopic partial nephrectomy of the left kidney. Histologic and immunohistochemical results showed typical features of PRNRP, including a papillary structure covered by a single layer of cuboidal cells with finely grained eosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclei that were mostly regular and apically located, and GATA3 (+). The biopsy of pericarcinoma tissue showed membranous nephropathy and glomerular segmental sclerosis.

{"text": "Papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity (PRNRP), currently categorized as a papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) variant in the 5th edition of the WHO Classification, has shown increasing evidence of clinicopathological and molecular distinctions from conventional papillary RCC. Therefore, PRNRP should be separated from papillary RCC. Our analysis of 35 PRNRP cases with a mean tumor size of 15.0 mm demonstrated clinicopathological features consistent with prior reports. Uniform histological findings showed tumors with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and apically oriented low-grade nuclei, complemented by a consistent immunohistochemical profile of keratin 7 positivity and GATA3 expression. AMACR and vimentin expression were frequently negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected abnormalities in chromosomes 7/17/Y in 4 cases. KRAS mutations were identified in 23 cases. Novel observations included that cystic architecture was more frequently observed in tumors exceeding 15 mm compared to their smaller counterparts (â¤ 15 mm). Fifteen â¤ 15 mm PRNRP cases demonstrated an absence of fibrous capsule, meeting diagnostic criteria for papillary adenoma. However, comparative analysis of 45 papillary adenoma cases revealed distinct clinicopathological differences from PRNRP. These findings reinforce current proposals for distinguishing PRNRP from conventional papillary RCC. Furthermore, our data highlight a diagnostic conundrum regarding small (â¤ 15 mm) PRNRP cases lacking fibrous capsules, which challenge current diagnostic boundaries between PRNRP and papillary adenoma. Future classification should address both the separation from papillary RCC and the need to refine the diagnostic criteria of papillary adenoma.", "entities": [{"entity": "RENAL NEOPLASM", "start": 11, "end": 24, "matched_text": "RENAL NEOPLASM", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA", "start": 84, "end": 113, "matched_text": "PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA", "start": 84, "end": 113, "matched_text": "PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RCC", "start": 116, "end": 118, "matched_text": "RCC", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 196, "end": 203, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 388, "end": 392, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CYTOPLASM", "start": 554, "end": 562, "matched_text": "CYTOPLASM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GATA3", "start": 689, "end": 693, "matched_text": "GATA3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AMACR", "start": 707, "end": 711, "matched_text": "AMACR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 717, "end": 724, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 717, "end": 724, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KRAS", "start": 855, "end": 858, "matched_text": "KRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CAPSULE", "start": 1124, "end": 1130, "matched_text": "CAPSULE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PAPILLARY ADENOMA", "start": 1165, "end": 1181, "matched_text": "PAPILLARY ADENOMA", "type": "disease"}]}

A total of 41 female AMI patients were enrolled-seven premenopausal and 34 postmenopausal-and compared with a group of 17 male AMI patients. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate CD4+ T-cell subsets, including Th1 (T-bet+), Th2 (GATA3+), and Th17 (RORÎ³t+) phenotypes. Serum levels of representative cytokines were also measured. Women exhibited higher numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells compared to men, with a marked shift toward the Th1 phenotype. Postmenopausal women demonstrated increased cardiovascular risk, as indicated by higher QRISK3 and GRACE scores, as well as elevated levels of C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin T compared to premenopausal women. However, menopausal status had minimal impact on Th cell polarization, as no significant differences were observed in the proportions of Th1, Th2, or Th17 subsets between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Despite advances in understanding, the molecular regulation of bone regeneration remains incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, with growing evidence suggesting their roles in osteogenesis and fracture repair. This study investigates the role of miRNA-130b in fracture healing and its molecular mechanisms, particularly focusing on its interaction with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from rats and transfected with miRNA-130b mimic, inhibitor, or siPTEN. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin red S staining, and scratch wound healing assays. Pathway activation was evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. A rat tibial fracture model was established, and miRNA-130b mimic was administered intraperitoneally. Fracture healing was assessed via radiography, histology, and biomechanical testing at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-surgery. MiRNA-130b overexpression enhanced BMSC proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation by directly targeting PTEN and activating the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Conversely, miRNA-130b inhibition reduced osteogenic activity. MiRNA-130b mimic accelerated fracture healing, as evidenced by improved callus formation, enhanced bone mineralization, and superior biomechanical properties compared to control groups. miRNA-130b promotes osteogenesis and fracture healing by targeting PTEN and activating the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.

PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, regulates cell growth, survival, and apoptosis, and is critical for maintaining synaptic integrity. In this study, we aimed to examine the expression of MeCP2 and PTEN in individuals with SLD. RNA was isolated from blood samples, and gene expression was assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR).

These findings suggest that the dysregulation of MeCP2 and PTEN may be involved in the pathophysiology of SLD, influencing SP and neuronal function.

Potential protein targets of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were predicted using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and SwissTargetPrediction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the edgeR package. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed via STRING, and enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock to estimate PFAS-protein binding energies. PFAS-related targets were associated with dysregulation of key cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, metabolic reprogramming, and DNA repair. Core targets such as CDC20, CCND1, MYC, BIRC5, PTEN, and IL6 were identified across multiple cancers.

{"text": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rates are rising due to the increasing prevalence of cardiac metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus (DM). While revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) restore blood flow, they can also exacerbate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, for which current cardioprotective strategies remain insufficient. MicroRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression, but the role of miR-100-5p in I/R injury remains unclear. This study demonstrates that miR-100-5p is significantly upregulated in myocardial tissue during I/R injury, leading to the downregulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). This reduction in PRMT5 impairs its capacity to methylate and inactivate Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), resulting in disruption of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and aggravated myocardial damage. Using antisense oligomers to inhibit miR-100-5p, we restored PRMT5 expression, reactivated PI3K-AKT signaling, and reduced cardiomyocyte death, thereby mitigating myocardial injury.

{"text": "Sideroflexin 1 (SFXN1), a newly identified mitochondrial serine transporter, exhibits great potential to modulate mitochondrial function and promote tumor development. However, its role in bladder cancer (BLCA) remains unclear. Our study revealed that SFXN1 was enriched in clinical BLCA tissues, and high SFXN1 expression in BLCA was positively associated with the progression and poor prognosis. Further, SFXN1 deficiency remarkably suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of BLCA cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating an oncogenic role of SFXN1 in BLCA. Additionally, our results demonstrated that SFXN1 promotes metastasis through its unknown function of restraining PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1)-dependent mitophagy rather than its classical role as a mitochondrial serine transporter to mediate one-carbon metabolism. Mechanistically, SFXN1 acted as a bridge to promote PINK1 degradation by interacting with PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein) and MPP-Î² (mitochondrial processing peptidase-Î²), leading to mitophagy arrest. Notably, when mitophagy was restrained by highly-expressed SFXN1, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were considerably enriched, thus activating TGF-Î² (transforming growth factor-Î²)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoting metastasis of BLCA cells. This study highlights SFXN1 as a novel promising therapeutic target for BLCA and identifies a new mitophagic modulator to improve our understanding of an association between mitophagy and BLCA progression. Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism by which SFXN1 promotes bladder cancer metastasis by restraining PINK1-dependent mitophagy. SFXN1 is upregulated in BLCA tissues, and promotes BLCA metastasis through its unrevealed function of restraining PINK1-dependent mitophagy rather than its classical role as a mitochondrial serine transporter to promote cell proliferation. Specifically, SFXN1 acted as an essential bridging factor to promote PINK1 degradation by interacting with PARL and MPP-Î² on the IMM, leading to mitophagy arrest and mtROS accumulation, thus activated TGF-Î²-mediated EMT and promoted BLCA metastasis (This figure was created by Figdraw).", "entities": [{"entity": "SFXN1", "start": 17, "end": 21, "matched_text": "SFXN1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MITOCHONDRIAL", "start": 44, "end": 56, "matched_text": "MITOCHONDRIAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 150, "end": 154, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 182, "end": 185, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLADDER CANCER", "start": 190, "end": 203, "matched_text": "BLADDER CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BLADDER CANCER", "start": 190, "end": 203, "matched_text": "BLADDER CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PINK1", "start": 677, "end": 681, "matched_text": "PINK1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PTEN", "start": 684, "end": 687, "matched_text": "PTEN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MITOPHAGY", "start": 717, "end": 725, "matched_text": "MITOPHAGY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ONE-CARBON METABOLISM", "start": 807, "end": 827, "matched_text": "ONE-CARBON METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 888, "end": 898, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PARL", "start": 920, "end": 923, "matched_text": "PARL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 962, "end": 968, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 962, "end": 968, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MPP", "start": 975, "end": 977, "matched_text": "MPP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MPP", "start": 975, "end": 977, "matched_text": "MPP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MITOCHONDRIAL PROCESSING", "start": 983, "end": 1006, "matched_text": "MITOCHONDRIAL PROCESSING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION", "start": 1248, "end": 1280, "matched_text": "EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "start": 1884, "end": 1901, "matched_text": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EMT", "start": 2122, "end": 2124, "matched_text": "EMT", "type": "protein"}]}

Individuals with LCMN are prone to developing aggressive melanomas during childhood. Targeted therapies are needed to treat this form of melanoma and manage LCMN symptoms such as pruritus and pain, which significantly impact quality of life. Here, we present the first case of an LCMN with an NTRK fusion driver event. The patient presented with an atypical proliferative nodule arising in the background nevus. RNA sequencing of the proliferative nodule with background nevus identified a pathogenic LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. The fusion resulted in constitutive expression of TrkA, demonstrated by strong cytoplasmic pan-TRK staining, along with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as indicated by positive nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for phosphorylated ERK. The background nevus beneath the proliferative nodule also expressed pan-TRK and phosphorylated ERK, suggesting that the NTRK1 fusion occurred prior to the formation of the proliferative nodule.

The benchmark turnaround time for molecular testing is 10 days; however, send-out next-generation sequencing (NGS) can often take 14 to 28 days. The ChromaCode NSCLC assay uses a novel \"high-definition polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\" technology on digital PCR instruments to detect mutations in 9 genes derived from the most current guidelines provided by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, as well as separate testing guidelines as a collaborative effort by the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

We also analyzed 45 control xanthogranulomas by pan-TRK immunohistochemistry and targeted RNA sequencing. Slides were centrally reviewed; clinical and molecular data were collected. The 50 cases comprised 30 children and 20 adults, with a median age of 11.5 years (range 0-73 years) and a male predominance (64%). Most patients (88%) had disease limited to the skin, including a single skin nodule in 41 patients and multiple skin lesions in 3 others. Four newborns presented with skin lesions, hepatomegaly, and thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions. The 2 remaining patients had life-threatening lesions of the brain or bronchus. All cases displayed xanthogranuloma histology, often including foamy histiocytes and Touton giant cells. Histiocytes stained positive for pan-TRK in 50/50 cases, whereas all 45 control xanthogranulomas without in-frame NTRK fusions stained negative.

The most common known gene mutations affect the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways. We present a case of congenital JXG in a premature newborn from a dicygotic twin pregnancy with subdermal infiltrates on the chest, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, pancytopenia, and petechiae on the abdomen and extremities. Next-generation sequencing of tissue from a subdermal infiltrate revealed a tropomyosin 3::neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (TPM3::NTRK1) gene fusion. Therefore, a retrospective analysis of 34 additional non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (16 JXG, 3 adult xanthogranuloma and 1 benign cephalic histiocytosis, both clinical subtypes of JXG, as well as 13 Rosai-Dorfman and 1 Erdheim-Chester disease) for NTRK1, 2 and 3 aberrations was performed. This analysis revealed an NTRK1 gene fusion in 4 additional JXGs and 1 adult xanthogranuloma. In conclusion, NTRK1 gene fusions are moderately common in JXG (6/21; 28.6% in our series). This finding places JXG in the category of proliferative diseases with one of the highest frequencies of NTRK gene rearrangements. Therefore, NTRK gene fusions should be included in a gene panel test for difficult-to-treat JXG.

However, false positive staining has been addressed especially in tumors with mesenchymal origin. As a positive staining triggers reflex testing, a better understanding about pan-Trk immunohistochemistry in these tumors has become necessary. In this work, we extensively studied pan-Trk IHC in a large cohort of mesenchymal neoplasms using two antibody clones: EPR17341 (RTU Assay, Roche/Ventana) and A7H6R (Cell Signaling Technologies). Whole slide sections of 809 individual cases, including 35 subtypes of mesenchymal neoplasms, were analyzed by two different pan-Trk antibodies. Any positivity above background in > 1% of tumor cells was classified as positive. Positive stained cases were molecularly analyzed. The specificity of clone EPR17341 was 78% and showed 21.9% false positive staining (177/809). Forty-five percent (80/177) of the false positive stained cases harbored a non-NTRK-gene fusion. When comparing the two antibodies in mesenchymal neoplasms, clone A7H6R showed 80% less false positive stains compared to clone EPR17341. Additionally, three tumors harboring a NTRK1-fusion were newly identified (0.4%) and reclassified in our cohort. Our work showed a high false positive rate in mesenchymal neoplasms using clone EPR17341.

AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), which is a key subunit of SWI/SNF complexes, demonstrates critical regulatory functions as a tumour suppressor gene in cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the role of ARID1A deficiency in the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in LUAD. We identified the ARID1A mutation as a potential prognostic marker in EGFR-mutant LUAD by analysing data from cBioPortal. The expression of ARID1A was detected via immunohistochemical staining. A lentivirus was employed to construct the ARID1A knockdown model in PC9 cell. We further analyzed the biological roles of ARID1A knockdown through CCK8, flow cytometry analysis and transwell assay. The ARID1A mutation was associated with poor OS in EGFR-mutant LUAD patients, and the prognostic influence was greater than that of concurrent EGFR mutations with TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, RB1 or PTEN. By analysing the clinical data of our centre, we revealed that patients with loss of ARID1A expression demonstrated poorer median progression-free survival (mPFS, 10.3 versus 30 months, ARID1A deficiency may be an independent prognostic factor and attenuates the response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD.

The prediction of clinically relevant genetic mutations via histopathological images could facilitate the expedited identification of genetic mutations in clinical settings.

The data include whole-slide images data as well as information on gene mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, and other rare genes (ROS1, RET, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS), and related clinical information. The self-supervised model DINO and the two-stage multi-instance network GAMIL were employed to accurately identify mutation statuses in 9 genes linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The comparison of model performance involves the utilization of various foundation model (UNI), classification models (CLAM and Inception v3), external datasets (TCGA and other medical institutions), and comparative analysis with human pathologists. Our approach outperforms the CLAM and inception v3 model, achieving AUC values ranging from 0.825 to 0.987 for predicting gene mutations. The AUC value on the external test data set is 0.516-0.843. Furthermore, when comparing EGFR gene mutation prediction between pathologists and the GAMIL model, GAMIL exhibited a significantly higher AUC value of 0.810, exceeding the average AUC value of 0.508 achieved by pathologists.

{"text": "MET exon 14 skipping is an oncogenic driver observed in 1 to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MET exon 14 mutations affect splice sites and are highly heterogeneous which makes them difficult to detect. Because of the approval of capmatinib for patients with MET exon 14 mutated tumors and the related poor response to immunotherapy (ICI) for a subset of patients with MET mutated tumors, MET screening has become mandatory for first line treatment decision. Here we report our testing experience based on 1143 consecutive NSCLC addressed for molecular diagnosis. Two strategies using either DNA sequencing (NGS) and fragment analysis or DNA-RNA sequencing (NGS) were developed and validated to accurately detect MET exon 14 alterations including large deletions. For patients with MET tumors (n = 46), demographic characteristics, treatments and outcomes were obtained from medical records and discussed. 46 MET exon 14 alterations were identified, 4 were not called by DNA sequencing and rescued by fragment analysis or RNA sequencing. Sixty-seven percent tumors had a high PD-L1 expression > 50 and 42% of cases had co-occurring alterations, mainly TP53 mutations (24%) and PIK3CA mutations (9%). Response to MET inhibitors (Crizotinib and Capmatinib) was evaluated for 15 patients. The ORR (Objective Response Rate) and the median of PFS (Progression Free Survival) were 44% and 5.5 months [1.6-18.2 months] respectively. Thirteen patients were treated by immunotherapy, ORR and median PFS (Progression Free Survival) median were 30% and 4 months [0.7-55.5 months] respectively. The response to immunotherapy was not correlated with PD-L1 status but smokers seemed to better respond to ICIs. This study highlights that a multimodal approach may be necessary to detect MET exon 14 mutations as large deletions may not be detected by DNA sequencing. Targeted DNA-ARN sequencing strategies broadly interrogate the diverse druggable genomic variations and permits direct detection of altered splicing or gene fusions. Because patients with MET exon 14 mutated tumors, demonstrate low response to immunotherapy despite high PDL1 and because MET exon 14 is druggable the detection of MET mutations is mandatory to optimize treatment.", "entities": [{"entity": "MET", "start": 1, "end": 3, "matched_text": "MET", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXON", "start": 5, "end": 8, "matched_text": "EXON", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 68, "end": 93, "matched_text": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 68, "end": 93, "matched_text": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 602, "end": 604, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 652, "end": 654, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 652, "end": 654, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 757, "end": 761, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PD-L1", "start": 1086, "end": 1090, "matched_text": "PD-L1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TP53", "start": 1162, "end": 1165, "matched_text": "TP53", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PIK3CA", "start": 1187, "end": 1192, "matched_text": "PIK3CA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PFS", "start": 1348, "end": 1350, "matched_text": "PFS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SPLICING", "start": 2002, "end": 2009, "matched_text": "SPLICING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 2014, "end": 2017, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 2014, "end": 2017, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PDL1", "start": 2133, "end": 2136, "matched_text": "PDL1", "type": "protein"}]}

Following our prior report of frequent HER2 mutations in advanced uterine cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), this study expands the genomic landscape by investigating KRAS and PIK3CA as potential therapeutic targets in a cohort of 12 Taiwanese women with cervical NEC. We analyzed 12 histologically confirmed cervical NEC tumor samples from Taiwanese patients. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using a custom Qiagen GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2, a clinically relevant tumor panel to detect mutations in key oncogenes. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, followed by variant analysis to identify pathogenic alterations. Beyond HER2 mutations (41.67 %, 5/12), we detected pathogenic alterations in KRAS (16.67 %, 2/12) and PIK3CA (16.67 %, 2/12) within the same cohort. Concurrent mutations were observed in HER2/KRAS (8.3 %, 1/12) and HER2/PIK3CA (8.3 %, 1/12), indicating potential cooperative effects. This study identifies HER2, KRAS, and PIK3CA as potentially critical drivers in cervical NEC, with their co-occurrence highlighting the role of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in pathogenesis.

Gene alterations were investigated within relevant cancer pathways, and the therapeutic potential was assessed. Lastly, univariate Cox regression analyses estimated hazard ratios. Among 51 included patient, TP53 was most frequently altered (88 %), followed by PIK3CA (35 %) and CCNE1 (33 %). Separate analysis of carcinoma and sarcoma components revealed concordant gene variants but divergent copy number variations. Based on molecular classification, the majority of the cases 44 (84.6 %) had a TP53mutant profile. Additionally, 11 cases were HR deficient, and 7 samples (14 %) had high TMB (â¥16). Key altered pathways were TP53, RTK/RAS, PI3K, and cell cycle pathways. Altogether, alterations that could serve as possible molecular targets for existing therapies were identified in 45 cases (88 %).

{"text": "Ether lipids are important constituents of biological membranes and harbor fatty alcohols attached via ether linkages to the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone. Depending on the nature of the ether bond, they are subdivided into 1-O-alkyl (plasmanyl) and 1-O-alk-1'-enyl (plasmenyl) subclasses. They often contain polyunsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position, implicating them in cellular signaling and inflammatory processes including lipid mediator biosynthesis. Lipid mediators are produced by immune and non-immune cells, have diverse homeostatic and immunoregulatory functions and, together with other factors, orchestrate the initiation and resolution of inflammation. To date, alkylglycerol monooxygenase is the only known enzyme capable of cleaving alkylglycerols, one of two ether lipid subclasses. However, the exact role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase and that of its substrates in lipid mediator biosynthesis remains unclear. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate a sex- and cell type-dependent role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase in limiting prostanoid formation without affecting polyunsaturated fatty acid release, as revealed by metabololipidomics profiling of lipid mediators using ultra-performance liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry. This female-specific effect is driven by the suppression of prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 transcription, as deficiency in alkylglycerol monooxygenase significantly elevated prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 gene expression in female bone marrow-derived macrophages of the M1 phenotype. Furthermore, this regulatory role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase extends to visceral white adipose tissue, where elevated prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 expression and enhanced prostaglandin E Our results expand the immunomodulatory functions of ether lipid metabolism and highlight the sex- and cell type-dependent role of alkylglycerol monooxygenase in controlling lipid mediator production and maintaining tissue homeostasis.", "entities": [{"entity": "ETHER", "start": 1, "end": 5, "matched_text": "ETHER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "POSITION", "start": 131, "end": 138, "matched_text": "POSITION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ALK-1", "start": 264, "end": 268, "matched_text": "ALK-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 398, "end": 406, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIPID", "start": 445, "end": 449, "matched_text": "LIPID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BIOSYNTHESIS", "start": 460, "end": 471, "matched_text": "BIOSYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 670, "end": 681, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 670, "end": 681, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ALKYLGLYCEROL MONOOXYGENASE", "start": 693, "end": 719, "matched_text": "ALKYLGLYCEROL MONOOXYGENASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 836, "end": 839, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 994, "end": 996, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1003, "end": 1006, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1003, "end": 1006, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROSTANOID FORMATION", "start": 1071, "end": 1090, "matched_text": "PROSTANOID FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROSTAGLANDIN G/H SYNTHASE 2", "start": 1343, "end": 1370, "matched_text": "PROSTAGLANDIN G/H SYNTHASE 2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1372, "end": 1384, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 1484, "end": 1498, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BONE MARROW", "start": 1510, "end": 1520, "matched_text": "BONE MARROW", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PHENOTYPE", "start": 1552, "end": 1560, "matched_text": "PHENOTYPE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ADIPOSE TISSUE", "start": 1654, "end": 1667, "matched_text": "ADIPOSE TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ETHER LIPID METABOLISM", "start": 1807, "end": 1828, "matched_text": "ETHER LIPID METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 1970, "end": 1987, "matched_text": "TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}]}

{"text": "Lung cancer is widely recognized as a prevalent malignant neoplasm. Traditional genetic testing methods face limitations such as high costs and lengthy procedures. The prediction of clinically relevant genetic mutations via histopathological images could facilitate the expedited identification of genetic mutations in clinical settings. We collected 2,221 slides from 1999 patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. The data include whole-slide images data as well as information on gene mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, and other rare genes (ROS1, RET, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS), and related clinical information. The self-supervised model DINO and the two-stage multi-instance network GAMIL were employed to accurately identify mutation statuses in 9 genes linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The comparison of model performance involves the utilization of various foundation model (UNI), classification models (CLAM and Inception v3), external datasets (TCGA and other medical institutions), and comparative analysis with human pathologists. Our approach outperforms the CLAM and inception v3 model, achieving AUC values ranging from 0.825 to 0.987 for predicting gene mutations. The AUC value on the external test data set is 0.516-0.843. Furthermore, when comparing EGFR gene mutation prediction between pathologists and the GAMIL model, GAMIL exhibited a significantly higher AUC value of 0.810, exceeding the average AUC value of 0.508 achieved by pathologists. The GAMIL models exhibit outstanding performance in delineating tumor regions in lung adenocarcinoma and in forecasting gene mutations.

{"text": "Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) constitutes 10-15% of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. EFS is 70% and currently 80% with the additional of targeted agents such as CD30 directed conjugated monoclonal antibody brentuximab or ALK inhibitors such as crizotinib. Expression of CD3, a T-cell marker, can be lost or diminished in some ALCL cases. The literature is conflicting on whether CD3 expression affects prognosis, and it has been analyzed mostly in the relapse setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of CD3 expression on survival and its relation to the other prognostic variables in newly diagnosed patients with pediatric ALCL treated at a single large pediatric oncology center. A retrospective study was done on 89 newly diagnosed pediatric ALCL patients (under 18 years old) treated at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357) from July 2007 to December 2019. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to confirm the diagnosis and determine CD3 expression in tumor cells. The impact of CD3 expression on event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)) was analyzed. The median age was 10.7 years with male to female ratio 1.8:1. The majority of patients (85.4%) were ALK positive. CD3 was positive in 31 (34.8%) of patients. The median follow-up period was 60 months. The five-year OS, EFS, and RFS rates for the entire group were 84.3%, 73.1%, and 81.5%, respectively. CD3 positivity was associated with a higher incidence of CNS involvement (p=0.03) but did not significantly impact other patient outcomes (EFS, RFS and OS). However, stage, B symptoms, and skin involvement were linked to a shorter relapse-free survival. This study indicates that CD3 expression may not be a major factor predicting survival in newly diagnosed pediatric ALCL.

{"text": "Accurately identification of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) status is of paramount important, as it has been reported as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in diffuse gliomas, both IDH-mutant and IDH-wild type. Various methods are available for identifying CDKN2A deletion, with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) being the most used. However, there is currently no established threshold for identifying CDKN2A homozygous and heterozygous deletions using FISH. Herein, we retrospectively collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 100 patients with diffuse gliomas, and DNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS), FISH, immunohistochemistry (IHC)-p16, and IHC-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) were used to assess the CDKN2A status. The correlations and consistency of CDKN2A status identification across different platforms were compared, and inconsistencies and potential reasons were analyzed.. Our findings revealed a relatively high accuracy between FISH- and NGS-assessment results for CDKN2A deletion status, with an AUC value 0.937 for assessing homozygous deletion and an AUC value of 0.980 for assessment deletion overall. However, each detection method has its own advantages and limitations. Therefore, a precise detection scheme is crucial for accurately assessing of CDKN2A deletion status. Finally, we analyzed the clinical significance of CDKN2A status. In conclusion, our study utilized four platforms to comprehensively assess the status of CDKN2A in gliomas and evaluated the performance of each platform. We established cutoff values of FISH to confirm CDKN2A status.

The aim of this study is to determine the role of ARID1A deficiency in the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in LUAD. We identified the ARID1A mutation as a potential prognostic marker in EGFR-mutant LUAD by analysing data from cBioPortal. The expression of ARID1A was detected via immunohistochemical staining. A lentivirus was employed to construct the ARID1A knockdown model in PC9 cell. We further analyzed the biological roles of ARID1A knockdown through CCK8, flow cytometry analysis and transwell assay. The ARID1A mutation was associated with poor OS in EGFR-mutant LUAD patients, and the prognostic influence was greater than that of concurrent EGFR mutations with TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, RB1 or PTEN. By analysing the clinical data of our centre, we revealed that patients with loss of ARID1A expression demonstrated poorer median progression-free survival (mPFS, 10.3 versus 30 months, ARID1A deficiency may be an independent prognostic factor and attenuates the response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD.

This study aimed to reveal the relationship between cuproptosis genes and the immune microenvironment in DN and distinguish different phenotypes to describe disease heterogeneity through consensus clustering based on cuproptosis genes. We downloaded RNA sequencing data sets of DN glomerular and normal renal tissue samples (GSE142025, GSE30528, and GSE96804) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DN and control samples were screened. Immune cell subtype infiltration and immune score were figured out via different algorithms. Consensus clustering was performed by Ward's method to determine different phenotypes of DN. Key genes between phenotypes were identified via a machine-learning algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was applied to establish a nomogram for assessing the disease risk of DN. The role of related genes was verified by cell experiments. In DN samples, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3(NLRP3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A Gene(CDKN2A) were positively correlated to immune score.

Via Consensus clustering based on cuproptosis genes, the DN samples were divided into cluster C1 and cluster C2. Cluster C1 was characterized by low cuproptosis gene expression, high immune cell subtype infiltration, and high enrichment of immune-related pathways. Cluster C2 was on the contrary. Dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductase (DCXR) and heat-responsive protein 12 (HRSP12) were key genes related to clinical traits and immune microenvironment, negatively correlated with most immune cell subtypes. The nomogram constructed based on DCXR and HRSP12 showed good efficiency for DN diagnosis. Immune microenvironment imbalance and metabolic disorders may lead to the occurrence of DN. Cuproptosis genes, with the ability to regulate the immune microenvironment and metabolism, can be used for disease clustering to describe the heterogeneity and characterize the immune microenvironment.

We further investigated immunohistochemical expression of mutant TP53 and CDKN2A protein in tissues of 80 OSCC samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. Among the total 2,216 somatic variants identified in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs), we compared the high frequency mutation genes reported in OSCC in Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database with research samples, and found that TP53 (85.7%), NOTCH1 (85.7%), and FAT1 (85.7%) showed higher rate of mutation. Among single nucleotide variants, higher prevalence of C/T and G/A base change was noted. Interestingly, a distinct panel of 12 genes was detected to be mutated in 100% samples which was not previously reported compared to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP). PTPRT mutation (rs2867655) was present in seven samples and IGF2R (rs629849) was seen in two samples. A statistically significant relation was observed between mutant TP53 protein expression and duration of Naswar use and clinical stages while difference in CDKN2A protein expression was found to be statistically significant with respect to stage only. Our study presented preliminary data of genetic aberrations in patients exposed to known risk factor (Naswar).

This review examines current advancements in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of oligodendrogliomas, with an emphasis on personalized approaches driven by molecular insights. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment, aiming for maximal safe resection to obtain tissue for diagnosis and alleviate symptoms. For grade 2 tumors with residual disease but no symptomatic progression, the IDH inhibitor vorasidenib has emerged as a promising option to delay the need for radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. For grade III oligodendrogliomas, postoperative combined-modality therapy with RT and chemotherapy, such as the PCV regimen, demonstrates significant survival benefits, while temozolomide is an alternative due to its ease of administration and reduced toxicity. Recurrent oligodendrogliomas present therapeutic challenges, necessitating tailored strategies based on prior treatments and the interval since initial therapy. Options include repeat surgery, reirradiation, or novel targeted therapies. Advances in molecular diagnostics, such as homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion as a prognostic marker, have refined risk stratification and informed treatment decisions.

{"text": "To investigate the interplay among OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, the VP16 activation domain is fused to one or multiple of these factors during reprogramming. Fusion of VP16 with OCT4 and SOX2 (OvSvK) significantly increases the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation compared to other combinations. The enhanced activities of OCT4 and SOX2 directly facilitated reprogramming by activating downstream targets, some of which are involved in cell cycle regulation. This leads to a shortened G1 phase and a shift in cell cycle dynamics toward an iPSCs-like state. Further analysis reveals that these cell cycle alterations reduced H3K27me3 levels on specific genes, thereby promoting reprogramming. Consistently, knockdown of Ccnd1 and Cdkn2a (siCcnd1, siCdkn2a) as well as overexpression of Ccne1 effectively shortened the G1 phase and enhanced reprogramming efficiency.

A scoping review was conducted, including 21 independent studies. Patient data from these studies were analysed and reviewed alongside relevant biological and lifestyle factors. The studies reported standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for a second primary colorectal cancer (CRC) following a melanoma diagnosis ranging from 0.62 to 1.55, while SIRs for a second primary melanoma following a CRC diagnosis ranged from 0.89 to 1.55. Males exhibited a higher risk of developing either CRC or melanoma as a second primary cancer (SPC). An inverse relationship between age and the development of CRC was observed, with younger individuals having a higher risk. African-American populations demonstrated a higher prevalence of melanoma and CRC as SPCs compared to Caucasian and other racial groups. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and the intake of red and processed meats were associated with an increased risk of developing melanoma or CRC. Genetic mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were commonly implicated in the development of both melanoma and CRC, while mutations in CDKN2A and BRCA2 were specifically significant in melanoma. The association between melanoma and CRC incidence was confirmed through analysis of current literature and is influenced by various biological, lifestyle, and genetic factors.

In this context, we studied a cohort of 40 adult-type gliomas to analyze the concordance of three different molecular techniques, ie, FISH, NGS, and SNP array, for determining CDKN2A status and compared the results to p16 and MTAP immunostainings. The results showed that SNP array is the most reliable technique for the detection of CDKN2A HD and that p16 IHC constitutes a surrogate for the detection of biallelic inactivation of CDKN2A. p16 IHC was more accurate than MTAP IHC in detecting CDKN2A HD because a subset of CDKN2A HD gliomas did not present a deletion of the MTAP gene. IHC also allowed the detection of tumors with a hemizygous deletion of CDKN2A harboring a concomitant second molecular event on the remaining allele, ie, hypermethylation of CDKN2A promoter.

We focused on a specific type of retinal neuron homologous with primate ganglion cells, the \"sustained On alpha\" retinal ganglion cell, which plays roles in contrast sensing and binocular vision in mice. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure and dampened responses to light in male Fmr1 knockout mice. We show that decreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E-I balance. The change in E-I balance supports maintenance of circuit excitability similar to what has been observed in cortex. However, this maintenance also reshapes the tuning of this retinal ganglion cell type. These results show that loss of Fmr1 in the mouse retina affects sensory function of one retinal neuron type.

{"text": "Computational psychiatry studies suggest that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inflexibly update their expectations. Here we leveraged high-yield rodent psychophysics, extensive behavioral modeling and brain-wide single-cell extracellular recordings to assess whether mice with different genetic perturbations associated with ASD show this same computational anomaly, and if so, what neurophysiological features are shared across genotypes. Mice harboring mutations in Fmr1, Cntnap2 or Shank3B show a blunted update of priors during decision-making. Compared with mice that flexibly updated their priors, inflexible updating of priors was associated with a shift in the weighting of prior encoding from sensory to frontal cortices. Furthermore, frontal areas in mouse models of ASD showed more units encoding deviations from the animals' long-run prior, and sensory responses did not differentiate between expected and unexpected observations.

Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes. In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32 years for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs. Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with FMR1 premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2 years, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

{"text": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a preCGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Individuals with the FMR1 premutation often exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms before FXTAS onset, leading to the identification of fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). Rodent models of FXTAS show motor impairments, pathological intranuclear inclusions, and heightened anxiety. However, the early onset of neuropsychiatric features and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address the above issues, we used the doxycycline (dox)-inducible 90CGG mouse model, with transgene activation at two developmental stages: adolescence and young adulthood. Mice were evaluated in a behavioural battery to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploration, and motor coordination and learning. Next, we conducted a combination of ex vivo extracellular local field potential recordings to measure synaptic physiology and oscillatory activity in the limbic system, particularly in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vH) regions. Parvalbumin interneurons and intranuclear inclusions in the amygdala and hippocampus were investigated by immunofluorescence, while mass spectrometry and gene set enrichment were used to identify differentially expressed proteins molecular pathways. Adolescent 90CGG mice displayed early-onset hyperactivity, transitioning to heightened anxiety in young adulthood, coinciding with the accumulation of intranuclear inclusions in the BLA and vH. Electrophysiological analysis revealed augmented gamma oscillations in the vH, emerging during adolescence and persisting in young adulthood. These changes correlated with a reduction in parvalbumin interneurons in these regions, and together likely contribute to enhanced BLA excitability and impaired vH plasticity. Finally, proteomic analysis of the vH revealed altered proteins linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adolescence and anxiety/depression in adulthood, aligning well with behavioural findings. Importantly, these behavioural, electrophysiological, and cellular alterations were reversible upon transgene inactivation. This study reveals a temporal progression of CGG premutation effects on behaviour, from hyperactivity to heightened anxiety to late onset motor dysfunction. Moreover, these findings provide altered network activity in the limbic system as a putative mechanism in neuropsychiatric features of premutation carriers.", "entities": [{"entity": "FRAGILE X-ASSOCIATED TREMOR/ATAXIA SYNDROME", "start": 1, "end": 43, "matched_text": "FRAGILE X-ASSOCIATED TREMOR/ATAXIA SYNDROME", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LATE", "start": 58, "end": 61, "matched_text": "LATE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FMR1", "start": 139, "end": 142, "matched_text": "FMR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 144, "end": 147, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 144, "end": 147, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOTOR", "start": 366, "end": 370, "matched_text": "MOTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ANXIETY", "start": 438, "end": 444, "matched_text": "ANXIETY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ANXIETY", "start": 438, "end": 444, "matched_text": "ANXIETY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 729, "end": 732, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BEHAVIOUR", "start": 797, "end": 805, "matched_text": "BEHAVIOUR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LEARNING", "start": 848, "end": 855, "matched_text": "LEARNING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EXTRACELLULAR", "start": 902, "end": 914, "matched_text": "EXTRACELLULAR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BLA", "start": 1069, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "BLA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SET", "start": 1271, "end": 1273, "matched_text": "SET", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPERACTIVITY", "start": 1406, "end": 1418, "matched_text": "HYPERACTIVITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERACTIVITY", "start": 1406, "end": 1418, "matched_text": "HYPERACTIVITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER", "start": 1948, "end": 1987, "matched_text": "ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER", "start": 1948, "end": 1987, "matched_text": "ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DEPRESSION", "start": 2016, "end": 2025, "matched_text": "DEPRESSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DEPRESSION", "start": 2016, "end": 2025, "matched_text": "DEPRESSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LATE ONSET", "start": 2333, "end": 2342, "matched_text": "LATE ONSET", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LATE ONSET", "start": 2333, "end": 2342, "matched_text": "LATE ONSET", "type": "symptom"}]}

Data sets of GC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. LRGs were sourced from the MSigDB database.

Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on a median risk score. We conducted prognostic analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), immune microenvironment analysis, immunotherapy responsiveness evaluation, and drug screening in these groups. The high-risk group exhibited poorer prognosis compared to the low-risk group, as predicted by our nomogram for overall survival. Notably, the high-risk group, marked by higher stromal cell infiltration and RNA stemness scores (RNAss), showed increased susceptibility to immune evasion. In contrast, the low-risk group demonstrated better responses to immunotherapy and greater sensitivity to chemotherapy. Single-cell analysis revealed that SERPINE1 is predominantly positively correlated with immune checkpoint expression, while VSIG2 exhibits a negative correlation.

This study explores the prognostic and functional roles of PDE3B and HBB in breast cancer, focusing on their contributions to proliferation and immune microenvironment modulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and TCGA data were analyzed to identify malignant subpopulations and prognostic genes. Differential gene expression, KEGG enrichment, LASSO regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Immune infiltration was assessed using EPIC deconvolution. Functional validation included qRT-PCR, IHC, Western blot, and proliferation assays in MDA-MB-231 cells. Malignant cell type 3 exhibited the highest proliferative potential. PDE3B and HBB were identified as prognostic markers, strongly associated with poor survival and immune cell infiltration. Overexpression of these genes enhanced proliferation, while their knockout suppressed it. PDE3B and HBB drive breast cancer proliferation and immune modulation, making them promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

{"text": "Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) have a unique molecular profile compared to extracranial metastases (ECM). Description of the biological features and clinical outcomes of MBM will facilitate the design of rational therapies. We examined the mutational landscape and gene expression profiles of MBM (74 patients) and ECM (34 patients) in paired patient samples from a previously published dataset with whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We also present findings from MBM from a new cohort of 14 patients from Duke University to strengthen investigation of somatic mutations and gene expression profiles. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to compare paired MBM versus lymph node (LN) metastases and skin metastases. Relative immune cell abundance was inferred using deconvolution methods. Survival outcomes from craniotomy and associations with biological features, BRAF mutation status, and PTEN expression were assessed. GSEA found that autophagy signaling pathways are enriched in MBM versus LN and skin metastases. BRAF was the most frequently mutated clinically relevant gene in MBM and ECM, with NRAS and PTEN also frequently altered in MBM. The most strongly upregulated genes in autophagy pathways were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and hemoglobin beta (HBB). An increased proportion of immune-suppressive M2 compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in MBM and ECM was identified. There was not sufficient evidence for an association between BRAF V600 mutation status or expression and overall survival (OS) from craniotomy. The mutational landscape and gene expression of MBM from the Duke cohort resembled those previously reported in the MDACC cohort. Upregulation of autophagy pathways was observed in patient-matched MBM versus LN and skin metastases due to upregulation of two genes, GFAP and HBB.

{"text": "Neonatal mortality remains a significant public health challenge in Ethiopia, often attributed to asphyxia at birth. Helping Babies Breathe (HBB), an evidence-based neonatal resuscitation program aims to address this issue. However, the sustainability of knowledge and skills acquired during pre-service training is less understood. This study assessed the retention of knowledge and skills among midwives one year after completing the HBB pre-service training in Ethiopia. A non-randomized quasi-experimental study was conducted involving a cohort of midwifery graduates who completed HBB training during their final year. Knowledge was assessed using a multiple-choice questionnaire, while skills were evaluated using Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Data were collected immediately post-training, six months later, and one year later. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyze changes over time. Of the 60 midwives initially trained, 50 (83.3%) participated in the follow-up assessment. The median knowledge score decreased significantly from 98% immediately post-training to 74% one year later (p < 0.01). Similarly, OSCE performance declined, with 36% of participants demonstrating proficiency compared to 62% at baseline (p < 0.05). A paired t-test was performed to evaluate whether students' psychomotor skills significantly declined 12 months after initial training. The results of the analysis showed a highly significant decline in psychomotor skills during this time, with a mean difference of -2.29 (SE = 0.29; p < 0.001). This negative mean difference, with pre-test scores averaging 27.59 (SD = 2.78) and post-test scores after 12 months averaging 25.31 (SD = 2.11), indicates a noticeable drop in skill levels following training. While midwives retained moderate knowledge and skills one year after completing HBB training, significant attrition highlights the need for periodic refresher training and improved access to resuscitation tools.

{"text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are complex, heterogenous diseases caused by genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, with systemic inflammation and redox imbalance playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. However, a common mechanism that correlates the two diseases remains unclear. Here, we have used a bioinformatics approach to understand the molecular network and pathway to predict potentially common genes that can be targeted to prevent these conditions. This study used three online databases and clinical datasets on Gene Expression Omnibus. PPI network analyses, gene-ontology, and pathway analysis were done utilizing advanced bioinformatics tools such as Enrichr, String, and Cytoscape. Furthermore, candidate drug prediction was also performed using DSigDB. Bioinformatic analysis of databases and datasets identified twelve common genes (CXCL8, MMP9, IL1Î², ITGB2, SPP1, PTGS2, SOCS3, BAX, GDF15, S100A8, CCL2, and MYC) in COPD and MASLD. It revealed shared signaling pathways and gene ontology (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions) in both diseases. Five hub genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL1) were also identified, which play a significant role in COPD and MASLD. The study also predicted potential drugs against the common differentially expressed proteins using DSigDB. We performed RT-qPCR to validate the differential expression of the common genes in COPD and MASLD models, which confirmed the in-silico data. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of one of the predicted drug molecules, NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in the COPD and MASLD models, which showed significant inhibition of expression of many upregulated genes, highlighting its potential therapeutic impact.

{"text": "Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), a nuclear receptor superfamily member, plays a pivotal role in liver size regulation. Murine CAR agonist 1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) was reported to induce hepatomegaly in mice, accompanied by hepatocyte hypertrophy and proliferation. However, whether CAR activation-induced hepatomegaly is reversible and the histological changes during the reversal process remain elusive. In the current study, C57BL/6 mice were administered TCPOBOP for 5 days and sacrificed at different time points after drug withdrawal. The results showed that TCPOBOP-induced hepatomegaly required a long time to reverse, as evidenced by the liver-to-body weight ratio in the TCPOBOP group remaining significantly higher than that in the vehicle group even 120 days after withdrawal. Î²-catenin and cyclin D1 staining indicated a reduction in hepatocyte size and proliferating cells. To investigate the involved mechanisms, we measured proteins associated with hepatomegaly and liver regeneration termination. The results suggested that yes-associated protein, C-MYC, Î²-catenin, forkhead box M1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4Î± changed significantly after TCPOBOP withdrawal and functioned at different stages during reversal. Furthermore, we established an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify TCPOBOP concentration. The results indicated a long-term hepatic retention of TCPOBOP, which constantly activated CAR and led to sustained hepatomegaly after TCPOBOP withdrawal. Overall, these findings revealed the reversibility of CAR activation-induced hepatomegaly and provided new insights into the safety of CAR as a drug target. Additionally, the results highlighted the importance of considering long-term TCPOBOP accumulation in the liver to avoid potential adverse effects and experimental biases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrated that hepatic retention of 1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) is the fundamental cause of constant constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation and sustained hepatomegaly after drug withdrawal, which provided new data for the safety of CAR as a drug target and offered novel insights for CAR manipulation on liver diseases.

{"text": "Chordomas are rare, aggressive tumors of the axial skeleton with limited treatment options. Genetic alterations in SMARCB1, a tumor suppressor gene, have been implicated in poorly differentiated chordomas, but their role in typical and chondroid subtypes remains unclear. This study examined 42 chordoma samples (26 typical, 16 chondroid) for SMARCB1 genetic alterations, expression patterns, and associated pathways. SMARCB1 knockdown experiments were conducted in chordoma cell lines, followed by comprehensive transcriptome analysis. No exonic SMARCB1 mutations were identified, but heterozygous loss was observed in 3/26 typical chordomas. SMARCB1 expression positively correlated with patient survival and epithelial-mesenchymal markers. Functional studies revealed that SMARCB1 knockdown significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated enrichment of MYC targets, E2F targets, and cell cycle pathways in SMARCB1-low samples, while cellular adhesion pathways were downregulated. Notably, SLPI, LBH, and LOXL2 were significantly downregulated in SMARCB1-low samples. SMARCB1 plays an important role in chordoma progression, influencing prognosis and cellular behavior, despite infrequent genetic alterations. Its effects on key oncogenic pathways and cellular plasticity suggest potential for targeted therapies. These findings provide new insights into chordoma biology and lay the groundwork for developing SMARCB1-based prognostic tools and personalized treatment strategies.", "entities": [{"entity": "AXIAL", "start": 46, "end": 50, "matched_text": "AXIAL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AXIAL", "start": 46, "end": 50, "matched_text": "AXIAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SMARCB1", "start": 116, "end": 122, "matched_text": "SMARCB1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR SUPPRESSOR", "start": 127, "end": 142, "matched_text": "TUMOR SUPPRESSOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 144, "end": 147, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 144, "end": 147, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 217, "end": 220, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHORDOMA", "start": 296, "end": 303, "matched_text": "CHORDOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHORDOMA", "start": 296, "end": 303, "matched_text": "CHORDOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 476, "end": 479, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 476, "end": 479, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "start": 818, "end": 835, "matched_text": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MYC", "start": 913, "end": 915, "matched_text": "MYC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "E2F", "start": 926, "end": 928, "matched_text": "E2F", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 943, "end": 952, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SLPI", "start": 1049, "end": 1052, "matched_text": "SLPI", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LBH", "start": 1055, "end": 1057, "matched_text": "LBH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LOXL2", "start": 1064, "end": 1068, "matched_text": "LOXL2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BEHAVIOR", "start": 1219, "end": 1226, "matched_text": "BEHAVIOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 1284, "end": 1286, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "There is a great deal of interest in cancer stem cells (CSCs) in cancer therapy related to hallmarks of stemness and capacity for tumor relapse. Inhibition of CSCs by natural compounds represents a potential therapeutic approach. Thus, this study aimed to investigate potential effects of glyasperin A (GlyA) against CSCs by regulating possible stemness markers and signaling pathways as well. The NCCIT cell, a cell line derived from extragonadal germ cell tumors, was used as the cancer stem cell model for this study. The growth of teratocarcinoma cells under GlyA treatment in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture patterns was revealed by MTT assay. The flow cytometry analysis was accessed to determine the expression of stemness surface markers and cell cycle arrest. In addition, the immunoblotting and human phospho-kinase array were applied to determine the possible target molecules in NCCIT cells under GlyA intervention. The collected results revealed that GlyA strongly inhibited the growth of NCCIT cells. The compound made cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase. GlyA induced apoptosis by upregulating Bax and phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels. On the other hand, it also downregulated the expression of several transcription factors (Nanog, Oct4, c-Myc), which are closely correlated with stemness. Moreover, the levels of some proteins involved in the Akt/mTOR/IKK signaling pathways, which play critical roles in maintaining the self-renewal and proliferative features of CSCs, were also decreased. These results show that GlyA affects multiple targets that sustain the stemness features and proliferation or cell death of CSCs.", "entities": [{"entity": "CANCER", "start": 38, "end": 43, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 38, "end": 43, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GLYA", "start": 304, "end": 307, "matched_text": "GLYA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 367, "end": 375, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 405, "end": 408, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 405, "end": 408, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GERM CELL", "start": 449, "end": 457, "matched_text": "GERM CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "STEM CELL", "start": 490, "end": 498, "matched_text": "STEM CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TERATOCARCINOMA", "start": 536, "end": 550, "matched_text": "TERATOCARCINOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE ARREST", "start": 780, "end": 796, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE ARREST", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 1063, "end": 1072, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "S PHASE", "start": 1108, "end": 1114, "matched_text": "S PHASE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1130, "end": 1138, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BAX", "start": 1156, "end": 1158, "matched_text": "BAX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERK1", "start": 1179, "end": 1182, "matched_text": "ERK1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERK1", "start": 1179, "end": 1182, "matched_text": "ERK1", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1186, "end": 1192, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1186, "end": 1192, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HAND", "start": 1215, "end": 1218, "matched_text": "HAND", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HAND", "start": 1215, "end": 1218, "matched_text": "HAND", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1269, "end": 1281, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NANOG", "start": 1292, "end": 1296, "matched_text": "NANOG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OCT4", "start": 1299, "end": 1302, "matched_text": "OCT4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MYC", "start": 1307, "end": 1309, "matched_text": "MYC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 1411, "end": 1413, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MTOR", "start": 1415, "end": 1418, "matched_text": "MTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IKK", "start": 1420, "end": 1422, "matched_text": "IKK", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL DEATH", "start": 1669, "end": 1678, "matched_text": "CELL DEATH", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "The skin, as the largest organ of the body, plays a critical role in homeostasis and protecting against environmental stressors. Sebaceous glands (SGs) produce sebum, which forms a lipid barrier essential for preventing dehydration and defending against oxidative and microbial damage. However, ageing and environmental factors such as UV exposure and pollution impair SG function, leading to skin dryness and loss of radiance. Pterostilbene, a natural antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects, has not been extensively studied for its potential impact on ageing SG cells. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of pterostilbene on SG function under UV-induced damage and its role in collagen repair in UV-exposed fibroblasts. To examine the effects of pterostilbene on UVA-induced damage, an in vitro model of UV-exposed sebocytes was developed. The influence of pterostilbene on lipid synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and gene expression related to senescence and inflammation was assessed. In parallel, the effects of pterostilbene on collagen synthesis (types I and III) and ROS levels in UV-exposed fibroblasts were analysed. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy was utilized to visualize collagen production and F-actin integrity in fibroblasts treated with pterostilbene. Pterostilbene increased lipid synthesis by 16% and reduced ROS levels by 62.43% in UV-damaged sebocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of antioxidant genes (Nrf2, Sirt6) and downregulation of differentiation-related genes (Blimp1, c-Myc). In UV-exposed fibroblasts, pterostilbene significantly enhanced collagen types I and III levels and reduced ROS by 40.07%. High-resolution microscopy showed that pterostilbene restored the distribution of F-actin in fibroblasts affected by UVA. This study demonstrates that pterostilbene effectively protects against UVA-induced damage in both sebocytes and fibroblasts. By promoting lipid synthesis, reducing oxidative stress, and stimulating collagen production, pterostilbene presents a promising natural ingredient for anti-ageing skincare formulations. Its multifunctional mechanisms suggest its potential to enhance skin health by supporting sebaceous gland function and improving overall skin resilience. La peau est le plus grand organe du corps. Elle joue un rÃ´le essentiel dans l'homÃ©ostasie et la protection contre les facteurs de stress environnementaux. Les glandes sÃ©bacÃ©es (GS) produisent du sÃ©bum, qui forme une barriÃ¨re lipidique essentielle pour prÃ©venir la dÃ©shydratation et se dÃ©fendre contre les dommages oxydatifs et microbiens. Cependant, le vieillissement et les facteurs environnementaux tels que l'exposition aux UV et la pollution altÃ¨rent la fonction des GS, entraÃ®nant une sÃ©cheresse de la peau et une perte d'Ã©clat. Le ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne, un antioxydant naturel aux effets antiâinflammatoires, n'a pas fait l'objet d'Ã©tudes approfondies quant Ã son impact potentiel sur les cellules GS vieillissantes. Cette Ã©tude vise Ã examiner les effets protecteurs du ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne sur la fonction des GS en cas de dommages induits par les UV et son rÃ´le dans la rÃ©paration du collagÃ¨ne dans les fibroblastes exposÃ©s aux UV. MÃTHODES: Pour examiner les effets du ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne sur les dommages induits par les UVA, un modÃ¨le in vitro de sÃ©bocytes exposÃ©s aux UV a Ã©tÃ© mis au point. L'influence du ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne sur la synthÃ¨se lipidique, les niveaux d'espÃ¨ces rÃ©actives de l'oxygÃ¨ne (ROS) et l'expression gÃ©nique liÃ©e Ã la sÃ©nescence et Ã l'inflammation a Ã©tÃ© Ã©valuÃ©e. En parallÃ¨le, les effets du ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne sur la synthÃ¨se du collagÃ¨ne (types I et III) et les niveaux de ROS dans les fibroblastes exposÃ©s aux UV ont Ã©tÃ© analysÃ©s. La microscopie par fluorescence Ã superârÃ©solution a Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©e pour visualiser la production de collagÃ¨ne et l'intÃ©gritÃ© de l'actine F dans les fibroblastes traitÃ©s par ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne. RÃSULTATS: Le ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne a augmentÃ© la synthÃ¨se lipidique de 16% et rÃ©duit les niveaux de ROS de 62,43% dans les sÃ©bocytes endommagÃ©s par les UV. L'analyse de l'expression gÃ©nique a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© une augmentation des gÃ¨nes antioxydants (Nrf2, Sirt6) et une diminution des gÃ¨nes liÃ©s Ã la diffÃ©renciation (Blimp1, câMyc). Dans les fibroblastes exposÃ©s aux UV, le ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne a augmentÃ© de maniÃ¨re significative les niveaux de collagÃ¨ne de types I et III et rÃ©duit les ROS de 40,07%. La microscopie Ã haute rÃ©solution a montrÃ© que le ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne restaurait la distribution de l'actine F dans les fibroblastes affectÃ©s par les UVA. Cette Ã©tude dÃ©montre que le ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne protÃ¨ge efficacement les sÃ©bocytes et les fibroblastes contre les dommages induits par les UVA. En favorisant la synthÃ¨se lipidique, en rÃ©duisant le stress oxydatif et en stimulant la production de collagÃ¨ne, le ptÃ©rostilbÃ¨ne constitue un ingrÃ©dient naturel prometteur pour les formules de soins antiâÃ¢ge.

{"text": "Daidzin (DZN) is a natural flavonoid compound derived from soybeans that has recently been recognized for its potential antitumor properties. In traditional Chinese medicine, soybeans and their extracts are extensively used to prevent and treat various diseases. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of DZN on human glioblastoma through in vivo and in vitro experiments, and through multi-omics analyses to elucidate potential molecular mechanisms. Cell viability of LN-229 and U-87MG glioblastoma cells was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Protein and mRNA levels of proliferation and apoptosis-related genes were analyzed via Western blotting and qPCR. Metabolomics and transcriptomics identified key pathways and targets, which were confirmed by in-cell Western blotting and expression correlation analysis. The in vivo antitumor effects of DZN were evaluated in nude mice with LN-229 tumors. DZN treatment reduced cell viability, migration, and survival in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating strong antitumor effects in both in vitro and in vivo models. Multi-omics analysis identified amino acid metabolism and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis as key mechanisms. Bioinformatics highlighted LRP5 as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma. DZN decreased LRP5 activity, downregulated p-GSK-3Î², and promoted c-Myc degradation, thereby inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. In vivo, DZN significantly reduced tumor size and Ki67 expression. These findings highlight LRP5 as a promising therapeutic target, with DZN emerging as a potent LRP5 inhibitor and exhibiting significant antitumor effects in glioblastoma.", "entities": [{"entity": "GLIOBLASTOMA", "start": 317, "end": 328, "matched_text": "GLIOBLASTOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GLIOBLASTOMA", "start": 317, "end": 328, "matched_text": "GLIOBLASTOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 450, "end": 453, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 450, "end": 453, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CCK", "start": 528, "end": 530, "matched_text": "CCK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 541, "end": 547, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 541, "end": 547, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 586, "end": 594, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 699, "end": 701, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NUDE", "start": 866, "end": 869, "matched_text": "NUDE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 871, "end": 874, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AMINO ACID", "start": 1094, "end": 1103, "matched_text": "AMINO ACID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 1105, "end": 1114, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 1120, "end": 1128, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 1120, "end": 1128, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEOLYSIS", "start": 1139, "end": 1149, "matched_text": "PROTEOLYSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LRP5", "start": 1197, "end": 1200, "matched_text": "LRP5", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GSK-3", "start": 1290, "end": 1294, "matched_text": "GSK-3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MYC", "start": 1314, "end": 1316, "matched_text": "MYC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 1318, "end": 1328, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1354, "end": 1374, "matched_text": "WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 1412, "end": 1416, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KI67", "start": 1427, "end": 1430, "matched_text": "KI67", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), characterized by high molecular and pathological heterogeneity. While traditional histopathology plays a key role in LUAD diagnosis, integrating computational pathology with multi-omics analysis provides novel insights into tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics and molecular mechanisms. However, the relationship between pathological histological features and genomic instability in LUAD remains poorly understood. This study employed whole-slide images (WSIs) from the TCGA-LUAD dataset, which were processed into image patches for deep learning feature extraction using ResNet-50 and pathological feature selection using CellProfiler. Copy number variations (CNV) were inferred using inferCNV, and high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) was performed to identify key regulatory modules associated with CNV-defined malignant cell populations. Additional analyses included intercellular communication using CellChat, pseudotime trajectory inference with Monocle2, and immune landscape profiling. Finally, we performed correlation analyses between the gene expression patterns of high-CNV (HCNV) cell lines and pathological image features, followed by prognostic model construction using a machine learning benchmark framework. This study first identified LUAD malignant cells with high CNV scores. These cells also exhibited high stemness, and their proportion gradually increases with the progression of LUAD. CNV-driven tumor subpopulations exhibited distinct metabolic and immune signatures, with HCNV cells showing enhanced glycolysis, MYC signaling, and immune evasion. Intercellular communication analysis highlighted VEGF, MK and IGF signaling pathways as key mediators of HCNV-stroma interactions. A set of 192 imaging features significantly correlated with CNV burden in LUAD was identified, including 11 pathological features from CellProfiler and 181 deep learning features from ResNet-50. Machine learning-based prognostic modeling using deep learning and pathology features demonstrated robust survival prediction, with high-risk patients exhibiting lower immune infiltration and reduced immunotherapy responsiveness. This study provides a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework integrating computational pathology and single-cell multi-omics to characterize LUAD heterogeneity. By identifying CNV-associated imaging features and key molecular regulators, we propose potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targeting in LUAD. However, as this study is based primarily on retrospective bioinformatics analysis, the clinical utility of these findings requires further validation through prospective cohorts and experimental studies.

{"text": "Per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental pollutants with known bioaccumulation potential and growing evidence of association with cancer risk. However, the molecular mechanisms potentially linking PFAS exposure to carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. This study integrates computational toxicology and bioinformatics approaches to explore how PFAS-related molecular targets and pathways may overlap with those altered in six cancer types: breast carcinoma (BRCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), thyroid cancer (THCA), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), all of which have been previously implicated in PFAS-related research. Potential protein targets of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were predicted using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and SwissTargetPrediction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the edgeR package. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed via STRING, and enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock to estimate PFAS-protein binding energies. PFAS-related targets were associated with dysregulation of key cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, metabolic reprogramming, and DNA repair. Core targets such as CDC20, CCND1, MYC, BIRC5, PTEN, and IL6 were identified across multiple cancers. Molecular docking predicted strong binding energies between PFAS and several of these targets, supporting their potential relevance in cancer-associated molecular processes. This study provides a hypothesis-generating toxicogenomic framework for exploring PFAS-associated molecular alterations across cancer types.

{"text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a top cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide, with limited effective treatment options. The oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC plays a pivotal role in HCC pathogenesis by regulating key cellular processes, including proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis. Impaired c-MYC regulation strongly correlates with aberrant activation of multiple signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Wnt/Î²-catenin, and MAPK/ERK, which collectively drive tumor progression. Furthermore, c-MYC facilitates metabolic reprogramming, enhancing glycolysis and glutamine metabolism to support rapid tumor growth. Recent advances highlight the critical interplay between c-MYC and epigenetic modulators, ubiquitination processes, and non-coding RNAs, which further sustain its oncogenic activity. Targeting c-MYC through direct inhibition, pathway-specific interventions, and combination therapies stands as a compelling option for HCC treatment.

{"text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of hsa-miR-483-3p on the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in cultured human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells with known steroid response. Primary cultures of HTM cells with known steroid responsiveness [GC-responder (GC-R) and GC-Non-responder (GC-NR) cells] were grown on coverslip in 12-well plate until 80% confluence and treated with 100 nM dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h and transfected with different concentrations of synthetic miRNA 483-3p mimic or inhibitor. After 24 h or 72 h post transfection, the cells were harvested for the following experiments: (i) percentage transfection efficiency, (ii) RNA isolation for qPCR analysis, (iii) immunofluorescence staining, and (iv) protein isolation for Western blotting, respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicate with three biological samples (n = 3). GC-R HTM cells showed significantly higher expression of SMAD4 as compared to GC-NR HTM cells. Similarly, DEX treatment up-regulated the SMAD4-dependent ECM proteins. The presence of a miR-483-3p mimic down-regulated SMAD4 expression and SMAD4-dependent ECM production in a dose-dependent manner by negatively down-regulating SMAD4/TGF-Î²2 signaling. The inhibition of SMAD4-dependent ECM production by miR-483-3p was more pronounced in GC-R HTM cells as compared to GC-NR cells. The down-regulation in ECM production by miR-483-3p is SMAD4-dependent and may play a protective role in mitigating steroid response in GC-R HTM cells.

We previously identified an atypical canonical BMP signaling in dental mesenchyme that is Smad4-independent but Smad1/5-dependent. This study demonstrates that phosphorylated Smad1/5 (pSmad1/5) and Smad4 regulate distinct gene sets in dental mesenchyme. Real-time monitoring of BMP-Smad transcriptional activity revealed that Smad4-dependent canonical BMP signaling is restricted to neurovascular cells surrounding the condensed dental mesenchymal cells where pSmad1/5 is present. Notably, pSmad1/5 in dental mesenchymal cells form complexes with pSmad3 to prevent canonical BMP signaling. CUT&RUN assays revealed genome-wide co-occupancy of pSmad1/5 and pSmad3, indicating their function as transcriptional regulation units. Integrative analyses demonstrated that this atypical canonical BMP signaling regulates tooth sensory innervation and maintains odontogenic inductive potential in dental mesenchyme, enabling the identification of critical genes for maintaining tooth inductive capability.

{"text": "The 5-year overall survival rate for pancreatic cancer remains ~13%, underscoring the urgent need for improved treatment strategies. TGFÎ² is a promising target due to its significant involvement in the desmoplasia, immune suppression, and chemoresistance characteristic of pancreatic cancer. Over 300 clinical trials targeting TGFÎ² have been conducted in unselected patient cohorts; however, none of the therapies have gained FDA approval. Nevertheless, TGFÎ² blockade may hold promise for a subset of cancers with non-functional TGFÎ² signaling. Greater than 25% of pancreatic cancers carry mutations in SMAD4, a key component of canonical TGFÎ² signaling. In this study, we investigated the potential for stratifying patients based on SMAD4 mutational status to identify tumors susceptible to TGFÎ² inhibition. Analysis of SMAD4 expression in human pancreatic tumors revealed that SMAD4 mutation or loss is associated with worse disease-free survival. Intriguingly, intratumoral SMAD4 expression displayed heterogeneity among human pancreatic cancer samples. SMAD4 deficient genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic SMAD4 knockout tumor models exhibited reduced survival, increased metastasis, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment compared to SMAD4 wildtype controls, consistent with gene and protein expression changes in the absence of functional SMAD4. Importantly, treating mice bearing SMAD4 deficient tumors with a blocking TGFÎ² antibody reduced tumor weight and improved survival. These findings suggest that genomic stratification by TGFÎ² axis alterations, such as SMAD4 mutations, may be a promising approach to identifying patients likely to benefit from a TGFÎ² inhibitor.", "entities": [{"entity": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "start": 38, "end": 54, "matched_text": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "start": 38, "end": 54, "matched_text": "PANCREATIC CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FDA", "start": 429, "end": 431, "matched_text": "FDA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HOLD", "start": 476, "end": 479, "matched_text": "HOLD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 539, "end": 547, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SMAD4", "start": 608, "end": 612, "matched_text": "SMAD4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 617, "end": 619, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 934, "end": 940, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 1146, "end": 1150, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1308, "end": 1311, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1308, "end": 1311, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1317, "end": 1323, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1317, "end": 1323, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 1402, "end": 1405, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ANTIBODY", "start": 1460, "end": 1467, "matched_text": "ANTIBODY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ANTIBODY", "start": 1460, "end": 1467, "matched_text": "ANTIBODY", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Statins, widely recognized as a cornerstone in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, have garnered increasing attention in oncology due to their pleiotropic effects, particularly their potential roles in regulating breast and colorectal cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that statins may exert anticancer effects through multiple mechanisms, including the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, the LKB1-AMPK-p38MAPK-p53-survivin signaling cascade, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, modulation of the EGFR/RhoA and IGF-1 signaling pathways, and regulation of the BMP/SMAD4 signaling pathway. However, significant heterogeneity exists in the reported anticancer effects of statins, likely due to variations in statin type (lipophilic vs hydrophilic), dosage, treatment duration, and population-specific characteristics. These factors contribute to inconsistencies in study outcomes. Additionally, while combination therapies incorporating statins with chemotherapy and immunotherapy have demonstrated synergistic effects in certain studies, their clinical utility remains to be fully established. Nevertheless, current evidence suggests that statins may have a potential role in reducing breast and colorectal cancer-related mortality. Future research should prioritize elucidating their precise molecular mechanisms, defining dose-response relationships, developing personalized treatment strategies within the framework of precision medicine, and validating their efficacy through large-scale, long-term prospective studies.

Four transcription factors-PU.1, IRF8, SALL1, and SMAD4-form enhancer complexes and act as lineage-determining factors, shaping microglial identity. These factors co-bind with other lineage-determining transcription factors, directing one towards designated regions that program microglia while inhibiting the other from binding to DNA.

Here, we showed that pre-stimulation of human lung cancer A549 cells with TGF-Î² increases resistance to doxorubicin-induced growth inhibition in a Smad3- and Smad4-dependent manner. This effect was suppressed by the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor oxyfedrine, suggesting that ALDH family members are involved in drug resistance.

The TGF-Î²/Smad3 transcriptional enhancer region on ALDH1A1 was identified by Smad3 ChIP-seq analysis using an open database and by reporter assays. Knockdown of ALDH1A1 in A549 cells suppressed TGF-Î²-induced doxorubicin resistance, and lentivirus-mediated introduction of ALDH1A1 into A549 SMAD3-KO cells restored drug resistance. We also demonstrated that ALDH1A1 is required and sufficient for TGF-Î²/Smad3 signaling-induced anchorage-independent growth.

{"text": "Pancreatic cancer is still one of the deadliest malignancies, characterised by late-stage diagnosis, aggressive biology, and considerable resistance to conventional treatments. Despite improvements in understanding the molecular mechanisms and innovations in treatment, the overall survival remains abysmal: fewer than 9 % of patients survive beyond 5 years. By 2030, PC is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. owing to chemoresistance, rapid metastatic spread, and limited effective immunotherapeutic choices. This review highlights current progress in this field, including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic tools, and emerging biomarkers. Recent progress in genetic and molecular profiling has provided important information about pancreatic cancer. It has identified key mutations in genes like KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 that play a major role in driving the disease. Such revelations have provided the impetus to explore novel targeted therapies against these mutations. Furthermore, the advances in liquid biopsies incorporating circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, and exosomes hold substantial promise for early diagnosis, treatment response monitoring, and detection of minimal residual disease-any of which could radically transform PC management. While very limited options for the treatment of advanced-stage PC remain, the only potential curative treatment is surgery, yet only 10-15 % of patients are diagnosed with potentially resectable disease. Researchers are looking into new methods to help more patients qualify for surgery. This involves using chemotherapy and radiotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor before the operation. New chemotherapy treatments like FOLFIRINOX (which includes 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) have improved results for some patients, but they can still cause significant side effects. Immunotherapy, though revolutionary in other cancers, has had limited success in PC due to the tumour's immunosuppressive microenvironment. Researchers are looking into using immune checkpoint inhibitors together with chemotherapy, radiation, and drugs that target the surrounding tissue to improve the body's immune response. There is also considerable excitement surrounding personalised approaches with adoptive cell therapies such as CAR-T cells and TILs, which are trialled with early evidence of potential efficacy.

{"text": "Vocal learning, the ability to imitate sounds and a component of spoken language, is a complex convergent trait observed in only a few independent lineages of mammals and birds. Clear gene expression convergences have been found in vocal learning brain regions among several vocal learners, but amino acid convergences remain an open question. Here, we investigated whether avian vocal learning clades have amino acid convergences that could be related to their specialized trait. We developed a tool, Convergent Sequence Variant finder (CSV finder), applied to an alignment of 48 species representing nearly all bird orders, and identified convergent single amino acid variants among vocal learners and among most polyphyletic species combinations. We discovered that the numbers of convergent variants were associated with the product of branch lengths of the most recent common ancestors of each species combination. The number of convergent variants in vocal learning clades did not exceed that of control species combinations. However, a subset of genes with the vocal learner-specific variants was uniquely enriched in the 'learning' process, under positive selection, and supported by meta-analyses for FOXP2 targets, singing-induced regulation, and differential expression in song learning nuclei. Moreover, we confirmed convergent patterns were still enriched in 363 species densely sampled across the avian tree.

While most PTMCs exhibit indolent growth and a favorable prognosis, some undergo clinical progression with poor outcomes. Thus, identifying biomarkers associated with PTC, particularly those related to PTMC progression, is crucial for precise risk stratification and treatment planning. This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing on 19 surgical tissue specimens from 15 patients, including four para-tumor tissues, four non-progressive PTMCs, five progressive PTMCs, and six progressive PTCs. Key findings are corroborated through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics characterized the cellular ecosystem within PTC, revealing multi-directional evolutionary patterns as PTMC progresses. Analysis of progression-specific alterations in intercellular communication networks highlighted the PROS1-MERTK signaling interaction as pivotal in PTMC progression. In vitro and in vivo models confirm that the PROS1-MERTK axis accelerates PTMC progression via paracrine and autocrine signaling. Furthermore, NFYB and FOXP2 are identified as activators of PROS1 transcription in fibroblasts, promoting PTMC progression through the MERTK/WNT/TGF-Î² signaling.

{"text": "Vocal learning is a rare, convergent trait that is fundamental to both human speech and birdsong. The Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) transcription factor appears necessary for both types of learned signals, as human mutations in FOXP2 result in speech deficits, and disrupting its expression in zebra finches impairs male-specific song learning. In juvenile and adult male finches, striatal FOXP2 mRNA and protein decline acutely within song-dedicated neurons during singing, indicating that its transcriptional targets are also behaviorally regulated. The identities of these targets in songbirds, and whether they differ across sex, development and/or behavioral conditions, are largely unknown. Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify genomic sites bound by FOXP2 in male and female, juvenile and adult, and singing and non-singing birds. Our results suggest robust FOXP2 binding concentrated in putative promoter regions of genes. The number of genes likely to be bound by FOXP2 varied across conditions, suggesting specialized roles of the candidate targets related to sex, age, and behavioral state. We interrogated these binding targets both bioinformatically, with comparisons to previous studies, and biochemically, with immunohistochemistry using an antibody for a putative target gene. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment for human speech- and language-related functions in males only, consistent with the sexual dimorphism of song learning in this species. Fewer such targets were found in juveniles relative to adults, suggesting an expansion of this regulatory network with maturation. The fewest speech-related targets were found in the singing condition, consistent with the well-documented singing-driven down-regulation of FOXP2 in the songbird striatum.

During mitosis, multiple phosphorylation events promote FOXP2's eviction from chromatin and supplant the solubilizing function of DNA. Further, human-specific amino acid substitutions linked to the evolution of speech map to a mitotic phospho-patch, the \"EVO patch,\" and reduce the propensity of the human FOXP2 to assemble. Fusing the pathogenic form of Huntingtin to either a DNA-binding domain, a phosphomimetic variant of this EVO patch, or a negatively charged peptide is sufficient to diminish assembly formation, suggesting that hijacking mechanisms governing solubility of glutamine-rich TFs may offer new strategies for treatment of polyQ expansion diseases.", "entities": [{"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 63, "end": 69, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 63, "end": 69, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 165, "end": 177, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FOXP2", "start": 202, "end": 206, "matched_text": "FOXP2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 259, "end": 261, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RICH", "start": 289, "end": 292, "matched_text": "RICH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INTERPHASE", "start": 337, "end": 346, "matched_text": "INTERPHASE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DNA BINDING", "start": 349, "end": 359, "matched_text": "DNA BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SEQUENCE", "start": 378, "end": 385, "matched_text": "SEQUENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MITOSIS", "start": 434, "end": 440, "matched_text": "MITOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 452, "end": 466, "matched_text": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 505, "end": 513, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 557, "end": 559, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AMINO ACID", "start": 586, "end": 595, "matched_text": "AMINO ACID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 645, "end": 647, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 645, "end": 647, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HUNTINGTIN", "start": 782, "end": 791, "matched_text": "HUNTINGTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 809, "end": 815, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PEPTIDE", "start": 893, "end": 899, "matched_text": "PEPTIDE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 936, "end": 944, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Few studies have investigated alterations in the immune cell microenvironment of the dorsal root ganglia following spinal cord injury and whether these modifications facilitate axonal regeneration. In this study, we used a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset to create a comprehensive profile of the diverse cell types in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord of a mid-thoracic contusion injury model in cynomolgus monkeys. Cell communication analysis indicated that specific signaling events among various dorsal root ganglia cell types occur in response to spinal cord injury. Single-cell analysis using dimensionality reduction clustering identified distinct molecular signatures for nine cell types, including macrophage subpopulations, and differential gene expression profiles between dorsal root ganglia cells and spinal cord cells following spinal cord injury. The macrophage subpopulations were categorized into 11 clusters (MC0-MC10) based on differentially expressed genes, with the top 10 genes being ABCA6, RBMS3, EBF1, LAMA4, ANTXR2, LAMA2, SOX5, FOXP2, GHR, and APOD. MC0, MC1, and MC2 constituted the predominant macrophage populations. MC4, MC6, and MC9 were nearly absent in the spinal cord, but exhibited significant increases in the dorsal root ganglia post-spinal cord injury. Notably, these subpopulations possess a strong capacity for regulating axonal regeneration. The developmental progression of dorsal root ganglia macrophages after spinal cord injury was elucidated using cell trajectory and pseudo-time analyses. Genes such as EBF1 (MC6 and MC9 marker), RBMS3 (MC6 and MC9 marker), and ABCA6 (MC6 marker) showed high expression levels in the critical pathways of macrophage function. Through ligand-receptor pair analysis, we determined that the effects of macrophages on microglia are predominantly mediated through interaction pairs (e.g., SPP1-CD44, LAMC1-CD44, and FN1-CD44), potentially facilitating specific cellular communications within the immune microenvironment. The single-cell RNA sequencing dataset used in this study represents the first comprehensive transcriptional analysis of the dorsal root ganglia after spinal cord injury in cynomolgus monkeys, encompassing nearly all cell types within the dorsal root ganglia region. Using this dataset, we evaluated diverse subtypes of macrophages in the post- spinal cord injury dorsal root ganglia area and examined the signaling pathways that facilitate interactions among immune responserelated macrophages in the dorsal root ganglia.

{"text": "Chromatin accessibility and transcription levels during oocyte growth are important for oocyte maturation and subsequent development. However, chromatin accessibility changes in porcine oocytes during growth are unclear. The present study demonstrated that porcine oocytes derived from large follicles (LFO) exhibited higher developmental capacity than those derived from small follicles (SFO). Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis identified 1117 and 1694 uniquely accessible chromatin peaks in LFO and SFO, respectively. Motif analysis of differential peaks revealed the top 10 significantly enriched transcription factor (TF)-binding motifs in LFO versus SFO, with only one increased peak (Spi1 binding site) and nine decreased peaks (NFYA, ATOH1, ZNF549, Foxn1, HAND2, THRB, NHLH2, FoxP1, and FoxP2 binding sites). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis identified key processes in the regulation of oocyte growth and maturation. Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA sequencing data revealed the top 10 hub genes involved in chromatin remodeling (MYSM1 and EZH2), histone modification (MYSM1, RNF2, USP1, EZH2, and MIER1), and transcription regulation (MYSM1, ASXL3, and MIER1), as well as those involved in metabolic processes and signal transduction (DOCK7, FGGY, DTL, and DNAJC6). All these genes exhibited increased expression levels in LFO versus SFO. In conclusion, the study demonstrated the dynamic nature of chromatin accessibility during porcine oocyte growth and revealed the TFs and genes closely associated with oocyte growth and maturation. These findings provide new insight into porcine oocyte growth and offer a potential strategy to enhance the in vitro developmental ability of SFO.", "entities": [{"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 1, "end": 9, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 29, "end": 41, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OOCYTE GROWTH", "start": 57, "end": 69, "matched_text": "OOCYTE GROWTH", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OOCYTE MATURATION", "start": 89, "end": 105, "matched_text": "OOCYTE MATURATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 287, "end": 291, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ATAC", "start": 457, "end": 460, "matched_text": "ATAC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "start": 647, "end": 666, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 673, "end": 679, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SPI1", "start": 737, "end": 740, "matched_text": "SPI1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NFYA", "start": 782, "end": 785, "matched_text": "NFYA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ATOH1", "start": 788, "end": 792, "matched_text": "ATOH1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ZNF549", "start": 795, "end": 800, "matched_text": "ZNF549", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FOXN1", "start": 803, "end": 807, "matched_text": "FOXN1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HAND2", "start": 810, "end": 814, "matched_text": "HAND2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "THRB", "start": 817, "end": 820, "matched_text": "THRB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NHLH2", "start": 823, "end": 827, "matched_text": "NHLH2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FOXP1", "start": 830, "end": 834, "matched_text": "FOXP1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FOXP2", "start": 841, "end": 845, "matched_text": "FOXP2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 863, "end": 866, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 863, "end": 866, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 953, "end": 955, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 974, "end": 983, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 1046, "end": 1048, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 1046, "end": 1048, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HUB", "start": 1086, "end": 1088, "matched_text": "HUB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN REMODELING", "start": 1108, "end": 1127, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN REMODELING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MYSM1", "start": 1130, "end": 1134, "matched_text": "MYSM1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EZH2", "start": 1140, "end": 1143, "matched_text": "EZH2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HISTONE", "start": 1147, "end": 1153, "matched_text": "HISTONE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNF2", "start": 1176, "end": 1179, "matched_text": "RNF2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "USP1", "start": 1182, "end": 1185, "matched_text": "USP1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MIER1", "start": 1198, "end": 1202, "matched_text": "MIER1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ASXL3", "start": 1243, "end": 1247, "matched_text": "ASXL3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "start": 1315, "end": 1333, "matched_text": "SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DOCK7", "start": 1336, "end": 1340, "matched_text": "DOCK7", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FGGY", "start": 1343, "end": 1346, "matched_text": "FGGY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DTL", "start": 1349, "end": 1351, "matched_text": "DTL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DNAJC6", "start": 1358, "end": 1363, "matched_text": "DNAJC6", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited responsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or recurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an indolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the repurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to improve outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes evidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG 281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, molecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer provide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies demonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 inhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the response to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and endocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited treatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates precise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies leveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical for refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National Comprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients with hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer.", "entities": [{"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 31, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 31, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RECURRENT", "start": 156, "end": 164, "matched_text": "RECURRENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GROWTH PATTERN", "start": 240, "end": 253, "matched_text": "GROWTH PATTERN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE", "start": 280, "end": 311, "matched_text": "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KRAS", "start": 334, "end": 337, "matched_text": "KRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRAF", "start": 340, "end": 343, "matched_text": "BRAF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NRAS", "start": 346, "end": 349, "matched_text": "NRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4", "start": 579, "end": 603, "matched_text": "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CDK4", "start": 608, "end": 611, "matched_text": "CDK4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 753, "end": 765, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 753, "end": 765, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 820, "end": 825, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 820, "end": 825, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 916, "end": 923, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN", "start": 1043, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 1261, "end": 1263, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "start": 1324, "end": 1340, "matched_text": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR", "start": 1342, "end": 1362, "matched_text": "PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "start": 1395, "end": 1410, "matched_text": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 1780, "end": 1789, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOPE", "start": 2581, "end": 2584, "matched_text": "HOPE", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer, and patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma face limited treatment options due to the lack of direct NRAS inhibitors. This study explores the utilization of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to directly target NRAS-mRNA for therapeutic approaches. We designed and tested NRAS-mRNA-targeting ASOs. Experiments in melanoma cell lines and mouse models assessed effects on cell survival, apoptosis, and tumor growth. A kinase activity profiling platform identified therapeutically exploitable pathways influenced by NRAS suppression. Our research suggests that ASOs do not need to target the mutated NRAS segment to be effective. ASOs designed for the non-mutated NRAS sequence eliminate NRAS-dependent melanoma cells while sparing NRAS wild-type cells. They act independently of subcellular target localization, reduce NRAS-mRNA levels, inhibit MAPK signaling, induce apoptosis, and suppress melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Outcomes of high-throughput kinase activity mapping (HT-KAM) indicate a significant dependency between NRAS-mRNA expression and the activity of MEK1, FGFR2, and CDK4 kinases. Co-targeting these kinases enhances the antiproliferative effect of NRAS ASOs, showing synergy. These findings highlight antisense oligonucleotides as a promising therapeutic approach for NRAS-mutant melanoma. By effectively blocking NRAS-mRNA, this strategy overcomes challenges posed by the absence of a direct small molecule inhibitor for NRAS, and may offer new treatment options for patients. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Some people develop melanoma due to a change (mutation) in their DNA in a gene named NRAS. Changes in NRAS lead to cancer growth by causing a protein called NRAS to be continuously active. These patients have limited effective treatment options. Therefore, we explored a treatment that can prevent cancer cells from producing the NRAS protein. This treatment effectively killed melanoma cells whilst sparing healthy cells and reduced melanoma growth in a mouse model. It also enhanced the effect of other cancer medications. Our treatment strategy demonstrates that these people with melanoma could potentially benefit from similar therapies in the future.", "entities": [{"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SKIN CANCER", "start": 35, "end": 45, "matched_text": "SKIN CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SKIN CANCER", "start": 35, "end": 45, "matched_text": "SKIN CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NRAS", "start": 66, "end": 69, "matched_text": "NRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FACE", "start": 87, "end": 90, "matched_text": "FACE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FACE", "start": 87, "end": 90, "matched_text": "FACE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LACK", "start": 129, "end": 132, "matched_text": "LACK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 364, "end": 367, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 364, "end": 367, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 427, "end": 435, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 442, "end": 446, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KINASE ACTIVITY", "start": 458, "end": 472, "matched_text": "KINASE ACTIVITY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SEQUENCE", "start": 708, "end": 715, "matched_text": "SEQUENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ACT", "start": 798, "end": 800, "matched_text": "ACT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LOCALIZATION", "start": 838, "end": 849, "matched_text": "LOCALIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MAPK SIGNALING", "start": 885, "end": 898, "matched_text": "MAPK SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MEK1", "start": 1114, "end": 1117, "matched_text": "MEK1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MEK1", "start": 1114, "end": 1117, "matched_text": "MEK1", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FGFR2", "start": 1120, "end": 1124, "matched_text": "FGFR2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CDK4", "start": 1131, "end": 1134, "matched_text": "CDK4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 1464, "end": 1471, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 1464, "end": 1471, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 1660, "end": 1662, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1669, "end": 1672, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1669, "end": 1672, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LEAD", "start": 1702, "end": 1705, "matched_text": "LEAD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 1710, "end": 1715, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1737, "end": 1743, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1737, "end": 1743, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}]}

Pathogenic variants were identified using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification. Among the 35 CRC patients analyzed, 31.4% were < 50 years old and 60% were males. Mutation analysis showed a high prevalence of TP53 mutations in 23 patients (65.7%). KRAS mutations were detected in 19 patients (54.3%) Other mutations included PIK3CA in 3(8.6%), NRAS in 3(8.6%), EGFR in 3(8.6%), and MET in 1(2.9%). Double gene mutation (KRAS and TP53) were observed in 13 (37.1%) and (PIK3CA and KRAS) in 2 (5.71%) samples. A triple gene mutations (KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA) were found in 1 (3%) of CRC tumors.

{"text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), with a focus on the role of KRAS secondary mutations. We sought to evaluate how these mutations contribute to resistance in patients treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with cetuximab, and to explore the impact of treatment duration and disease progression on mutation rates. We retrospectively collected data from 50 mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS who received either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab). Following treatment, tumor samples were recollected through surgery, biopsy, or colonoscopy. The secondary mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF was determined via an amplification refractory mutation system. Based on the nature of the chemotherapy regimen and the presence or absence of tumor progression at the time of the second KRAS mutation analysis, patients were stratified into three groups: Group A (adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence), Group B (first-line chemotherapy without progression), and Group C (first-line chemotherapy with progression). Secondary KRAS mutations were assessed in relation to therapeutic regimens and progression profiles to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The overall rate of secondary KRAS mutations was 6.0% (3/50). These mutations were not observed in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (0/24), but occurred in 11.5% (3/26) of patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab. Stratification by treatment regimens and tumor progression showed mutation rates of 0% (0/13) in Group A, 0% (0/16) in Group B, and 14.3% (3/21) in Group C. In Group C, the mutation rate rose from 0% (0/5) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone to 18.8% (3/16) in those receiving combination therapy. Furthermore, in patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab of Group B and Group C, longer anti-EGFR treatment duration was associated with a higher mutation rate: 5.9% (1/17) in those treated for â¤ 10 months versus 25.0% (2/8) in those treated for > 10 months. Including one case of secondary BRAF mutation, the cumulative mutation rate reached 37.5% (3/8) in patients with prolonged cetuximab exposure.

{"text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of clonal plasma cells that arises from precursor conditions, including monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Disease progression is driven by a complex interplay of genetic alterations, epigenetic dysregulation, and support from the bone marrow microenvironment. Early events such as chromosomal translocations (e.g. t(4;14)), copy number abnormalities (e.g. del(17p), gain(1q)), and driver mutations in KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and DIS3 promote clonal evolution. These are complemented by non-coding regulatory mutations, aberrant splicing, and dysregulated non-coding RNAs that contribute to transcriptional reprogramming. The tumor microenvironment further supports MM progression through cytokine signaling, immune evasion, and enhanced angiogenesis. MM cells also undergo metabolic rewiring, favoring glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism to sustain growth and resist therapy. Epigenetic alterations-including DNA methylation changes, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling-shape gene expression and reinforce malignant behavior. This review comprehensively examines the genetic, epigenetic, and molecular alterations that underlie the initiation and progression of MM and its precursor states, with particular emphasis on the interplay between plasma cell-intrinsic mechanisms and microenvironmental influences.

{"text": "Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) have a unique molecular profile compared to extracranial metastases (ECM). Description of the biological features and clinical outcomes of MBM will facilitate the design of rational therapies. We examined the mutational landscape and gene expression profiles of MBM (74 patients) and ECM (34 patients) in paired patient samples from a previously published dataset with whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We also present findings from MBM from a new cohort of 14 patients from Duke University to strengthen investigation of somatic mutations and gene expression profiles. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to compare paired MBM versus lymph node (LN) metastases and skin metastases. Relative immune cell abundance was inferred using deconvolution methods. Survival outcomes from craniotomy and associations with biological features, BRAF mutation status, and PTEN expression were assessed. GSEA found that autophagy signaling pathways are enriched in MBM versus LN and skin metastases. BRAF was the most frequently mutated clinically relevant gene in MBM and ECM, with NRAS and PTEN also frequently altered in MBM. The most strongly upregulated genes in autophagy pathways were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and hemoglobin beta (HBB). An increased proportion of immune-suppressive M2 compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in MBM and ECM was identified. There was not sufficient evidence for an association between BRAF V600 mutation status or expression and overall survival (OS) from craniotomy. The mutational landscape and gene expression of MBM from the Duke cohort resembled those previously reported in the MDACC cohort. Upregulation of autophagy pathways was observed in patient-matched MBM versus LN and skin metastases due to upregulation of two genes, GFAP and HBB. In MBM, higher M2:M1 ratio may contribute to a therapeutically relevant immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).", "entities": [{"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MELANOMA", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "MELANOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 10, "end": 14, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MBM", "start": 28, "end": 30, "matched_text": "MBM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ECM", "start": 102, "end": 104, "matched_text": "ECM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 267, "end": 281, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 435, "end": 437, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 435, "end": 437, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 481, "end": 486, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 481, "end": 486, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 671, "end": 674, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 671, "end": 674, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SET", "start": 676, "end": 678, "matched_text": "SET", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LYMPH NODE", "start": 745, "end": 754, "matched_text": "LYMPH NODE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 809, "end": 812, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 809, "end": 812, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRAF", "start": 943, "end": 946, "matched_text": "BRAF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PTEN", "start": 969, "end": 972, "matched_text": "PTEN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AUTOPHAGY", "start": 1016, "end": 1024, "matched_text": "AUTOPHAGY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1026, "end": 1034, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NRAS", "start": 1179, "end": 1182, "matched_text": "NRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN", "start": 1288, "end": 1318, "matched_text": "GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN", "start": 1288, "end": 1318, "matched_text": "GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GFAP", "start": 1321, "end": 1324, "matched_text": "GFAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 1342, "end": 1345, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HBB", "start": 1348, "end": 1350, "matched_text": "HBB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 1504, "end": 1511, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Lung cancer is widely recognized as a prevalent malignant neoplasm. Traditional genetic testing methods face limitations such as high costs and lengthy procedures. The prediction of clinically relevant genetic mutations via histopathological images could facilitate the expedited identification of genetic mutations in clinical settings.

The data include whole-slide images data as well as information on gene mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, and other rare genes (ROS1, RET, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS), and related clinical information. The self-supervised model DINO and the two-stage multi-instance network GAMIL were employed to accurately identify mutation statuses in 9 genes linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The comparison of model performance involves the utilization of various foundation model (UNI), classification models (CLAM and Inception v3), external datasets (TCGA and other medical institutions), and comparative analysis with human pathologists. Our approach outperforms the CLAM and inception v3 model, achieving AUC values ranging from 0.825 to 0.987 for predicting gene mutations. The AUC value on the external test data set is 0.516-0.843. Furthermore, when comparing EGFR gene mutation prediction between pathologists and the GAMIL model, GAMIL exhibited a significantly higher AUC value of 0.810, exceeding the average AUC value of 0.508 achieved by pathologists. The GAMIL models exhibit outstanding performance in delineating tumor regions in lung adenocarcinoma and in forecasting gene mutations.

{"text": "Our Previous research revealed significant differences in exosome-mediated intercellular miR-425a-5p between normal children and those with fulminant myocarditis. We sought to elucidate the molecular underpinnings and functional implications of miR-425a-5p in the context of myocarditis progression. Bioinformatics techniques were employed to predict NRAS as the target gene of miR-425a-5p. We constructed a cellular myocarditis paradigm through LPS-mediated provocation of AC16 cardiomyocyte cultures. MiR-425a-5p was overexpressed, and the expressions of NRAS, cell apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokine profiles, encompassing IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î±, were comprehensively quantified. An experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model was created using adeno-associated virus (AAV) for miR-425a-5p overexpression. Comprehensive histopathological analyses were conducted utilizing multiple staining techniques, including hematoxylin-eosin (HE), immunohistochemical, and Masson trichrome methodologies to characterize tissue responses.

The maturity of national veterinary medicine regulatory systems varies between countries across sub-Saharan Africa and immature systems disincentivise manufacturers from bringing products to these markets. Common barriers to regulatory system strengthening identified by national regulatory agencies (NRAs) in the region include lack of financial resources, lack of trained personnel, and a need for suitable IT platforms to enable work-sharing and sharing of confidential data. Greater convergence and harmonisation of regulatory systems would enable more efficient use of resources through facilitation of regional NRA collaborations. Development of internationally agreed standards and guidance on good regulatory practice, a global regulators forum for exchange of best practice, and application of a self-assessment or audit tool, all of which exist for human medicines regulation, would enable NRAs for veterinary medicines to create and implement institutional development plans to achieve system strengthening. Independent assurance of NRA maturity would enhance opportunity for inter-agency reliance or unilateral recognition of regulatory decisions on product authorisation and good manufacturing practice inspection, currently under-utilised pragmatic approaches to ensuring necessary medicines are available quickly.", "entities": [{"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 11, "end": 20, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "QUALITY", "start": 125, "end": 131, "matched_text": "QUALITY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 190, "end": 196, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NRAS", "start": 500, "end": 503, "matched_text": "NRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LACK", "start": 528, "end": 531, "matched_text": "LACK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APPLICATION", "start": 987, "end": 997, "matched_text": "APPLICATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "UNILATERAL", "start": 1311, "end": 1320, "matched_text": "UNILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}]}

Syntaxin4 (STX4) is localized in the plasma membrane and plays a role in the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. To investigate the changes in the biological behavior and effects of STX4 gene silencing on the invasion and metastasis of OC cell lines. The proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of two groups of OC cell lines SK-OV-3 and CAOV-3 constructed with an interfering plasmid (pLVX-shRNA1-STX4-shRNA) and a negative control plasmid (pLVX-shRNA1-nonspecific-shRNA), were examined via Cell Counting Kit-8, Transwell and scratch assays. The EMT markers vimentin and E-cadherin, MMPs (MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9) and CCND1 were used to explore the possible molecular mechanism of STX4 by which STX4 affects OC cells behavior, after which the effect of STX4 gene silencing on the proliferation of OC cells in vivo was tested. After STX4 silencing, the biological behaviors of ovarian cancer cells including proliferation, migration and invasion, were significantly weakened. The results revealed that the E-cadherin, MMP2 and CCND1 levels of both OC cell lines were decreased after STX4 gene silencing. Animal models of STX4 gene silencing showed the tumorigenicity of tumor cells was reduced. We demonstrated for the first time that STX4, an important regulator of OC progression, was associated with the growth and metastasis of OC cells through correlations with EMT, MMP2, and CCND1, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic target for OC.", "entities": [{"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 14, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 14, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM", "start": 71, "end": 96, "matched_text": "FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "STX4", "start": 212, "end": 215, "matched_text": "STX4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LOCALIZED", "start": 221, "end": 229, "matched_text": "LOCALIZED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "start": 238, "end": 252, "matched_text": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "start": 238, "end": 252, "matched_text": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 266, "end": 269, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 330, "end": 335, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 330, "end": 335, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BEHAVIOR", "start": 389, "end": 396, "matched_text": "BEHAVIOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE SILENCING", "start": 418, "end": 431, "matched_text": "GENE SILENCING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 470, "end": 473, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 470, "end": 473, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KIT", "start": 745, "end": 747, "matched_text": "KIT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KIT", "start": 745, "end": 747, "matched_text": "KIT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EMT", "start": 786, "end": 788, "matched_text": "EMT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EMT", "start": 786, "end": 788, "matched_text": "EMT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 798, "end": 805, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 798, "end": 805, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "E-CADHERIN", "start": 811, "end": 820, "matched_text": "E-CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MMP1", "start": 829, "end": 832, "matched_text": "MMP1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MMP2", "start": 835, "end": 838, "matched_text": "MMP2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MMP9", "start": 844, "end": 847, "matched_text": "MMP9", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CCND1", "start": 854, "end": 858, "matched_text": "CCND1", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Despite the great advances in medicine, there is a compelling need to develop alternative strategies to effectively treat obesity with the use of plant-origin therapeutics. Cannabigerol (CBG) appears to be a novel promising compound for managing this increasingly prevalent disease requiring multifaceted pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the herein study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic properties of 2-week CBG administration on the muscular metabolism of sphingolipids as well as insulin signal transduction pathway in a rat model of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) induced by high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) were used to determine the sphingolipids content, while the multiplex assay kit was applied to measure the level of the phosphorylated form of proteins from the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The expression of various proteins engaged in the sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western blotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular content of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced the intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), redirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), respectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, inhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats. These results suggest that CBG may play an essential homeostatic role in skeletal muscles and can protect from the development of obesity-associated metabolic derangements.", "entities": [{"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 123, "end": 129, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 123, "end": 129, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CBG", "start": 188, "end": 190, "matched_text": "CBG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 275, "end": 281, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 451, "end": 460, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INSULIN", "start": 490, "end": 496, "matched_text": "INSULIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "start": 498, "end": 516, "matched_text": "SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RAT", "start": 531, "end": 533, "matched_text": "RAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "start": 556, "end": 573, "matched_text": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "start": 556, "end": 573, "matched_text": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FAT", "start": 596, "end": 598, "matched_text": "FAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KIT", "start": 841, "end": 843, "matched_text": "KIT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KIT", "start": 841, "end": 843, "matched_text": "KIT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 926, "end": 929, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 931, "end": 933, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MTOR", "start": 935, "end": 938, "matched_text": "MTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SPHINGOLIPID METABOLISM", "start": 999, "end": 1021, "matched_text": "SPHINGOLIPID METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1035, "end": 1043, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CER", "start": 1184, "end": 1186, "matched_text": "CER", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SFA", "start": 1280, "end": 1282, "matched_text": "SFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "S1P", "start": 1434, "end": 1436, "matched_text": "S1P", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EFFLUX", "start": 1491, "end": 1496, "matched_text": "EFFLUX", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 1533, "end": 1538, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "S1PR3", "start": 1553, "end": 1557, "matched_text": "S1PR3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 1636, "end": 1650, "matched_text": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1801, "end": 1804, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}]}

{"text": "Which spermatogonial differentiation states are present in prepubertal testes under normal conditions and following chemotherapy-induced depletion of spermatogonia in paediatric patients with cancer? Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals that only undifferentiated spermatogonia are present in prepubertal boys, while differentiated states emerge during puberty, with reduced protein expression of advanced spermatogonial markers observed in younger patients, those treated with alkylating agents, or those with a diminished spermatogonial pool. Paediatric oncology treatments often involve gonadotoxic therapies that can impair spermatogonial stem cells, increasing the risk of subfertility. While five distinct spermatogonial subpopulations have been identified in adult testes via single-cell RNA sequencing, their presence in prepubertal testes of childhood cancer patients remains to be confirmed through marker protein expression. Gene expression profiles of spermatogonial subpopulations were investigated using single-cell RNA sequencing data from six testicular samples of healthy boys aged 0-17 years. Protein expression patterns were examined via immunofluorescence staining in 14 biobank control samples (median age: 4.9 years; range: 0.6-13.1 years) and in 31 prepubertal testicular tissue samples of paediatric patients with cancer (median age: 6.8 years; range: 0.7-13.1 years). Gene expression profiles of UTF1 (states 0-1), ID4 (states 0-1), PIWIL4 (states 0-1), FGFR3 (states 0-2), and KIT (state 4), were analysed in testicular cells of paediatric origin obtained from our previously published open-access data source (GSE134144 and GSE120508). The protein expression of these spermatogonial subpopulation markers was evaluated by counting immunofluorescence-positive cells per analysed area. Marker expression was correlated with prior chemotherapy exposure and spermatogonia numbers. Exposure to alkylating agents was quantified as the cumulative cyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED), and anthracycline exposure as the cumulative doxorubicin isoequivalent dose equivalents (DIE). A depleted spermatogonia pool was defined as having S/T Z-scores lower than -7 SD. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that germ cells in the prepubertal testis consist solely of undifferentiated spermatogonia. The expression of KIT protein, defining differentiated spermatogonia, was positively correlated with age (P < 0.001). A reduction in the number of spermatogonia expressing ID4 protein was associated with higher CED (P = 0.001), and spermatogonia expressing KIT protein with higher CED and DIE exposure (P = 0.005, and P = 0.035, respectively). A depleted spermatogonia pool (S/T Z-score <-7 SD) correlated with fewer spermatogonia expressing ID4 (P = 0.033), FGFR3 (P = 0.050), and KIT (P = 0.051) proteins. These results indicate that distinct protein expression patterns were observed following chemotherapy-induced reduction of the spermatogonial pool, with reduced expression of ID4, FGFR3, and KIT proteins. Numbers of spermatogonia positive for markers indicating more naÃ¯ve, undifferentiated states, such as UTF1 and PIWIL4, did not correlate with spermatogonial pool reduction. The study population was heterogeneous in terms of age and treatment exposure. Moreover, the impact of specific cancer treatments could not be individually assessed. Limited tissue availability reduced the statistical power of the study, and repeated double or triple immunofluorescence staining could not be performed. As a result, the correlations between the expression of different spermatogonial markers can only be considered indicative trends. Child testicular control tissue samples were considered normal for inclusion if no testicular pathology was reported. However, detailed information on prior medical treatments or testicular volumes for the patients in this biobank was unavailable. Our observations suggest that alkylating agents have dose-dependent effects on all spermatogonial subpopulations. However, spermatogonial subtypes expressing the protein markers UTF1 and PIWIL4 were more resistant to chemotherapy-induced depletion of the spermatogonial pool, potentially representing true reserve stem cells. The identification of reserve stem cells could provide a valuable method for evaluating the fertility potential of testicular tissue collected for fertility preservation in prepubertal and peripubertal boys.

SCI rat model was constructed, after adenovirus-mediated ALKBH5 vectors and shRNA transfection and LD-LPS pre-treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin, Nissl, TUNEL staining of spinal cord tissues were adopted to monitor pathological changes, neuronal survival and apoptosis. PC12 cells transfected with ALKBH5 vectors and ALKBH5/Nrf2 siRNAs were treated by LD-LPS, followed by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 and TUNEL assays. Neuronal oxidative stress was evaluated by appraising MDA and SOD levels. ALKBH5 and Nrf2 expression was monitored through immunohistochemistry, Western blot and qRT-PCR. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation assay and Dot-blot experiment were for Nrf2 m6A modification detection, while RNA pull-down assay was for the binding validation between ALKBH5 and Nrf2. In rats with SCI, LD-LPS relieved spinal cord tissue damage and neuronal apoptosis; enhanced neuronal survival; decreased MDA content; elevated SOD activity; down-regulated ALKBH5; up-regulated Nrf2; and facilitated Nrf2 m6A methylation. These above influences by LD-LPS were eliminated by ALKBH5. Similar results were found in the OGD/R-induced PC12 cells after LD-LPS treatment. ALKBH5 significantly blocked Nrf2 m6A methylation, and pulled down Nrf2 protein. In the OGD/R-induced PC12 cells, the repressed oxidative stress and apoptosis by ALKBH5 silencing was abrogated by Nrf2 knockdown. LD-LPS might alleviate neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress after SCI by facilitating Nrf2 m6A methylation via reducing ALKBH5.

Therefore, SMAD5 may be a key regulator of BMSCs osteogenic differentiation, and its more related molecular mechanisms are worth further revealing. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein levels of SMAD5, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 53 (USP53), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3), and osteogenic differentiation-related markers. Cell counting kit 8 and transwell assay were performed to measure cell viability and invasion. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity detection and Alizarin red S staining were employed to assess osteogenic differentiation. The interactions between USP53 and SMAD5/EIF4A3 were confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation assay. The mRNA levels of SMAD5 and USP53 were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. SMAD5 silencing suppressed viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while its overexpression had opposite effects. USP53 deubiquitinated SMAD5 to stabilize its protein expression. Moreover, USP53 knockdown inhibited viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while these effects were reverted by SMAD5 overexpression. EIF4A3 stabilized USP53 mRNA expression, and the inhibitory effect of EIF4A3 silencing on viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was abolished by USP53 overexpression. Furthermore, EIF4A3 enhanced SMAD5 expression by interacting with USP53.

{"text": "There are limited data on the effectiveness of mailed self-collection to increase cervical cancer screening (CCS) participation in underresourced health care settings. To compare the effectiveness of mailed self-collection kits, with and without patient navigation, to telephone reminders to increase CCS in a safety-net health system. This pragmatic, parallel, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial within a publicly funded safety-net health system in Houston, Texas, compared (1) telephone reminder (TR) for clinic-based screening, (2) TR with mailed self-collection (SC), and (3) TR with mailed SC and patient navigation among a random sample of CCS-eligible patients not up to date with CCS, including those with no CCS on record. The trial was conducted from February 20, 2020, to August 31, 2023. All groups received a TR by a patient navigator to attend clinic-based CCS. In the SC and SC with patient navigation groups, participants were additionally mailed a self-collection kit to their home as an alternative to clinic-based CCS. In the SC with patient navigation group, the mailed kit was followed by a patient navigation telephone call. CCS participation was defined as attendance for clinic-based screening or return of a mailed self-collection kit within 6 months of randomization and determined through electronic health record review. Of the 2474 participants in the intent-to-screen analyses (median [IQR] age, 49 [39-57] years), 2325 (94.0%) were from racial or ethnic minoritized populations (1655 [66.9%] identifying as Hispanic or Latino, 82 [3.3%] as non-Hispanic Asian, 535 [21.6%] as non-Hispanic Black or African American, and 53 [2.1%] as other or unknown race, including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander), and 1388 (56.1%) were covered by the county's publicly funded financial assistance program. At 6 months, 144 of 828 participants (17.4%) in the TR group, 340 of 828 (41.1%) in the SC group, and 381 of 818 (46.6%) in the SC with patient navigation group had participated in CCS. Compared to TR, relative participation was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.99-2.80) times higher for SC and 2.68 (95% CI, 2.27-3.16) times higher for SC with patient navigation; screening difference was 23.7% (95% CI, 19.4%-27.9%) for SC and 29.2% (95% CI, 24.9%-33.5%) for SC with patient navigation. In this randomized clinical trial in a safety-net health system, SC was effective for increasing CCS participation among underscreened patients; there were modest additional gains from SC with patient navigation.

{"text": "This study aimed to elucidate the role of SLC6A6-mediated taurine transport in maintaining corneal limbal stem/progenitor cell (LSPC) function and its implications for age-associated corneal wound healing. Corneal amino acid profiles from C57BL/6J mice were analyzed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). SLC6A6 expression patterns were mapped using single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A6 with guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES) was applied in corneal wound healing models and murine corneal epithelial stem/progenitor (TKE2) cells. Transcriptomic profiling, RNA/protein analyses, and functional assays were performed in GES-treated TKE2 cells. Aged mice with corneal epithelium scraping received topical taurine supplementation (25 mg/mL, 5 times/day), and the corneas were collected for immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, TKE2 cells were treated with GES along with the Notch1 agonist valproic acid (VPA), or they were treated with taurine along with the Notch1 inhibitor GSI-IX (DAPT). The cornea exhibited high taurine concentrations, with its transporter SLC6A6 predominantly localized in LSPCs (limbal stem cells, transient amplifying cells, and basal cells) and displaying age-dependent expression patterns. SLC6A6 inhibition delayed corneal wound healing, triggered senescence pathway activation and pluripotency suppression, and downregulated stemness markers (BCAM, p63, KRT14, Wnt4) and proliferative markers (Ki67), which recapitulated key features of corneal aging. This functional decline was reversed through topical taurine supplementation. Moreover, VPA effectively reversed the inhibitory effect of GES, whereas DAPT attenuated the effect of taurine, indicating involvement of the Notch1 signaling pathway in taurine-induced LSPC maintenance.

Among the total 2,216 somatic variants identified in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs), we compared the high frequency mutation genes reported in OSCC in Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database with research samples, and found that TP53 (85.7%), NOTCH1 (85.7%), and FAT1 (85.7%) showed higher rate of mutation. Among single nucleotide variants, higher prevalence of C/T and G/A base change was noted. Interestingly, a distinct panel of 12 genes was detected to be mutated in 100% samples which was not previously reported compared to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP). PTPRT mutation (rs2867655) was present in seven samples and IGF2R (rs629849) was seen in two samples. A statistically significant relation was observed between mutant TP53 protein expression and duration of Naswar use and clinical stages while difference in CDKN2A protein expression was found to be statistically significant with respect to stage only. Our study presented preliminary data of genetic aberrations in patients exposed to known risk factor (Naswar).

{"text": "SCLC (small-cell lung cancer) is hardly treated with chemotherapy alone, even though it was initially sensitive to the drug. A novel therapeutic combination for treating diseases that have resisted typical first-line treatments is available with immunotoxin-based anticancer medicines. The use of delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) in target treatment has potential because of the high expression of DLL3 in patients with SCLC. Nanoparticles are gaining popularity in developing new therapeutics, with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) being investigated as potential cancer treatments. Emerging evidence indicates that AuNPs stabilized with chitosan (CS) have interesting biological functions. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to synthesize chitosan nanogel to deliver Rova-Typhoid immunotoxins to target cancer cells. In this research, we synthesized CS-AuNPs and CS-Rova-Typh-AuNPs and analyzed their cytotoxicity in small-cell lung (A549) cancer cells and HUVEC cell lines. Then, we evaluated the inhibitory concentration (IC50), cell cycle, and mRNA expression. Free AuNPs did not show cytotoxic effects on our cell lines; however, the inhibitory concentration of Rova-Typh immunotoxin is reduced when loaded into CS-AuNPs. Besides, immunotoxin-loaded nanogel induces late apoptosis in A549 cells and effectively induces sub-G1 cell arrest. Moreover, immunotoxin-loaded nanogel causes downregulation in DLL3, HES1, and NOTCH1 genes, which are involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Our results indicate that CS-AuNPs were an effective Rova-Typh delivery means, and Rova-Typhoid immunotoxin induces apoptosis in cancer cells through inhibiting DLL3, which is a Notch signaling ligand.", "entities": [{"entity": "CELL", "start": 13, "end": 16, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 13, "end": 16, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 28, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 28, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 120, "end": 123, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DELTA", "start": 298, "end": 302, "matched_text": "DELTA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LIGAND", "start": 309, "end": 314, "matched_text": "LIGAND", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DLL3", "start": 319, "end": 322, "matched_text": "DLL3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 554, "end": 559, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 554, "end": 559, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 582, "end": 589, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TYPHOID", "start": 763, "end": 769, "matched_text": "TYPHOID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 919, "end": 922, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 1022, "end": 1031, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 1066, "end": 1068, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LATE", "start": 1261, "end": 1264, "matched_text": "LATE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1266, "end": 1274, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HES1", "start": 1402, "end": 1405, "matched_text": "HES1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NOTCH1", "start": 1412, "end": 1417, "matched_text": "NOTCH1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1452, "end": 1474, "matched_text": "NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NOTCH", "start": 1655, "end": 1659, "matched_text": "NOTCH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 1661, "end": 1669, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}]}

All diets were isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. Fish were reared in net cages for over 90 days, and parameters including survival rate, growth metrics, muscle and liver histology, intestinal morphology, gene expression (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction), and inflammatory protein levels (Western blotting) were assessed. Survival rate was significantly higher in the BSFL61 group (p < 0.05). Growth performance was not impaired across BSFL-fed groups, although BSFL61 showed reduced body weight compared to BSFL82 (p < 0.05). Muscle fiber size, satellite cell number, and muscle triglyceride (TG) content remained unchanged. BSFL82 showed increased hepatic TG accumulation (p < 0.05) and reduced liver fibrosis, while BSFL61 exhibited a significantly lower hepatosomatic index and increased fibrosis. Intestinal villus height was reduced in BSFL34 and BSFL61, while goblet cell density increased in all BSFL groups. Notch1 expression was upregulated in BSFL61 and BSFL82, whereas ctnnb1 and wnt5a were downregulated. Inflammatory markers nuclear factor-kappa B and interleukin-1 beta were elevated in BSFL-fed groups, indicating an activated mucosal immune response. Partial replacement of marine fish with fermented BSFL enhanced ASE survival, modulated intestinal immunity, and improved mucosal barrier function, without compromising overall growth performance.

Here, a self-assembling, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanotherapeutic strategy-PHD/G-NPs-co-loaded with GSI and controlled released dihydroartemisinin (DHA), and modified with a CD38 antibody is reported. The CD38 antibody specifically targets T-ALL cells, while GSI selectively inhibits Notch1, resulting in a dual-targeting approach. GSI is released first, inhibiting Notch1 activation and inducing the death of a subset of T-ALL cells. To eliminate semi-quiescent T-ALL cells that escape initial therapy by elevating ROS levels, a ROS-sensitive DHA delivery system is employed to enhance ferroptosis and boost GSI efficacy. After elucidating the mechanism of action of PHD/G-NPs in T-ALL cells, PHD/G-NPs are combined with Î±PD-1, which triggers an anti-tumor immune response in vivo.

The Xuanfu HT increased sensitivity of HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines with overexpressed HIF-2Î±to sorafenib, and enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis by sorafenib. The component quercetin of Xuanfu HT containing serum could inhibit the binding between HIF-2Î± and the promoter of the transcription factor FOXP3 to inhibit the expression of FOXP3, so as to inhibit the activation of Notch1 pathway and angiogenesis. The expression of FOXP3 counteracted the decrease in Notch1 and VEGF expression, and angiogenic capacity induced by the combined treatment with Xuanfu HT and sorafenib. The tumor growth inhibitory effects of Xuanfu HT and sorafenib in mice were proved by constructing a subcutaneous tumor model. Xuanfu HT can increase sorafenib sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by antagonizing the Notch1 pathway through quercetin-binding HIF-2Î±.", "entities": [{"entity": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "start": 62, "end": 85, "matched_text": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "start": 62, "end": 85, "matched_text": "HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 126, "end": 129, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 126, "end": 129, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HUA", "start": 217, "end": 219, "matched_text": "HUA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CCK", "start": 376, "end": 378, "matched_text": "CCK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 500, "end": 503, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 500, "end": 503, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 563, "end": 569, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 563, "end": 569, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NOTCH1", "start": 581, "end": 586, "matched_text": "NOTCH1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 637, "end": 640, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 671, "end": 675, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 704, "end": 707, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INHIBITION OF CELL PROLIFERATION", "start": 866, "end": 897, "matched_text": "INHIBITION OF CELL PROLIFERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ANGIOGENESIS", "start": 924, "end": 935, "matched_text": "ANGIOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 1023, "end": 1029, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "start": 1071, "end": 1090, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FOXP3", "start": 1092, "end": 1096, "matched_text": "FOXP3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VEGF", "start": 1266, "end": 1269, "matched_text": "VEGF", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare epithelial ovarian cancer with limited responsiveness to conventional chemotherapy, particularly, in advanced or recurrent settings. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an indolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the repurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to improve outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes evidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG 281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, molecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer provide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies demonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 inhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the response to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and endocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited treatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates precise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies leveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical for refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National Comprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients with hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer.", "entities": [{"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 31, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OVARIAN CANCER", "start": 18, "end": 31, "matched_text": "OVARIAN CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RECURRENT", "start": 156, "end": 164, "matched_text": "RECURRENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GROWTH PATTERN", "start": 240, "end": 253, "matched_text": "GROWTH PATTERN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE", "start": 280, "end": 311, "matched_text": "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KRAS", "start": 334, "end": 337, "matched_text": "KRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BRAF", "start": 340, "end": 343, "matched_text": "BRAF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NRAS", "start": 346, "end": 349, "matched_text": "NRAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4", "start": 579, "end": 603, "matched_text": "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CDK4", "start": 608, "end": 611, "matched_text": "CDK4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 753, "end": 765, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 753, "end": 765, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 820, "end": 825, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 820, "end": 825, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 916, "end": 923, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN", "start": 1043, "end": 1071, "matched_text": "MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 1261, "end": 1263, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "start": 1324, "end": 1340, "matched_text": "ESTROGEN RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR", "start": 1342, "end": 1362, "matched_text": "PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "start": 1395, "end": 1410, "matched_text": "PROTEIN KINASE B", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 1780, "end": 1789, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOPE", "start": 2581, "end": 2584, "matched_text": "HOPE", "type": "protein"}]}

{"text": "Accurate evaluation of thyroid nodules is crucial for effective management; however, methods such as ultrasonography and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) can be subjective and operator-dependent. Indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs) complicate diagnosis, coming at the expense of time, money, and potentially additional FNA samplings, causing more discomfort for the patients. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted ultrasound diagnosis system have demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance and the potential to aid in the differentiation of ITNs. This study aims to develop an AI classifier that integrates the AI-assisted ultrasound diagnosis system, FNAC, and demographic data to enhance the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, and to compare the diagnostic performance of the models, with a focus on diagnosing ITNs. In the present research, 620 thyroid nodules were collected from a single medical center and divided into training and testing cohorts (Testing1). We developed five AI models using distinct classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine) that integrate demographic data, cytological findings, and an AI-assisted ultrasound diagnostic system for thyroid nodule assessment. These models underwent prospective validation (Testing2, n = 243) to identify the optimal model. A subsequent prospective study (Testing3) involving 70 thyroid nodules further evaluated the model's performance, where the selected optimal model was compared against FNAC combined with BRAF V600E mutation analysis. After validation with the Testing1 and Testing2 cohorts, the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated the best overall performance among the five classifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) for the RF model to diagnose thyroid nodules was 0.994 in the training cohort, 0.993 in the testing cohort, and 0.977 in the prospective data. In addition, for 42 included ITNs in the prospective data, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the RF model were 90.48%, 89.47%, and 91.30%, respectively. In the Testing 3 cohort, the RF model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to both the standalone AI ultrasound auxiliary diagnostic system and FNAC alone.

This retrospective study enrolled patients with thyroid nodules who underwent CNB at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, from July 2022 to July 2024. CNB diagnoses were classified using the Korean Thyroid Association Criteria. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated for neoplastic and malignant lesions, both independently and with BRAF V600E and RAS Q61R IHC. The correlation between nodule size and postoperative diagnosis was also analyzed. A total of 338 thyroid nodule samples was included, and 52.7% were classified as CNB category II. In the 104 samples with postoperative diagnoses, category IV was the most prevalent (39.4%). CNB demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 100% for neoplastic lesions and 23.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for malignant lesions. Combining CNB with BRAF V600E and RAS Q1R IHC increased the sensitivity to 77% for neoplastic lesions and 28.8% for malignant lesions. Larger nodules (>3 cm) were significantly associated with neoplastic (p = .005) and malignant lesions (p = .004).

{"text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), with a focus on the role of KRAS secondary mutations. We sought to evaluate how these mutations contribute to resistance in patients treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with cetuximab, and to explore the impact of treatment duration and disease progression on mutation rates. We retrospectively collected data from 50 mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS who received either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab). Following treatment, tumor samples were recollected through surgery, biopsy, or colonoscopy. The secondary mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF was determined via an amplification refractory mutation system. Based on the nature of the chemotherapy regimen and the presence or absence of tumor progression at the time of the second KRAS mutation analysis, patients were stratified into three groups: Group A (adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence), Group B (first-line chemotherapy without progression), and Group C (first-line chemotherapy with progression). Secondary KRAS mutations were assessed in relation to therapeutic regimens and progression profiles to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The overall rate of secondary KRAS mutations was 6.0% (3/50). These mutations were not observed in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (0/24), but occurred in 11.5% (3/26) of patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab. Stratification by treatment regimens and tumor progression showed mutation rates of 0% (0/13) in Group A, 0% (0/16) in Group B, and 14.3% (3/21) in Group C. In Group C, the mutation rate rose from 0% (0/5) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone to 18.8% (3/16) in those receiving combination therapy. Furthermore, in patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab of Group B and Group C, longer anti-EGFR treatment duration was associated with a higher mutation rate: 5.9% (1/17) in those treated for â¤ 10 months versus 25.0% (2/8) in those treated for > 10 months. Including one case of secondary BRAF mutation, the cumulative mutation rate reached 37.5% (3/8) in patients with prolonged cetuximab exposure.

{"text": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) is a commonly over-expressed oncoprotein in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Nonetheless, HER2-blocking agents have failed to significantly improve the outcome for OAC patients, despite achieving striking clinical success in breast cancer. To address this conundrum, we investigated how resistance progressively emerges when HER2 is targeted. We discovered that OAC cell lines that are capable of surviving in the presence of the dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib exhibit a significant increase in the protein level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Indeed, NRF2 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effect of lapatinib, while increased NRF2 expression in OAC cells reduced their sensitivity to HER inhibition. Furthermore, prolonged overexpression of NRF2 made OAC cell lines increasingly dependent on NRF2 for growth. Further analyses indicated that the activation of NRF2-mediated transcription that was associated with lapatinib-induced persistent and resistant phenotypes coincided with a subsequent increase in glutathione metabolism. Importantly, lapatinib resistant OAC xenografts become exquisitely sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of the NRF2 pathway. Together, these findings highlight a promising therapeutic strategy for treating refractory OAC by targeting the NRF2 pathway in combination with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition.", "entities": [{"entity": "EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR", "start": 11, "end": 42, "matched_text": "EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HER2", "start": 47, "end": 50, "matched_text": "HER2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERBB2", "start": 67, "end": 71, "matched_text": "ERBB2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA", "start": 118, "end": 143, "matched_text": "OESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 300, "end": 312, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 300, "end": 312, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 358, "end": 360, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 441, "end": 444, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 441, "end": 444, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HER1", "start": 510, "end": 513, "matched_text": "HER1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KINASE INHIBITOR", "start": 529, "end": 544, "matched_text": "KINASE INHIBITOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 594, "end": 600, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 594, "end": 600, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID 2-RELATED FACTOR 2", "start": 611, "end": 653, "matched_text": "NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID 2-RELATED FACTOR 2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NRF2", "start": 656, "end": 659, "matched_text": "NRF2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROLONGED", "start": 833, "end": 841, "matched_text": "PROLONGED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 993, "end": 1005, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GLUTATHIONE METABOLISM", "start": 1126, "end": 1147, "matched_text": "GLUTATHIONE METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "REFRACTORY", "start": 1359, "end": 1368, "matched_text": "REFRACTORY", "type": "symptom"}]}
{"text": "Treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has seen the rise of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs). However, their therapeutic effectiveness is severely limited by the emergence of resistance. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-independent survival pathways, extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated drug sequestration, lysosomal exocytosis, and metabolic reprogramming mediated by METTL1 (methyltransferase-like protein 1) are some of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie RTKI resistance in OSCC. In this line, specific resistance methods are carefully studied, including the signaling processes involving SHP2, the different ways ErbB2 and AKT, and features related to tumor stemness. Additionally, the interaction between resistance and the tumor microenvironment (TME), namely via EVs and modified angiogenic signaling, is emphasized. Novel therapy approaches are put forth to address these issues. The effectiveness of treatment may be improved by combination treatments that include RTKIs with other medications, such as mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapies. Innovative nanotechnology-based strategies, such as exosome-based drug carriers and liposomal drug delivery systems, provide encouraging answers for overcoming resistance and enhancing precise targeting. Furthermore, phytochemicals and herbal remedies are investigated as supplementary approaches to enhance RTKI responses. Despite the potential of these approaches, obstacles, including resolving tumor heterogeneity, limiting off-target effects, and improving delivery methods, continue to be major obstacles to clinical use. To inform personalized medicine strategies, future studies should concentrate on finding predictive biomarkers and conducting thorough preclinical validation.

We solved high-resolution crystal structures of clinically frequent ex20ins mutants to better understand how to achieve mutant-selective inhibition. Analyses of these structures demonstrate targetable ex20ins-mutant-biased dynamic protein states. To exploit these findings, we designed STX-721, an irreversible EGFR/ERBB2 ex20ins-mutant-selective inhibitor, and characterized its activity relative to clinical phase benchmarks across multiple preclinical assays. Structural analyses predict that STX-721 takes advantage of ex20ins-mutant-selective dynamic states.

These challenges include drug resistance and side effects, which severely hamper the effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies. An increasing number of herbal formulas have been utilized in antitumor therapy, owing to their cost-effectiveness, beneficial efficacy, and additional advantages. FuZhengXiaoJi Decoction (FZXJD), a cancer-treating formula, has been successfully applied in NSCLC clinical treatment, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, this paper integrated multiple analytical methods, including network pharmacology, metabolomics, biological approaches, and molecular docking to clarify how FZXJD suppresses NSCLC. This study assessed the anti-NSCLC efficacy of FZXJD using in vitro assays and lung cancer xenograft models, and the primary components and potential mechanisms of FZXJD inhibition of NSCLC were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and network pharmacology. Subsequently, inhibitory mechanisms of FZXJD and its principal effector component oleanolic acid (OA) on NSCLC were explored by molecular docking, as well as biological experiments. Finally, effects of FZXJD on critical metabolic pathways in tumors were further investigated by metabolomics and metabolite enrichment analysis. Inhibition of FZXJD on NSCLC cells was confirmed in vitro experiments. Correspondingly, in vivo experiments revealed that FZXJD impeded tumor progression without obvious toxic side effects. Network pharmacology and molecular docking disclosed that target genes involved in FZXJD's inhibition of NSCLC were significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. Additionally, 14 core genes (HSP90AA1, VEGFA, AKT1, JUN, EGFR, CASP3, ESR1, ERBB2, STAT3, MTOR, SRC, MDM2, CCND1, MAPK3) as well as the main component of the antitumor effect of FZXJD, the OA, were also identified. Biological experiments and molecular docking demonstrated that FZXJD and OA exerted antitumor effects by inhibiting two significant pathways, PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK. Metabolomics analysis indicated that FZXJD treatment suppressed glutathione metabolism in vivo. FZXJD and its main active ingredient, OA, impede NSCLC progression by inhibiting PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. FZXJD treatment also markedly attenuates glutathione metabolism. This research provides a promising strategy for the application of herbal formulas in NSCLC.", "entities": [{"entity": "MALIGNANT TUMOR", "start": 6, "end": 20, "matched_text": "MALIGNANT TUMOR", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 85, "end": 110, "matched_text": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "start": 85, "end": 110, "matched_text": "NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "start": 204, "end": 218, "matched_text": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "start": 204, "end": 218, "matched_text": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 512, "end": 517, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 806, "end": 808, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 913, "end": 923, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUNG CANCER", "start": 913, "end": 923, "matched_text": "LUNG CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 1778, "end": 1781, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 1783, "end": 1785, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERK", "start": 1791, "end": 1793, "matched_text": "ERK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERK", "start": 1791, "end": 1793, "matched_text": "ERK", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MAPK SIGNALING", "start": 1795, "end": 1808, "matched_text": "MAPK SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CORE", "start": 1837, "end": 1840, "matched_text": "CORE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HSP90AA1", "start": 1849, "end": 1856, "matched_text": "HSP90AA1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VEGFA", "start": 1859, "end": 1863, "matched_text": "VEGFA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AKT1", "start": 1866, "end": 1869, "matched_text": "AKT1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "JUN", "start": 1872, "end": 1874, "matched_text": "JUN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 1877, "end": 1880, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EGFR", "start": 1877, "end": 1880, "matched_text": "EGFR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CASP3", "start": 1883, "end": 1887, "matched_text": "CASP3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ESR1", "start": 1890, "end": 1893, "matched_text": "ESR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ERBB2", "start": 1896, "end": 1900, "matched_text": "ERBB2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "STAT3", "start": 1903, "end": 1907, "matched_text": "STAT3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MTOR", "start": 1910, "end": 1913, "matched_text": "MTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SRC", "start": 1916, "end": 1918, "matched_text": "SRC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MDM2", "start": 1921, "end": 1924, "matched_text": "MDM2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CCND1", "start": 1927, "end": 1931, "matched_text": "CCND1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAPK3", "start": 1934, "end": 1938, "matched_text": "MAPK3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 1956, "end": 1959, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAPK", "start": 2194, "end": 2197, "matched_text": "MAPK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GLUTATHIONE METABOLISM", "start": 2264, "end": 2285, "matched_text": "GLUTATHIONE METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APPLICATION", "start": 2536, "end": 2546, "matched_text": "APPLICATION", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Patients with advanced RET fusion-positive (RET+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who experience disease progression following treatment with RET inhibitors (RETis) have limited treatment options. Identifying membrane protein targets may support the assessment of novel therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies. To evaluate membrane target expression in RET+ NSCLC. This multicenter cohort study used centralized immunohistochemistry (IHC) on archival tissue samples and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) in an independent cohort. Tissue samples were collected from 12 European centers, and WTS was performed on globally sourced patient samples submitted for molecular profiling. This study included samples from patients with RET+ NSCLC and RET-wild-type (RET-wt) adenocarcinoma controls that were analyzed by IHC and 203 RET+ and 19 579 RET-wt samples analyzed by WTS. Membrane protein expression of MET, ERBB2 (formerly HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor 3 (HER3), and trophoblastic cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) was evaluated using IHC, with samples scored on a scale of 0 to 3. Scores of 2 or greater were considered positive. Target expression as analyzed by WTS was expressed as median transcript per million scores. Biomarker positivity, coexpression of biomarkers, dynamic changes in paired biopsies, and clinical correlates with survival outcomes. A total of 189 patients were included in the study (among 81 patients with RET+ NSCLC, the median [IQR] age was 62 [55-70] years, and there were 49 female individuals [60%]). In 93 samples from 81 patients with RET+ NSCLC, positive IHC scores were observed for MET in 51 of 86 (59%), ERBB2 in 3 of 84 (3.6%), EGFR in 24 of 84 (29%), HER3 in 31 of 82 (38%), and TROP2 in 59 of 65 (91%). Compared with RET-wt adenocarcinoma (n = 112), RET+ tumors showed higher MET (59% vs 43%; P = .03) and lower ERBB2 expression (3.6% vs 15%; P = .01). The WTS analysis from the independent cohort confirmed these results. Of 61 evaluable samples, 59 of 61 (97%) had at least 1 positive biomarker, 60 of 77 (78%) when excluding TROP2. MET/EGFR coexpression occurred in 17 of 79 evaluable samples (21.5%). Dynamic change in biomarker expression was observed in paired biopsy specimens. No significant survival differences based on target expression emerged in patients treated with RETi in the IHC and the WTS cohorts. The results of this cohort study suggest that RET+ NSCLC tumors frequently express MET and TROP2, with MET positivity enriched vs RET-wt controls.

{"text": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), part of the tyrosine kinase family, serves as a key therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer, particularly those with HER2 overexpression. HER2 is overexpressed or amplified in approximately 15-20% of breast cancers. It includes HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4, which progress the growth of cancerous cells. Key signaling pathways involved in HER2-driven breast cancer progression include the MAPK and mTOR pathways, which activate a cascade of factors that promote DNA synthesis and cell growth. A crucial process in HER2 cancer development is HER2 dimerization, which forms a functional oncogenic unit and is followed crucially by HER2:HER3 heterodimerization that leads to downstream signaling pathways. Alterations in the HER2 in solid tumors and ERBB2 gene mutations have led to advancements and implantation of precision-targeted approaches, as well as to combat the issues from the traditional approaches of targeting. In this review, we have thoroughly discussed different HER2-targeting therapies, which include monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, molecular probes targeting by PET/CT imaging, cancer vaccines, and cell therapies like CART-T and CAR-M cell therapy.

{"text": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term inflammatory condition impacting the bowel with an unclear cause. It is categorized as a refractory condition due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of existing treatments. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative and primary active metabolite of artemisinin, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. To assess the therapeutic effects of DHA on UC and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mouse model (2.5% DSS for 30 days) was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DHA (20 mg/kg/day) through assessment of disease activity, colon damage, and inflammation. Key targets were identified using network pharmacology, followed by pathway analysis (GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG]), molecular docking, and western blotting to validate interactions and signaling modulation. DHA treatment significantly improved disease activity index (DAI) scores, reduced colon shortening, and ameliorated histopathological injury in the DSS-induced UC mouse model. Seven core targets of DHA were identified: EGFR, MMP9, PTGS2, MMP2, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), MAPK1, and ERBB2.

Pre-existing, cross-sectional studies of adults (aged â¥18) completing the T1D or T2D Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scales (DSAS-1/DSAS-2) were collated. Descriptive statistics were calculated for (sub)scale and item scores. Variance-components linear random-effect multi-level modelling (nested random intercepts for country and study) estimated overall mean (sub)scale scores, 95% confidence intervals, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% prediction intervals. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests provided inference for country- and study-specific heterogeneity. Eleven studies were included from six countries (Australia k = 2, Canada k = 1, Japan k = 2, New Zealand k = 1, UAE k = 1, USA k = 4) in four languages (Arabic k = 1, English k = 7, Japanese k = 2, Spanish k = 1). Six studies included n = 3114 adults with T1D (insulin pump: 42%; 75% aged <60 years). Ten studies included n = 6586 adults with T2D (insulin-treated: 37%; 44% aged <60 years).

{"text": "Despite advances in pharmacological treatments, diabetes mellitus remains a significant global health challenge, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and associated metabolic dysfunctions. Effective and sustainable glycemic control remains elusive, prompting exploration into unconventional sources of metabolic insights. Social insects, in particular bees and ants, exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations enabling them to thrive on carbohydrate-rich diets without developing metabolic disorders typical in humans. This review investigates the bees and ants metabolic strategies to avoid metabolic disorders like diabetes, focusing on their enzymatic pathways such as trehalose metabolism, specialized hormonal regulation involving insulin-like peptides, adipokinetic hormones, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning their metabolic resilience. By systematically comparing these insect adaptations with human metabolic systems, the proposed study identifies potential translational applications, including engineered probiotics, gene-editing approaches, and bioactive compounds for diabetes management. Furthermore, it explores technical, ethical, and ecological considerations for translating insect-derived metabolic mechanisms into human therapies.

{"text": "The intestine plays numerous roles in the normal physiology of our body. Gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network linking the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional system integrates endocrine, neural, and immune signals, impacting host metabolism and cognition. The gut microbiota, a critical component of the GBA, significantly impacts gut hormones, neurotransmission, neural development, and other components of gut-brain-axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis facilitates communication via metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, Î³-amino butyric acid (GABA) and serotonin. The microbiota influences gut peptide production, including ghrelin, glucagon like pepetide-1 (GLP-1), serotonin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), thereby modulating nutrient absorption and immune responses. Gut hormones such as ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), serotonin (5-HT), neurotensin, peptide YY (PYY) and melatonin play key roles in the GBA. These hormones play several roles including modulation of appetite and satiety, metabolism of nutrients such as lipid and glucose, insulin and glucagon secretion, and influence on gut inflammation, mood, learning and cognition. The interaction between gut microbiota and these hormones underscores their role in maintaining gut-brain homeostasis. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, is linked to altered stress responses, anxiety, and depressive behaviors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of microbiota modulation. Despite the significant roles of gut hormones and microbiota in the GBA, literature on their cellular and molecular mechanisms is limited, and often based on animal models. This review synthesizes current understanding of hormones secreted by the intestine, their physiological effects and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action underlying these effects, with a focus on their roles in the GBA.

{"text": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are major concerns for surgical patients. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia have been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are included in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines.

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data was collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 patients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed other short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse events (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included independent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared with the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we found that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a significant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI â¥ 30. Among secondary outcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved postoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital stay.

{"text": "Despite the great advances in medicine, there is a compelling need to develop alternative strategies to effectively treat obesity with the use of plant-origin therapeutics. Cannabigerol (CBG) appears to be a novel promising compound for managing this increasingly prevalent disease requiring multifaceted pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the herein study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic properties of 2-week CBG administration on the muscular metabolism of sphingolipids as well as insulin signal transduction pathway in a rat model of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) induced by high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) were used to determine the sphingolipids content, while the multiplex assay kit was applied to measure the level of the phosphorylated form of proteins from the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The expression of various proteins engaged in the sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western blotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular content of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced the intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), redirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), respectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, inhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats.

{"text": "BACKGROUND Endoscopic surgery has become increasingly important in management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, limited research exists on postoperative hypotension in NPC patients undergoing endoscopic surgery. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the risk factors associated with postoperative hypotension in such patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included NPC patients who underwent endoscopic surgery after radiotherapy at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between 2021 and 2023. Patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg were categorized into the hypotension group. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with postoperative hypotension. RESULTS Among 264 patients, 86 (32.5%) experienced postoperative hypotension. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between postoperative hypotension and factors such as sex, height, weight, admission SBP, admission MAP, preoperative hemoglobin level, and preoperative blood calcium level. Multivariate logistic regression identified height [odds ratio (OR): 0.957; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.924-0.991], admission SBP (OR: 0.979; 95% CI: 0.963-0.995), preoperative blood calcium concentration (OR: 0.044; 95% CI: 0.003-0.734), and the use of dexmedetomidine during surgery (OR: 0.278; 95% CI: 0.091-0.848) as independent risk factors for postoperative hypotension. CONCLUSIONS Height, admission SBP, preoperative blood calcium concentration, and the use of dexmedetomidine during surgery were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative hypotension in NPC patients undergoing endoscopic surgery. Identifying and addressing these factors can help clinicians optimize perioperative management by carefully titrating dexmedetomidine doses, ensuring adequate preoperative blood pressure control, and correcting calcium imbalances to maintain hemodynamic stability.", "entities": [{"entity": "NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA", "start": 82, "end": 105, "matched_text": "NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NPC", "start": 108, "end": 110, "matched_text": "NPC", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HYPOTENSION", "start": 164, "end": 174, "matched_text": "HYPOTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPOTENSION", "start": 164, "end": 174, "matched_text": "HYPOTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOOD PRESSURE", "start": 550, "end": 563, "matched_text": "BLOOD PRESSURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SBP", "start": 566, "end": 568, "matched_text": "SBP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 607, "end": 609, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 607, "end": 609, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 976, "end": 978, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 1075, "end": 1079, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}]}

Recently, hemoglobin and anemia have received more attention as predictors of maternal obesity. No such study exists in Rwanda. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the factors associated with obesity, including hemoglobin and anemia, among pregnant women in Kigali, Rwanda. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals in Kigali, Rwanda, from June to August 2024. A questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data. Weight, height, and hemoglobin were measured using standard procedures. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed. A total of 445 pregnant women were recruited. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age and parity were 30.0 (26.0â35.0) years and 1 (0â3), respectively. Of the 445 women, 143 (32.1%), 249 (56.0%), and 53 (11.9%) were of normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. One hundred and seven (24.0%) pregnant women had anemia.

Sixteen healthy young volunteers, aged 20-28 years, participated in two randomly assigned sessions, i.e., nine testing rounds of PNF stretching and yoga postures, conducted on two consecutive days. To ensure uniformity in the sessions, each volunteer underwent a 30-day orientation of both PNF stretching and yoga postures prior to the testing rounds. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record the blood flow responses of the right and left PFC at rest, during nine practice epochs, and after practice. Repeated measures analysis of variance with 2 Ã 2 Ã 3 (Sessions Ã right and left PFC Ã States respectively) was followed up with post-hoc analysis for oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). During PNF and yoga posture, there was significantly greater bilateral HbO in the prefrontal region of the brain. The results demonstrated improved PFC HbO from pre to during session (p < 0.05) in both PNF and yoga sessions. However, there was a more rapid change in HbR during the PNF sessions compared to yoga. The results suggest that yoga practice helps to maintain better oxygenation levels and may prevent rapid deoxygenation, which can indicate less fatigue or stress on the brain. In contrast, the rapid deoxygenation seen during PNF sessions could be associated with increased muscular effort and fatigue, leading to lower oxygen retention in the prefrontal cortex.", "entities": [{"entity": "PNF", "start": 44, "end": 46, "matched_text": "PNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORTEX", "start": 234, "end": 239, "matched_text": "CORTEX", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PFC", "start": 242, "end": 244, "matched_text": "PFC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 686, "end": 690, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "REST", "start": 736, "end": 739, "matched_text": "REST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "REST", "start": 736, "end": 739, "matched_text": "REST", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 924, "end": 927, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OXYHEMOGLOBIN", "start": 946, "end": 958, "matched_text": "OXYHEMOGLOBIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEOXYHEMOGLOBIN", "start": 970, "end": 984, "matched_text": "DEOXYHEMOGLOBIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BILATERAL", "start": 1054, "end": 1062, "matched_text": "BILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 1100, "end": 1104, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HELPS", "start": 1345, "end": 1349, "matched_text": "HELPS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1450, "end": 1456, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FATIGUE", "start": 1450, "end": 1456, "matched_text": "FATIGUE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RETENTION", "start": 1632, "end": 1640, "matched_text": "RETENTION", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly performed surgical procedure for the treatment of advanced-stage knee osteoarthritis. This study aims to compare perioperative blood loss between tourniquet-assisted and tourniquet-free TKA using the reference change value (RCV), a personalized analytical tool that accounts for both biological and analytical variability. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 137 patients (tourniquet group (n = 68) and non-tourniquet group (n = 69) who underwent primary TKA. Hematological parameters-including red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), and hematocrit (HCT)-were evaluated preoperatively, on the day of surgery, and on postoperative day one. Blood loss was assessed using both conventional statistical methods and RCV-based analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age and gender (p > 0.05). Although preoperative hemoglobin levels were significantly different between groups (p < 0.05), there were no significant intergroup differences in pre- or postoperative RBC and HCT values. Traditional statistical analysis showed no significant difference in blood loss (p > 0.05). However, RCV analysis revealed that while bleeding had stabilized by the first postoperative day in the non-tourniquet group, it remained significantly elevated in the tourniquet group.

{"text": "Type 2 diabetes is a recognized risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Fenofibrate and curcumin were found to be effective in improving hyperlipidemia in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding fenofibrate versus curcumin on weight, glycemic status, lipids profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fetuin-A, and sirtuin 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with glimepiride. In a double-blind, randomized control trial, 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned into three groups: Group I was given placebo; Group II curcumin 1100 mg; Group III fenofibrate 160 mg (each administered orally once daily) to ongoing glimepiride 4 mg therapy administered orally once daily for three months. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients aged 35-70 years, those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and those treated with glimepiride 4 mg. Exclusion criteria were as follows: other types of diabetes, pregnancy, abnormal liver or kidney function tests, using other anti-diabetes medications, and non-adherence to medications. At baseline and after three months of intervention, anthropometric measurements were measured, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, hs-CRP, fetuin-A, and sirtuin 1. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for normally distributed data. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank and the Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze non-normally distributed data. Three months after the intervention, when the three groups were compared, no significant differences were found regarding weight, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, two-hour postprandial glucose (2 h-PPG), and HbA1c (p > 0.05). Compared to placebo, significant decreases were observed in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), coronary risk index (CRI), atherogenic index (AI), and hs-CRP and increasing sirtuin 1 in the fenofibrate (p < 0.001) and curcumin (p < 0.05) groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the fenofibrate group were found to be significantly higher than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to curcumin, fenofibrate significantly reduced waist circumferences and fetuin-A and increased sirtuin 1 (p < 0.05). Both fenofibrate and curcumin are effective at decreasing lipid profiles and improving inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes.

An \"unstable pattern of transaminases\" was defined as recurrent AST or ALT elevations. Unfavourable outcomes included new cirrhosis, elastography progression > 2 Kpa, liver transplant, or liver-related deaths. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact of various factors on disease outcome. Of 162 patients, 81.5% had mild disease at diagnosis. Most received chelators as first-line therapy, achieving an 81.4% one-year biochemical response. After a median follow-up of 17 years, 59% exhibited an unstable transaminase pattern, and 29% had an unfavourable outcome. Key factors associated with poor outcome included older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.03), lack of early biochemical response (OR = 0.19), advanced disease markers (platelet count, albumin), and an unstable transaminase pattern (OR = 2.92). Transaminase levels did not predict outcomes based on initial disease severity. Even patients with mild disease at diagnosis and persistently normal transaminases could experience progression over time, underscoring the need for more thorough follow-up evaluations.

{"text": "The transplacental transfer of xenobiotics, particularly in an enantioselective manner, is a critical and evolving area of developmental toxicology. Pregnant women, as a highly vulnerable population, are frequently exposed to pervasive chiral chemicals that can cross the placenta, with the placenta serving as an enantioselective barrier. Despite significant research on enantioselective transfer of xenobiotics using various models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro), a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of xenobiotics-plasma protein binding remains lacking. This review provides a state-of-the-art synthesis of the characteristics and mechanisms governing the enantioselective transplacental transfer of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial additives-representative chiral xenobiotics of significant public health concern. We highlight how xenobiotics, acting as ligands, interact with proteins, influencing enantioselective transfer through key processes such as plasma protein binding, transporter-mediated biotransport, and enzyme-catalyzed biotransformation. Notably, the binding of xenobiotics to human serum albumin (HSA) rather than Î±1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is shown to primarily inhibit the transmembrane transport of small molecules. Whereas limited docking studies suggest Sudlow site II as a pivotal site for enantioselective binding. Additionally, P-glycoprotein (permeability glycoprotein, P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) are important in determining the enantiomeric distribution between maternal and fetus. Pathological conditions may also modify transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs). Future research employing advanced techniques, such as isotopic tracing, affinity chromatography, high-resolution screening, and machine learning, will be essential to further elucidate enantiomeric transport mechanisms and their implications for fetal development.", "entities": [{"entity": "PLACENTA", "start": 273, "end": 280, "matched_text": "PLACENTA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PLASMA PROTEIN", "start": 543, "end": 556, "matched_text": "PLASMA PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN BINDING", "start": 550, "end": 564, "matched_text": "PROTEIN BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ART", "start": 619, "end": 621, "matched_text": "ART", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SYNTHESIS", "start": 623, "end": 631, "matched_text": "SYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 868, "end": 870, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 974, "end": 976, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 1108, "end": 1114, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SERUM ALBUMIN", "start": 1140, "end": 1152, "matched_text": "SERUM ALBUMIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HSA", "start": 1155, "end": 1157, "matched_text": "HSA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GLYCOPROTEIN", "start": 1181, "end": 1192, "matched_text": "GLYCOPROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AGP", "start": 1195, "end": 1197, "matched_text": "AGP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSMEMBRANE TRANSPORT", "start": 1234, "end": 1256, "matched_text": "TRANSMEMBRANE TRANSPORT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "P-GLYCOPROTEIN", "start": 1395, "end": 1408, "matched_text": "P-GLYCOPROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYTOCHROME P450", "start": 1448, "end": 1462, "matched_text": "CYTOCHROME P450", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LEARNING", "start": 1782, "end": 1789, "matched_text": "LEARNING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSPORT", "start": 1844, "end": 1852, "matched_text": "TRANSPORT", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Due to the rarity of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC), limited literature exists regarding the therapeutic benefit of plasmapheresis, particularly in the context of severe hyperbilirubinemia. A 25-year-old female presented with jaundice and severe pruritus. Laboratory findings revealed a total bilirubin of 37 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin of 27 mg/dL. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 31 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 35 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 175 U/L. The patient had a five-year history of recurrent episodes, previously resolving spontaneously or with medical treatment. Following liver biopsy diagnosis and failure of conventional therapy, she underwent plasmapheresis on alternate days. Four sessions of one plasma volume exchange, using albumin, were performed concurrently with medical treatment. The patient demonstrated rapid and significant improvement in pruritus and urine color, with no adverse events or need for fresh frozen plasma.

We utilized data from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), incorporating both cross-sectional and cohort study designs. The association between the serum Klotho and DKD was examined using weighted logistic regression models. To estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality, weighted Ãox proportional hazards models were applied. Restricted cubic spline analysis was used to assess the linear or nonlinear relationships between the serum Klotho and DKD or all-cause mortality. Additionally, mediation analysis was conducted to determine whether the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) mediated the effect of serum Klotho on all-cause mortality. Our findings revealed a significant reverse association between serum Klotho and DKD after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in Model 2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90, P = 0.01). However, this association was attenuated and lost statistical significance after further adjustment for comorbidities, SII, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio in Model 3 (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.32-1.31, P = 0.2). During an average follow-up period of 76 months, a total of 795 individuals (34%) experienced mortality. Weighted multivariate Cox regression models indicated that each one-unit increase in the serum Klotho was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.82, P = 0.008) in DKD patients. Furthermore, restricted cubic spline analysis identified a nonlinear relationship between the serum Klotho and DKD (P for nonlinearity < 0.001), while a linear relationship was observed between serum Klotho and all-cause mortality (P for nonlinearity = 0.3480) among DKD populations. Stratified and interaction analysis confirmed the robustness of these core findings.

Multivariable generalized linear regression and restricted cubic spline models were used to examine the relationships between clinical parameters and sertraline concentrations. The daily dose and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level were positively correlated with the sertraline concentration in both age groups. Sex had a significant effect, with women exhibiting 43% (P = 0.001) and 37% (P = 0.001) higher concentrations than men in the child/adolescent and adult groups, respectively. In children and adolescents, the albumin (Alb) level and neutrophil (NEUT) count also considerably influence concentrations. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) tended to be present at relatively high concentrations, but the difference was not statistically significant. Among child and adolescent patients, significant differences in dose-adjusted serum concentration (C/D) values (P = 0.0291) were observed across different CYP2C19 phenotypes, with PMs exhibiting higher C/D values.

Aging, a significant cardiovascular risk factor, is linked to increased collagen deposition, left ventricular remodelling, and fibrosis. Similarly, sex differences affect cardiovascular disease progression, with notable variations in the deposition of collagen types I and III between males and females. While collagen accumulation is present in aging in both sexes, females exhibit a tempered response until menopause, primarily due to oestrogen-mediated suppression of excessive collagen remodelling. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying age- and sex-related changes in cardiac collagen metabolism and their implications for myocardial health. Aging-associated fibrosis and collagen accumulation appear mechanistically distinct from those seen with injury or dysfunction, occurring without increased collagen synthesis despite elevated degradation enzymes. Factors such as senescence, inflammation, oxidative stress, and enhanced ECM crosslinking are identified as key drivers of these metabolic shifts. While studies in ovariectomized rodent models have highlighted the role of sex in collagen metabolism, evidence suggests that aging exerts a more dominant influence overall. Additionally, this review emphasizes a critical gap in the field: the limited availability of longitudinal aging fibrosis studies that include both sexes. This scarcity hampers a comprehensive understanding of how aging and sex collectively shape collagen turnover and myocardial health. By assessing these knowledge gaps, the review aims to define current perspectives and may provide insights to help inform the development of more effective, targeted therapeutic approaches.", "entities": [{"entity": "SEX", "start": 9, "end": 11, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROFOUND", "start": 19, "end": 26, "matched_text": "PROFOUND", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 46, "end": 50, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 108, "end": 114, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX", "start": 187, "end": 206, "matched_text": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ECM", "start": 209, "end": 211, "matched_text": "ECM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "COLLAGEN", "start": 228, "end": 235, "matched_text": "COLLAGEN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 305, "end": 311, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 305, "end": 311, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 322, "end": 327, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "start": 560, "end": 581, "matched_text": "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MENOPAUSE", "start": 798, "end": 806, "matched_text": "MENOPAUSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "COLLAGEN METABOLISM", "start": 981, "end": 999, "matched_text": "COLLAGEN METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "COLLAGEN SYNTHESIS", "start": 1203, "end": 1220, "matched_text": "COLLAGEN SYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 1239, "end": 1249, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SENESCENCE", "start": 1276, "end": 1285, "matched_text": "SENESCENCE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1288, "end": 1299, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1288, "end": 1299, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1302, "end": 1317, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 1368, "end": 1370, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1474, "end": 1477, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 1510, "end": 1517, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GAP", "start": 1629, "end": 1631, "matched_text": "GAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 1791, "end": 1793, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 1915, "end": 1918, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}]}

IRB approval was obtained to collect otherwise-discarded tissues from patients undergoing surgical management of labral tears and FAI. The collected tissue was exposed to collagenase type II for 16-24 h for chondrocyte isolation. Isolated cells were counted and seeded onto T-25 flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Media was changed every three days until > 90% confluency. At confluency, cells were counted and seeded onto a T-175 flask representing passage one. At second confluency, cells were counted again; if the total did not surpass 20,000,000 cells based on the minimum number needed for cell-based treatments, they were seeded onto two T-175 flasks representing passage two. Cells were not expanded beyond passage two based on the goal of phenotype maintenance. Mean weight of collected tissues was 209.69 Â± 78.09 mg (median = 202 mg). 41 of 55 samples reached > 20,000,000 cells at a mean of 33.98 Â± 13.06 days (median = 30 days).

Seventy-five male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, TSCI, hydrogel, microspheres, and hydrogel loaded with microspheres (Hyd + Micro). Tissue samples were collected from the injury site for further evaluation. Compared to the TSCI group, treatment groups demonstrated notably higher numerical densities of neurons and greater motor neuron health, as well as increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and antioxidative factors (catalase [CAT], glutathione [GSH], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]), and improved neurological function scores (electromyography [EMG], Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) test, and narrow beam-walking test [NBT]). These changes were most pronounced in the Hyd + Micro group. The treatment also led to a significant decrease in the counts of apoptotic and glial cells, alongside reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±), with the most notable enhancements seen in the Hyd + Micro group.

{"text": "Ischemic stroke (IS) is a life-threatening condition in humans with high morbidity and mortality rates in developing and industrialized countries. The occlusion of blood-supporting vessels by thrombus or emboli can contribute to massive brain cell damage, neurological deficits, and long-term disability, and in more severe conditions, results in sudden death. Current therapeutic strategies, along with rehabilitation, in part, but not completely, can restore the integrity and function of the brain. These features necessitate the advent of novel therapeutic protocols for yielding better regenerative outcomes in IS patients. In past decades, the discovery of stem cells and byproducts has led to promising results in in vitro settings and pre-clinical studies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles released from various cell types, for instance, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with certain signaling biomolecules, growth factors, and cytokines involved in cell-to-cell communication. A great plethora of studies have pointed to the fact that EVs with specific cargo can distribute easily in different parts of the body, making them appropriate therapeutics under different pathological conditions. The current review articles aimed to highlight the neuroangiogenesis properties of MSC EVs in IS conditions. How and by which mechanisms MSC EVs can orchestrate the process of nervous system regeneration is at the center of debate.

{"text": "COVID-19 is a complex disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of the disease are unclear and their study is one of the greatest challenges for the modern science. Since the lung is the biggest target for SARS-CoV-2, the studies on cellular and molecular changes in this organ are essential to establish the pathogenesis of the disease. To date there is increasing number of reports on the lung pathology of fatal COVID-19 and the results are mainly obtained by autopsies of elderly patients, since this age group shows highest mortality. Little is known about the progression of the disease in children and especially newborn and infants and, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the lung features of fatal COVID-19 in this age group. In the present case study, we have investigated the lung morphological features in 11-months old infant who has died as a result of complications from COVID-19. Immunohistochemistry for immune cell markers and transmission electron microscopy for alveolocytes type II (ATII) are made. Immediate cause of the death was acute respiratory failure resulting from bilateral interstitial pneumonia and subsequent acute cardiovascular failure. The histopathology shows lung edema, hyaline membranes, airway mucus plugging and interstitial inflammation. On cellular level we have observed a substantial increase in the number of ATII cells. ATII cells were marked with cytokeratin 19, TTF1 and napsin A. Transmission elec-tron microscopy reveals ongoing apoptosis in these cells with a typical chromatin clustering and condensation towards the inner nuclear membrane. Immunohisto-chemistry shows significant increase of CD68+ macro-phages in the alveoli, increase of IL-6 in immune and stromal cells, moderate elevation of FOXP3+ and IL-17+ cells and expression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in alveolar walls. Immune cell interactions are discussed in the sense of ongoing cytokine storm. Our findings highlight the complexity of COVID-19 lung affection, involving ATII cell hyperplasia, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and macrophages increase. The findings provide an additional knowledge on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the lung and can serve as a basis for investigation of molecular mechanisms of this disease.", "entities": [{"entity": "COVID-19", "start": 1, "end": 8, "matched_text": "COVID-19", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "COMPLEX DISEASE", "start": 15, "end": 29, "matched_text": "COMPLEX DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SARS-COV-2", "start": 41, "end": 50, "matched_text": "SARS-COV-2", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 98, "end": 104, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 202, "end": 205, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ORGAN", "start": 299, "end": 303, "matched_text": "ORGAN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 336, "end": 347, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 962, "end": 965, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 962, "end": 965, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE", "start": 1087, "end": 1111, "matched_text": "ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BILATERAL", "start": 1128, "end": 1136, "matched_text": "BILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PNEUMONIA", "start": 1151, "end": 1159, "matched_text": "PNEUMONIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PNEUMONIA", "start": 1151, "end": 1159, "matched_text": "PNEUMONIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LUNG EDEMA", "start": 1231, "end": 1240, "matched_text": "LUNG EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYALINE MEMBRANES", "start": 1243, "end": 1259, "matched_text": "HYALINE MEMBRANES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MUCUS", "start": 1269, "end": 1273, "matched_text": "MUCUS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1301, "end": 1312, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1301, "end": 1312, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TTF1", "start": 1446, "end": 1449, "matched_text": "TTF1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1515, "end": 1523, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 1555, "end": 1563, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INNER NUCLEAR MEMBRANE", "start": 1605, "end": 1626, "matched_text": "INNER NUCLEAR MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CD68", "start": 1681, "end": 1684, "matched_text": "CD68", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-6", "start": 1728, "end": 1731, "matched_text": "IL-6", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-6", "start": 1728, "end": 1731, "matched_text": "IL-6", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MODERATE", "start": 1762, "end": 1769, "matched_text": "MODERATE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FOXP3", "start": 1784, "end": 1788, "matched_text": "FOXP3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-17", "start": 1795, "end": 1799, "matched_text": "IL-17", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-17", "start": 1795, "end": 1799, "matched_text": "IL-17", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CD4", "start": 1826, "end": 1828, "matched_text": "CD4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CYTOKINE STORM", "start": 1928, "end": 1941, "matched_text": "CYTOKINE STORM", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MONONUCLEAR CELL", "start": 2056, "end": 2071, "matched_text": "MONONUCLEAR CELL", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM) is a prevalent complication arising from radiation therapy for tumors or combined radiotherapy, but the therapeutic options available remain limited. Understanding its underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing effective interventions. To investigate whether keratinocyte necroptosis contributes to RIOM pathogenesis and evaluate the effects of RIPK3/MLKL inhibition. A mouse model of RIOM was established with varying irradiation doses. Tongue tissues were analyzed via histological staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. In vitro, keratinocytes were irradiated and treated with RIPK3 or MLKL inhibitors. Subsequently, cell viability, necroptosis, and inflammatory cytokine expression were assessed using CCK-8, LDH release, Western blot, flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. In irradiated mouse tongues, p-RIPK3/RIPK3 and p-MLKL/MLKL ratios were significantly elevated (P < 0.01), accompanied by heightened expression levels of IL-1Î² and IL-6. Similar findings were observed in keratinocytes, which, after 12 Gy irradiation for 2.5 days, reduced cell viability (P < 0.001), enhanced necroptotic marker expression (P < 0.001), and increased inflammatory cytokine levels (P < 0.001). Furthermore, treatment with RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 or MLKL inhibitor GW806742X significantly reduced irradiation-induced keratinocyte cell death (P < 0.001), LDH release (P < 0.001) and the expression of inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.01).

A total of 128 children 3-14 years of age with MPP who underwent bronchoscopy at Jingmen Central Hospital, China, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 were enrolled. Patients were divided into a PB and a non-PB group based on bronchoscopy findings. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, including BALF cytokine levels, were compared. A risk prediction nomogram for PB was constructed and evaluated. Of 128 children with MPP, 40 (31%) had PB. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that clinically severe MPP (OR = 8.78; P = 0.002), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (OR = 2.78; P = 0.049) and elevated BALF interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR = 1.01; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for PB. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value for the combination of severe MPP, SIRS and IL-6 was 0.852 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.93). A calibration curve showed good agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observations (P = 0.723). A decision curve analysis indicated that the nomogram demonstrated good clinical applicability. Pronounced inflammatory responses and increased clinical severity of MPP are associated with PB.

{"text": "A high fat diet (HFD) leads to lesions of the gastric epithelium and causes a proinflammatory environment. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone hormone, regulates renal phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. Under pathophysiological conditions production of FGF23 is stimulated. HFD feeding elevates serum FGF23 levels through inflammation. We aimed to investigate whether HFD feeding and obesity is associated with gastric FGF23 production. Mice were fed a standard diet or HFD for 12 weeks (long-term) or 1 week (short-term), and the stomachs were then examined. Additionally, corpus specimens from patients with obesity, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and normal human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1) were studied. FGF23 production was examined by qPCR and Western blotting, mucosal integrity assessed by fluorescence microscopy, and FGF23-expressing cells analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In mice, HFD feeding up-regulated Fgf23 expression and FGF23 protein abundance in the proximal glandular stomach. FGF23-positive cells were detected in damaged glandular and interglandular areas representing mucus-like cells, endothelial cells of interconnected blood vessels or stromal endothelial cells and myofibroblasts. FGF23 expression was associated with impaired tissue integrity, immune cell infiltration and lipid deposition, with less pronounced mucosal changes upon short-term HFD feeding. Gastric FGF23 was also detectable in patients with obesity, mainly in endothelial cells of dilated and interconnected vessels. In HUVECs, pro-angiogenic adipokine leptin ramped up FGF23 transcript levels. In GES-1 cells, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) tended to enhance FGF23 expression. HFD feeding stimulates gastric FGF23 production and, in particular, increases the number of FGF23-expressing endothelial and epithelial cells.", "entities": [{"entity": "FAT", "start": 8, "end": 10, "matched_text": "FAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIUM", "start": 55, "end": 64, "matched_text": "EPITHELIUM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 23", "start": 108, "end": 134, "matched_text": "FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 23", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FGF23", "start": 137, "end": 141, "matched_text": "FGF23", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VITAMIN D METABOLISM", "start": 191, "end": 210, "matched_text": "VITAMIN D METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 332, "end": 343, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 332, "end": 343, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 394, "end": 400, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 394, "end": 400, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 447, "end": 450, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 503, "end": 506, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VEIN", "start": 645, "end": 648, "matched_text": "VEIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GES-1", "start": 721, "end": 725, "matched_text": "GES-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 979, "end": 985, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 979, "end": 985, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROXIMAL", "start": 1004, "end": 1011, "matched_text": "PROXIMAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "STOMACH", "start": 1023, "end": 1029, "matched_text": "STOMACH", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MUCUS", "start": 1126, "end": 1130, "matched_text": "MUCUS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 1180, "end": 1184, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 1289, "end": 1294, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1314, "end": 1317, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1314, "end": 1317, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LIPID", "start": 1336, "end": 1340, "matched_text": "LIPID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LEPTIN", "start": 1583, "end": 1588, "matched_text": "LEPTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INTERLEUKIN-1", "start": 1666, "end": 1678, "matched_text": "INTERLEUKIN-1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IL-1", "start": 1683, "end": 1686, "matched_text": "IL-1", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) demonstrate therapeutic potential against psoriasis, primarily due to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, the specific components within the exosomal cargo, particularly microRNAs, that mediate this activity remain unclear. This study investigated the role of a specific microRNA in mediating the therapeutic effects of exosomes from human placenta MSCs (MSC-exosomes) in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis murine model, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms, particularly the downstream pathways of the specific microRNA. Our small RNA sequencing analysis identified microRNA (miR)-100-5p as a potential target. Adult male Balb/c mice were then randomly assigned to the IMQ, IMQ plus MSC-exosomes (IMQ + Exo), IMQ plus MSC-exosomes treated with a specific miR-100-5p inhibitor (IMQ + Exoi), or IMQ plus agomiR-100-5p group (IMQ + AgomiR) (n = 6 per group). Control groups were also included. Mice were sacrificed, and psoriasis severity was assessed the day after 6 consecutive days of daily IMQ exposure, followed by 7 consecutive days of daily treatment. The IMQ + Exo group exhibited significantly lower epidermal thickness, levels of inflammatory cytokines and psoriasis-related cytokines (interleukin [IL]-12, IL-17, and IL-23), and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (the predicted downstream target of miR-100-5p), compared to the IMQ group (all p < 0.05). Notably, inhibition of miR-100-5p nullified these therapeutic effects of MSC-exosomes. This study provides evidence that miR-100-5p plays a crucial role in mediating the therapeutic effects of MSC-exosomes in an IMQ-induced murine psoriasis model, potentially by modulating the mTOR/S6K1 pathway.

{"text": "Most patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency medical services (EMS) setting are suspected of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Distinguishing true NSTE-ACS from non-cardiac chest pain based solely on the ECG is challenging. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for risk stratification of suspected NSTE-ACS patients and to compare its performance with currently available prehospital diagnostic tools. For this study, an internal training cohort and an external validation cohort were used, both consisting of suspected NSTE-ACS patients. A CNN (ECG interpretation by CNN (ECG-AI)) was trained and validated to detect NSTE-ACS. The diagnostic value of ECG-AI in detecting NSTE-ACS was compared with on-site ECG analyses by an EMS paramedic (ECG-EMS), point-of-care troponin assessment and a validated prehospital clinical risk score (prehospital History, ECG, Age, Risk factors and POC-troponin (preHEART)). A total of 5645 patients suspected of NSTE-ACS were included. In the external validation cohort (n=754), 27% were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS. ECG-AI had a better diagnostic performance than ECG-EMS (area under the curve (AUROC) 0.70 (0.66 to 0.74) vs AUROC 0.65 (0.61 to 0.70), p=0.045) for diagnosing NSTE-ACS. The overall diagnostic accuracy of preHEART was AUROC 0.78 (0.74 to 0.82) and superior compared with ECG-AI (p=0.001). Incorporating ECG-AI into preHEART led to a significant improvement in diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.83 (0.79 to 0.86), p<0.001). Correctly identifying patients who are at low risk for having NSTE-ACS is crucial for optimal triage in the prehospital setting. Recent studies have shown that these low-risk patients could potentially be left at home or transferred to a general practitioner, leading to less emergency department overcrowding and lower healthcare costs. Other studies demonstrated better overall diagnostic performance compared with our artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, these studies were aimed at a study population with a high prevalence of occlusive myocardial infarction, which could explain the differing levels of diagnostic performance. Integrating AI in prehospital ECG interpretation improves the identification of patients at low risk for having NSTE-ACS. Nonetheless, clinical risk scores currently yield the best diagnostic performance and their accuracy could be further enhanced through AI.

Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has emerged as a promising technique for calcium modification in high-risk coronary interventions. We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stage 4 chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented with anterior acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography revealed heavily calcified LM disease with triple vessel involvement. The cardiothoracic surgery team assessed her as high risk for surgical revascularization due to her advanced age and multiple comorbidities. Echocardiography showed regional wall motion abnormalities with moderately reduced ejection fraction (40%), and high-sensitivity troponin I was markedly elevated (>24,000 ng/L). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. Shockwave IVL was used to prepare the calcified LM lesion, followed by successful stenting with restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) III flow.

{"text": "Cardiac Purkinje fibers (PFs) orchestrate myocardial synchrony, but in regions of myocardial scarring, drive ventricular arrhythmia. It is hypothesized that arrhythmias refractory to ablation may be driven by PFs deep in the scarred myocardium. However, knowledge of human PF anatomy remains reliant on data generated in animal models, obscuring understanding of the substrate underpinning dysrhythmia and pacing strategies. This study sought to establish and utilize a human biomarker to delineate PF anatomy in humans. RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis of transcriptomes from human hearts (N = 10) revealed 99 genes up-regulated in PFs vs ventricular myocardium and endocardium. Whole-mount megablock cross-sectional analysis was performed with cardiac troponin, MYL4, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's Trichrome, pro-ANP, and GJA5 colocalization. Comparative transcriptomics from human hearts (N = 10) identified myosin light chain 4 (MYL4) as a promising human PF marker for distinguishing conductive from contractile myocardium. Using PF-rich bundle branch and subendocardial regions, MYL4 specificity was validated using canonical PF markers in human (n = 3), dog (n = 3), goat (n = 3), and pig (n = 3) hearts. Cross-sectional histology of the entire human ventricular myocardium uncovered a deep-seated network of transmurally intercalated, MYL4-positive PFs. This previously unrecognized distribution of the cardiac conduction system accounted for over 60% of human myocardial PF content. Such significant intramural prevalence exposes limitations associated with treatment approaches based on dogma that PF anatomy is restricted to the subendocardium. MYL4 here enabled a comprehensive visualization of human cardiac conduction system, offering an intricate bioanatomical map for heart rhythm management.", "entities": [{"entity": "PFS", "start": 26, "end": 28, "matched_text": "PFS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SCARRING", "start": 94, "end": 101, "matched_text": "SCARRING", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SCARRING", "start": 94, "end": 101, "matched_text": "SCARRING", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA", "start": 110, "end": 131, "matched_text": "VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ARRHYTHMIAS", "start": 158, "end": 168, "matched_text": "ARRHYTHMIAS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "REFRACTORY", "start": 170, "end": 179, "matched_text": "REFRACTORY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDIUM", "start": 234, "end": 243, "matched_text": "MYOCARDIUM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ANATOMY", "start": 277, "end": 283, "matched_text": "ANATOMY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DYSRHYTHMIA", "start": 391, "end": 401, "matched_text": "DYSRHYTHMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 522, "end": 524, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 522, "end": 524, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ENDOCARDIUM", "start": 687, "end": 697, "matched_text": "ENDOCARDIUM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYL4", "start": 784, "end": 787, "matched_text": "MYL4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PERIODIC", "start": 790, "end": 797, "matched_text": "PERIODIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ANP", "start": 836, "end": 838, "matched_text": "ANP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GJA5", "start": 845, "end": 848, "matched_text": "GJA5", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RICH", "start": 1059, "end": 1062, "matched_text": "RICH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GOAT", "start": 1195, "end": 1198, "matched_text": "GOAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CARDIAC CONDUCTION", "start": 1432, "end": 1449, "matched_text": "CARDIAC CONDUCTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 1797, "end": 1799, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAP", "start": 1797, "end": 1799, "matched_text": "MAP", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 1805, "end": 1809, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RHYTHM", "start": 1811, "end": 1816, "matched_text": "RHYTHM", "type": "gene"}]}

We have previously demonstrated its ability to promote cardiac repair in small and large animals when delivered to the heart via a viral vector. However, the effect of CCNA2 gene delivery on cytokinesis in isolated cardiomyocytes from adult human hearts has not been explored. We designed a human gene therapy vector featuring a replication-deficient adenovirus encoding human CCNA2 driven by the cardiac Troponin T promoter to enable the expression of CCNA2 in freshly isolated human cardiomyocytes. Time-lapse live imaging of adult human primary cardiomyocytes from a 21-year-old male, a 41-year-old female, and a 55-year-old male demonstrated the induction of complete cytokinesis in human adult cardiomyocytes with preservation of sarcomere integrity in the resulting daughter cells with active calcium mobilization in redifferentiated cardiomyocytes. To elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this response, we conducted single-nucleus transcriptomics analysis of hearts isolated from adult transgenic mice that constitutively express CCNA2 in cardiomyocytes (CCNA2-Tg) and non- transgenic mice (nTg). This revealed a cardiomyocyte subpopulation enriched with cytokinesis, proliferative, and reprogramming genes in hearts obtained from CCNA2-Tg mice as compared to41nTg mice.

{"text": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the principal non-invasive imaging modality used to diagnose idiopathic/viral myocarditis. The revised Lake Louise criteria (LLC) stipulate that a diagnosis can be made in the presence of one T1-based and one T2-based criterion. While the LLC have been extensively validated in viral myocarditis, their utility for the diagnosis of myocarditis due to an active autoimmune rheumatic disease is unknown. This study sought to assess the performance of the revised LLC in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis due to active systemic autoimmune disease. Patients with clinically active autoimmune rheumatic disease, symptoms of myocarditis, and elevated troponin levels were recruited and compared with controls with autoimmune rheumatic disease but no suspicion of autoimmune myocarditis. All patients underwent CMR at 1.5T including T1 and T2 mapping. Thirty-seven patients with suspected myocarditis due to an active autoimmune rheumatic disease were recruited with a median (interquartile [IQR]) troponin level of 121ng/L (72-318ng/L). Overall, 24 (65%) patients met either of the two revised LLC resulting in a sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of 65% (49-78%) and specificity of 76% (57-89%). Only 12 (32%) patients fulfilled both of the main LLC (i.e., non-ischemic myocardial injury/edema with elevated T1 values or presence of late gadolinium enhancement and myocardial edema detected by increased T2 values or positive T2-STIR), resulting in a sensitivity of 32% (20-49%) and specificity of 100% (87-100%). Among controls, 6 (24%) patients had elevated native T1 values, but all had normal T2. In patients with suspected myocarditis due to autoimmune rheumatic disease, who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the Lake Louise Criteria have a high specificity, but a lower sensitivity than in patients with viral myocarditis. Additional tests should therefore be used to improve disease detection in this population. Where the pre-test probability is high, in patients with suspected myocarditis due to autoimmune rheumatic disease who are undergoing immunosuppression, there may need to be greater reliance on one T1-based criterion rather than both LLC, with the recognition that there is an appreciable rate of raised T1 in controls without myocarditis.", "entities": [{"entity": "CMR", "start": 36, "end": 38, "matched_text": "CMR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDITIS", "start": 122, "end": 132, "matched_text": "MYOCARDITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MYOCARDITIS", "start": 122, "end": 132, "matched_text": "MYOCARDITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LLC", "start": 169, "end": 171, "matched_text": "LLC", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RHEUMATIC DISEASE", "start": 416, "end": 432, "matched_text": "RHEUMATIC DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE", "start": 582, "end": 599, "matched_text": "AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE", "start": 582, "end": 599, "matched_text": "AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AUTOIMMUNE MYOCARDITIS", "start": 814, "end": 835, "matched_text": "AUTOIMMUNE MYOCARDITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MET", "start": 1115, "end": 1117, "matched_text": "MET", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 1296, "end": 1299, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EDEMA", "start": 1343, "end": 1347, "matched_text": "EDEMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "EDEMA", "start": 1343, "end": 1347, "matched_text": "EDEMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LATE", "start": 1388, "end": 1391, "matched_text": "LATE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 1945, "end": 1951, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}]}

This review explores how IR promotes amyloidogenesis by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis and enhancing Amyloid beta (AÎ²) production and aggregation. Specifically, we examine the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in cholesterol homeostasis along with their impact on insulin signaling pathways, highlights how their dysregulation can lead to IR, a significant contributor to the development of amyloidogenesis, a key factor in causing NDDs. We explore the novel molecular mechanisms linking IR and AÎ² aggregation, focusing on the interplay between ABC transporters and Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Furthermore, we also explore emerging evidence linking ABC transporters to oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction critical factors in the development of amyloidogenesis. Additionally, this review also discusses potential therapeutic strategies targeting ABC transporters to mitigate IR and reduce amyloid burden by various mechanisms including Insulin receptors/IRS-1 signaling, Phosphatidylinositol3kinase-Protein kinase-B (PI3K/AKT), Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE), Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), Glucose transporters (GLUTs), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), Adiponectin, Mitochondrial dysfunctioning, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) Wingless-related integration site/beta-catenin (Wnt/Î²-catenin) and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1).

We evaluated blood-based biomarkers for neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology, clinical features, and MRI biomarkers in former professional boxers compared to patients with AD or patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Nine former boxers were compared to age-matched patients (without single TBI or RHI) with biomarker confirmed AD (N = 15) or SCD (N = 14). Plasma samples were analyzed for amyloid beta (AÎ²)42, AÎ²42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, p-tau217, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) concentrations. Brain MRI images were processed through Freesurfer to compute disease-related regions-of-interest (ROIs) for AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Cognitive performance was assessed in memory and executive functioning (EF) domains. Five boxers had follow-up measurements after ~ 7 years. Former boxers had higher plasma GFAP, p-tau181 and p-tau217 than patients with SCD, lower volumes in all pre-specified disease-related brain regions. No differences on neuropsychological test scores between boxers and those with SCD were observed. Longitudinal analysis in the boxer group demonstrated elevation of plasma NfL and p-tau181 over time.

{"text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a diverse neurodegenerative disorder that is defined by impairments in cognitive function. This study seeks to examine the apoptotic function of long non-coding RNA linc00968 in amyloid beta 25-35 neurotoxic SH-SY5Y cells. Fragments of AÎ²25-35 were administered to SH-SY5Y cells in order to simulate the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT test. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the expression levels of linc00968 were examined in treated and untreated (control) cells exposed to AÎ²25-35. Subsequently, linc00968 was transfected with siRNA into AÎ²25-35-treated SH-SY5Y cells to silence its expression and confirmed by qRT-PCR. The impact of BCL-2, BAX, CYT-C, and the internal control gene GAPDH on apoptotic pathways was examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To assess the post-transcriptional effects, the levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-c, and Beta-actin were analyzed using western blotting. The expression of Linc00968 was observed to be elevated in AÎ² 25-35 stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. AÎ²25-35-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells led to a reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2, while the expressions of the pro-apoptotic genes BAX and CYT-C were found to be elevated. Suppression of linc00968 was observed to reverse apoptosis in AÎ²25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cells. At the protein level, silencing linc00968 with siRNA resulted in elevated levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Cyt-c. Our results show that AÎ²25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cells exhibit elevated expression of linc00968. By controlling several apoptosis-related indicators, we proposed that inhibition of linc00968 can shield AÎ²25-35 produced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.", "entities": [{"entity": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 19, "matched_text": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 190, "end": 192, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 190, "end": 192, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 215, "end": 218, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NEUROTOXICITY", "start": 334, "end": 346, "matched_text": "NEUROTOXICITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 385, "end": 388, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 385, "end": 388, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BCL-2", "start": 753, "end": 757, "matched_text": "BCL-2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BCL-2", "start": 753, "end": 757, "matched_text": "BCL-2", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BAX", "start": 760, "end": 762, "matched_text": "BAX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 797, "end": 800, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 797, "end": 800, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GAPDH", "start": 802, "end": 806, "matched_text": "GAPDH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 923, "end": 926, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BETA-ACTIN", "start": 990, "end": 999, "matched_text": "BETA-ACTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1388, "end": 1396, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1440, "end": 1446, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1440, "end": 1446, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}]}

{"text": "Serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels increase during aging and age-associated disorders. We previously showed that tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS/YARS1) is reduced in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains, and tyrosine and phenylalanine decrease TyrRS in neurons. Here, we found that tau is a negative regulator, whereas estrogen and leucine act as positive regulators of TyrRS. Young female mice exhibit increased TyrRS in the cortex compared to male mice. Notably, young Tau knockout male, but not female mice showed increased cortical TyrRS. Tau accumulation in middle-aged female mice did not decrease cortical TyrRS compared to males, suggesting that middle-aged females are resilient to tau-mediated TyrRS depletion. Tyrosine and phenylalanine treatment decreased tubulin tyrosination, activated DNA repair pathways, and protected against etoposide (ETO) and camptothecin (CPT)-induced toxicity, respectively, in neurons. While tyrosine facilitated topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) recruitment to chromatin and inhibited global transcription, in contrast, phenylalanine recruited topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2Î²) to chromatin and stimulated global transcription. Furthermore, tyrosine decreased the presence of DNA fragments in a comet assay whereas phenylalanine increased them. Addition of cis-resveratrol (cis-RSV) protected against tyrosine-induced transcription inhibition by facilitating the recruitment of both TOP1 and TOP2Î² to chromatin and increasing tubulin tyrosination. Moreover, cis-RSV decreased both total and phosphorylated tau and protected neurons against amyloid beta (AÎ²)-induced neurite degeneration and DNA damage. Gene expression profiling using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons demonstrated that cis-RSV is a broad-spectrum neuroprotective and anti-viral agent. In contrast, trans-RSV mimics phenylalanine-induced gene expression, including downregulation of long genes and induction of an AD-like gene expression signature. This work suggests that age and disease-associated increases in serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels would activate neuronal DNA repair while inhibiting transcription and tubulin tyrosination. cis-RSV protects against their toxicity by restoring tubulin tyrosination, TOP1 and TOP2Î²-mediated transcription, and decreasing tau in primary neurons.", "entities": [{"entity": "TYROSYL-TRNA SYNTHETASE", "start": 119, "end": 141, "matched_text": "TYROSYL-TRNA SYNTHETASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "YARS1", "start": 150, "end": 154, "matched_text": "YARS1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "start": 171, "end": 189, "matched_text": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TAU", "start": 282, "end": 284, "matched_text": "TAU", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ACT", "start": 340, "end": 342, "matched_text": "ACT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 390, "end": 393, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CORTEX", "start": 426, "end": 431, "matched_text": "CORTEX", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 587, "end": 589, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TUBULIN", "start": 768, "end": 774, "matched_text": "TUBULIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DNA REPAIR", "start": 800, "end": 809, "matched_text": "DNA REPAIR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ETO", "start": 854, "end": 856, "matched_text": "ETO", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CPT", "start": 877, "end": 879, "matched_text": "CPT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TOPOISOMERASE", "start": 953, "end": 965, "matched_text": "TOPOISOMERASE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TOP1", "start": 970, "end": 973, "matched_text": "TOP1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 991, "end": 999, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1022, "end": 1034, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 1090, "end": 1093, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TOP2", "start": 1096, "end": 1099, "matched_text": "TOP2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 1202, "end": 1204, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RSV", "start": 1304, "end": 1306, "matched_text": "RSV", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NEURITE", "start": 1594, "end": 1600, "matched_text": "NEURITE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 1623, "end": 1628, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 1631, "end": 1645, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EMBRYONIC", "start": 1669, "end": 1677, "matched_text": "EMBRYONIC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "STEM CELL", "start": 1679, "end": 1687, "matched_text": "STEM CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 1991, "end": 1997, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}]}

One of the major challenges this delivery systems face is their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier; hence, the development of nanoparticle delivery systems incorporates the required active component and utilizes different mechanisms such as transcytosis, cell-mediated transport, or advanced techniques to surpass the blood-brain barrier. Bioactive components possess multiple advantages such as being anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in nature. They also target the main pathology involved in the aggregation of amyloid fibres and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Various bioactive nanoparticles have been demonstrated in disease models to operate on certain targets and facilitate blood-brain barrier crossing. The article also covers the salient features of some of the nanoparticle systems under investigation separating them based on the norms of those aimed at addressing various disease pathologies. Despite being able to address the main issues with traditional drug delivery, they nevertheless have some disadvantages, such as toxicity, bioavailability, and regulatory barriers. However, the prospects for bioactive nanoparticles appear bright.", "entities": [{"entity": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "start": 1, "end": 19, "matched_text": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DEMENTIA", "start": 46, "end": 53, "matched_text": "DEMENTIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DEMENTIA", "start": 46, "end": 53, "matched_text": "DEMENTIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AFFECTED", "start": 78, "end": 85, "matched_text": "AFFECTED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 89, "end": 93, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 156, "end": 159, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TAU", "start": 176, "end": 178, "matched_text": "TAU", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 201, "end": 207, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES", "start": 281, "end": 303, "matched_text": "NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SENILE PLAQUES", "start": 309, "end": 322, "matched_text": "SENILE PLAQUES", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 371, "end": 386, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NEUROINFLAMMATION", "start": 392, "end": 408, "matched_text": "NEUROINFLAMMATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "FACE", "start": 618, "end": 621, "matched_text": "FACE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FACE", "start": 618, "end": 621, "matched_text": "FACE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 655, "end": 659, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BRAIN", "start": 661, "end": 665, "matched_text": "BRAIN", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TRANSCYTOSIS", "start": 817, "end": 828, "matched_text": "TRANSCYTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 831, "end": 834, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 831, "end": 834, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSPORT", "start": 845, "end": 853, "matched_text": "TRANSPORT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 1044, "end": 1047, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 1109, "end": 1128, "matched_text": "HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 1552, "end": 1555, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BRIGHT", "start": 1728, "end": 1733, "matched_text": "BRIGHT", "type": "protein"}]}

Baseline cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). The results showed that 83 (33.2%) patients improved, 84 (33.6%) remained stable, and 83 (33.2%) experienced cognitive decline. The difference between the two groups was not significant with respect to cognitive outcomes (Chi-square = 0.08, df = 2, N = 250, p = 0.96). However, rivastigmine was associated with a higher rate of side effects (65, or 52%), which could hinder adherence. Both groups had an average of 1.48 hospitalization episodes per patient. Biomarker analysis suggested that 144 (57.6%) of patients tested positive for amyloid on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis data, illustrated through mean values, showed amyloid beta at 546.38 pg/mL and tau at 219.85 pg/mL - both linked to cognitive decline. Higher levels of tau were significantly correlated with greater cognitive decline. Statistically, there were significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of MMSE scores and CSF biomarkers (p < 0.05). Although there was no statistically significant difference in cognitive outcomes between the drugs, subgroup analysis revealed significant differences in baseline MMSE scores and CSF biomarker levels (p < 0.05), suggesting heterogeneity in disease severity. Therefore, personalized strategies for managing patients with AD should be constructed based on the drug's side effect profile, comorbidities, and biomarker status.

{"text": "The long-term effect of high altitude hypoxia (HAH) exposure is a relevant problem in cardiovascular biomechanics, that has not yet been fully assessed. Regarding this, the study examined the passive viscoelastic response of the descending thoracic aorta of individuals exposed to HAH. Through a guinea-pig animal model, subjected to either normoxic-normobaric or HAH conditions (groups N and H, respectively), biaxial tensile and uniaxial stress relaxation tests were performed on artery samples. The experimental data obtained from these biomechanical tests allowed us to characterize an anisotropic quasi-linear viscoelastic model based on the Gasser-Holzapfel-Ogden (GHO) hyperelastic material. Among the main results, biaxial tensile tests exhibited a trend towards a higher stiffness (at high stretch levels) in the hypoxic group. Results of stress relaxation tests revealed a similar behavior between groups, at both the initial, more pronounced stress-relaxation stage, attributed to the effect of elastin fibers, and at the second stage, with a less pronounced decrease in stress due to the role of collagen fibers. Our study suggests that although HAH does not alter significantly the passive elastic and viscous properties of aortic tissue under ex-vivo conditions, there is a tendency to material stiffening to supra-physiological levels.

However, the exact effect of MCPIP1 on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA formation is currently unknown. MCPIP1 deficiency reduced AAA formation in Ang II-induced mice. Less collagen and elastin degradation were observed in MCPIP1 deficient mice treated with Ang II. Ang II decreased Î±SMA and SM22Î± levels in aortas and VSMCs, whereas MCPIP1 deficiency reduced this decrease. MCPIP1 deficiency also attenuated Ang II-induced expression of MAPK signaling-associated proteins in aortas and VSMCs. Silencing MCPIP1 decreased proliferation and migration in Ang II-induced VSMCs. Furthermore, inactivation of ERK1/2 with PD98059 reduced Ang II-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Dual luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results confirmed that MCPIP1 was transcriptionally regulated by KLF4. KLF4 knockdown reversed the facilitating effect of Ang II on MCPIP1 expression.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory and provide a promising alternative to treat fibrosis, but face translational challenges due to poor tissue targeting and retention.

Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of using stromal extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking elastin-alginate cryoelectrospun scaffolds (CES) for MSC delivery. Using MSC-like primary embryonic salivary mesenchyme cells (SMSCs), we demonstrated that CES supported viable, healthy and non-fibrotic long-term stromal cell maintenance while suppressing the fibrotic phenotype in myofibroblasts. We established an in vitro fibrosis model by coculturing SMSCs and myofibroblasts on CES and validated that SMSCs on CES imparted anti-fibrotic effects on myofibroblasts; however, these effects were suppressed by TGF-Î²1. In vivo orthotopic implantation of CES and SMSC-CES constructs showed that CES were biocompatible, non-inflammatory, and non-fibrotic, however, they did not remediate fibrosis. Further, supplementation of anti-fibrotic FGF2 to the in vitro fibrosis model demonstrated partial rescue of the anti-fibrotic effects of SMSC-CES constructs on myofibroblasts stimulated by TGF-Î²1 signaling.

{"text": "To introduce the Aortic and Arterial Vulnerability Spectrum (AAVS), a biologically grounded conceptual framework designed to improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making in aortopathy and arteriopathy by incorporating substrate-level insights. The framework was developed using a structured, hypothesis-driven process that integrates high-reliability systems theory, extracellular matrix biology, and clinical outcome patterns. A novel application of skin biopsy is introduced as a tissue-level surrogate for aortic wall integrity. Histological and transmission electron microscopy analyses were used to identify gradable ultrastructural features of collagen and elastin organization. The AAVS framework defines three biological risk domains, substrate vulnerability, clinical fragility, and mechanisms of failure, each linked to a proposed scoring system under development. Clinical case illustrations demonstrate conceptual utility. The three domains of biological risk are (1) substrate vulnerability, assessed through the AAVS Score of histological; and ultrastructural analysis of skin biopsy as a surrogate for aortic tissue integrity; (2) clinical fragility, captured by the Vascular Fragility Score, which quantifies phenotypic indicators of vascular fragility from clinical history, physical findings, and imaging; and (3) mechanisms of failure, modeled by substrate vulnerability progression, a longitudinal, dynamic modeling system that tracks substrate vulnerability progression over time toward aortic failure and includes vascular health modifiers that alter mismatch progression over time. AAVS introduces a structured clinical reasoning framework and skin biopsy-based scoring approach for risk stratification in aortopathy and arteriopathy. It reframes failure as a progressive biological process shaped by substrate integrity, not just anatomy or procedural success. Although the scoring systems remain under development, the cognitive framework offers immediate utility for case interpretation, biologically matched surgical planning, and future longitudinal modeling.

After four weeks of BAPN administration followed by 24 h of Ang II infusion, a murine model with characteristics similar to human TAD was reliably induced, and the success rate of TAD model construction was significantly improved.

{"text": "The global health landscape continues to face significant challenges from emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens, notably Monkeypox virus (MPXV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Traditional vaccine approaches often fall short in providing robust and long-lasting immunity against these evolving threats. Nanotechnology offers transformative potential in this regard, enabling precise modulation and enhancement of immune responses through innovative nanovaccine platforms. This review delves into the latest advancements in nanotechnology-driven vaccine research targeting MPXV and RSV, focusing on the unique capabilities of nanoparticles (NPs) to optimize antigen delivery, stabilize vaccine formulations, and modulate immune responses. For MPXV, promising approaches include mRNA-lipid nanoparticles, antigen-conjugated nanoscaffolds, and virosome- or liposome-based nanovaccines, each demonstrating enhanced antigen stability and potent immunogenicity in preclinical models. RSV nanovaccine development leverages diverse nanoplatforms, such as nanocages, virus-like particles, elastin-like polypeptides, mRNA-lipid NPs, and self-aggregating lipopeptides, enabling precise antigen presentation and robust mucosal and systemic immunity. We highlight how these nanoparticle-based vaccines mimic viral structures, facilitating targeted interactions with antigen-presenting cells, optimizing antigen presentation, and promoting strong cellular and humoral immune responses. Despite these advances, clinical translation remains a challenge, with no approved MPXV or RSV nanovaccines currently available.

{"text": "Vascular calcification and osteoporosis are interrelated diseases, with estrogen being the key link between them. Estrogen binds to receptors in cells, triggering various signaling pathways, which is its primary mode of action. Additionally, estrogen can interact with other macromolecules in the environment, influencing both vascular calcification and osteoporosis. Environmental cholesterol and vitamin D are directly or indirectly related to estrogen in ways that affect these conditions. Collagen and elastin, critical components of the extracellular matrix, significantly influence vascular calcification and osteoporosis. There is a potential link between estrogen and these proteins in inhibiting these diseases. Physical stimuli can also affect the regulation of estrogen on vascular calcification and osteoporosis. Current research has mainly focused on estrogen and its receptors, while the roles of macromolecules, collagen, elastin, and physical stimuli have not been thoroughly studied.

{"text": "Microneedle radiofrequency (MRF) is a promising skin rejuvenation treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying its effects on extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the immediate histological effects of MRF under varying settings, its short-term impact on collagen and elastin synthesis, and the roles of fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Porcine abdominal skin was treated with an MRF device containing 49 insulated microneedles using varying energy parameters (8-12 W; 100-300 ms). Immediate histological responses to treatment were evaluated through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Short-term changes in collagen and elastin synthesis at Days 7 and 28 posttreatment were assessed via picrosirius red and Victoria blue staining. Additionally, expression and distribution of ECM remodeling-related proteins (MMPs, TGF-Î², EGF, Ki67) and ADSCs were analyzed by multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and western blot analysis. H&E staining revealed thermal coagulation zones in the dermis immediately after MRF treatment, with zone size increasing with higher power and longer pulse durations (p < 0.05). By Day 28, Collagen I and III densities and organization significantly improved, with the Collagen I/III ratio rising to 7.05 Â± 1.21 in the treatment area (p < 0.01) and 3.90 Â± 0.37 in the surrounding dermis (p < 0.001). Elastic fibers also showed increased density. mIHC staining demonstrated significant upregulation of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 expression in treated and surrounding dermal regions by Day 7 (p < 0.01); however, by Day 28, MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expression significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas MMP-3 remained elevated. Furthermore, expression levels of TGF-Î², EGF, and Ki67 significantly increased by Day 28 (p < 0.05). mIHC analysis of the fibroblast marker FSP-1 coexpression, along with Western blot analysis of Collagen I, Collagen III, MMP-1, MMP-3, TGF-Î², and EGF, revealed similar trends. Notably, significant expression of ADSC markers was detected at Day 7 posttreatment (p < 0.01). MRF predominantly promotes the synthesis of Collagen I and Collagen III, increasing the Collagen I/III ratio, and regulates the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, TGF-Î², and EGF. These factors collectively drive fibroblast activation, migration, and ECM remodeling. These changes are indicative of the potential for MRF to support skin regeneration and rejuvenation.

{"text": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs), distinguished by their abilities to differentiate and self-renew, play a pivotal role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms that sustain CSCs in CRC remain unclear. This study aimed to identify and characterize gene expressions associated with CRC stemness. We applied a 1-class logistic regression machine learning model to calculate the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) for CRC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and cBioPortal databases, adjusting the mRNAsi by tumor purity. Clinical features of CRC were considered in assessing both mRNAsi and adjusted mRNAsi levels. Using DESeq2, we screened differentially expressed genes between high and low mRNAsi groups. Enrichment analysis provided functional annotation for these differentially expressed genes. Key genes linked to mRNAsi were identified using the Kaplan-Meier plotter and Cytoscape software, followed by an evaluation of their prognostic significance. Potential small-molecule compounds targeting the CRC stemness signature were explored via L1000FWD, DGIdb, and CMap databases. CRC samples with higher mRNAsi or adjusted mRNAsi values showed improved disease-free survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Strong correlation between clinical characteristics of CSCs and mRNAsi was observed; CMS4 subtype CRC patients had lower mRNAsi with worse DSS and PFS. Ten key genes associated with mRNAsi were identified: collagen type I alpha 1, fibrillin 1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, SPP1, BGN, COL5A1, FN1, elastin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, collagen type I alpha 2. Lower expression of these genes correlated with better PFS and DSS. High correlation among these genes was confirmed in the protein-protein interaction network.

{"text": "Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a rare and heterogeneous form of dystrophinopathy caused by expression of altered dystrophin proteins, as a consequence of in-frame genetic mutations. The majority of the BMD biomarker studies employ targeted approaches and focus on translating findings from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a more severe disease form with clinical similarities but caused by out-of-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene. Importantly, DMD therapies assume that disease progression can be slowed by promoting the expression of truncated dystrophin comparable to what occurs in BMD patients. In this study, we explore similarities and differences in protein trajectories over time between BMD and DMD serum, and explore proteins related to motor function performance. Serum samples collected from 34 BMD patients, in a prospective longitudinal 3-year study, and 19 DMD patients, were analyzed by using Data Independent Acquisition Tandem Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS). Subsequent normalization, linear mixed effects model was employed to identify proteins associated with physical tests and dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. Analysis was also performed to explore the discrepancy between DMD and BMD biomarker abundance trajectories over time. Linear mixed effects models identified 20 proteins with altered longitudinal signatures between DMD and BMD, including creatine kinase M-type (CKM) pyruvate kinase (PKM), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M). Furthermore, several proteins related to innate immune response were associated with motor function in BMD patients. In particular, A2M displayed an altered time-dependent decline in relation to dystrophin expression in the tibialis anterior muscle. Our study revealed differences in the serum proteome between BMD and DMD, which comprises proteins involved in the immune response, extracellular matrix organization and hemostasis but not muscle leakage proteins significantly associated with disease progression in DMD. If further evaluated and validated, these biomarker candidates may offer means to monitor disease progression in BMD patients. A2M is of particular interest due to its association with dystrophin expression in BMD muscle and higher abundance in DMD patients in comparison to BMD. If validated, A2M could be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in therapeutic clinical trials aiming to restore dystrophin expression.", "entities": [{"entity": "BECKER MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY", "start": 1, "end": 25, "matched_text": "BECKER MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BMD", "start": 28, "end": 30, "matched_text": "BMD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DYSTROPHIN", "start": 118, "end": 127, "matched_text": "DYSTROPHIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY", "start": 295, "end": 321, "matched_text": "DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DMD", "start": 324, "end": 326, "matched_text": "DMD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 344, "end": 350, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 439, "end": 442, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 439, "end": 442, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 671, "end": 677, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 671, "end": 677, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MOTOR", "start": 761, "end": 765, "matched_text": "MOTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DIA", "start": 978, "end": 980, "matched_text": "DIA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CREATINE KINASE M-TYPE", "start": 1389, "end": 1410, "matched_text": "CREATINE KINASE M-TYPE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CKM", "start": 1413, "end": 1415, "matched_text": "CKM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PKM", "start": 1435, "end": 1437, "matched_text": "PKM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FIBRINOGEN GAMMA CHAIN", "start": 1441, "end": 1462, "matched_text": "FIBRINOGEN GAMMA CHAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FIBRINOGEN GAMMA CHAIN", "start": 1441, "end": 1462, "matched_text": "FIBRINOGEN GAMMA CHAIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FGG", "start": 1465, "end": 1467, "matched_text": "FGG", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LDHB", "start": 1496, "end": 1499, "matched_text": "LDHB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALPHA-2-MACROGLOBULIN", "start": 1506, "end": 1526, "matched_text": "ALPHA-2-MACROGLOBULIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "A2M", "start": 1529, "end": 1531, "matched_text": "A2M", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE", "start": 1576, "end": 1597, "matched_text": "INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TIBIALIS ANTERIOR", "start": 1759, "end": 1775, "matched_text": "TIBIALIS ANTERIOR", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "IMMUNE RESPONSE", "start": 1900, "end": 1914, "matched_text": "IMMUNE RESPONSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX ORGANIZATION", "start": 1917, "end": 1949, "matched_text": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX ORGANIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HEMOSTASIS", "start": 1955, "end": 1964, "matched_text": "HEMOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}]}

{"text": "Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite international initiatives, significant variability persists in how PPH is diagnosed and managed. This integrative review synthesizes findings from four recent Cochrane systematic reviews published in 2024 and 2025, aiming to inform clinical practice and highlight research gaps. The included reviews examined: (1) diagnostic accuracy of tools during vaginal birth, (2) implementation strategies for WHO guidelines, (3) transfusion of blood and blood products, and (4) intraoperative cell salvage during cesarean delivery. Calibrated blood loss tools combined with clinical observation demonstrated superior performance compared to visual estimation, with pooled sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95%. Multicomponent strategies modestly improved adherence to WHO-recommended practices, yet had limited impact on maternal mortality and ICU admissions. Evidence regarding transfusion thresholds, fibrinogen concentrate, and cryoprecipitate was of low certainty and inconclusive. Intraoperative cell salvage showed potential benefits, including a reduction in total blood loss (mean difference -113.6 mL) and a modest increase in postpartum hemoglobin (mean difference +6.14 g/L), although the overall quality of evidence remains low.

It is purported that ASV may mitigate the inflammatory response, cardiac congestion, or fibrosis, but evidence supporting this assertion is sparse. This ancillary analysis of the multicentre, randomised, open-label TEAM-ASV I trial assessed patients with analysable blood samples at baseline and 12-week follow-up. Patients were randomised to early ASV treatment in addition to standard care for AMI and standard care alone (control).

This retrospective cohort research analyzed the clinical data of 1,263 older adult patients with hip fractures who underwent surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University from January 2014 to December 2022. Patients receiving surgical treatment during January 2014 to December 2019 (864 cases) for the model development and further, data from the same centre with same inclusion criteria from January 2020 to December 2022 (399 cases) for the external validation of the model. The univariate and multivariable logistic regression were utilized to identify independent risk factors linked to one-year mortality. A predictive nomogram was subsequently developed. The discriminatory power of the model and its accuracy were monitored by utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Furthermore, visual risk applications were developed to enhance usability. The one-year mortality is 16.8%. A total of seven predictors, namely age, body mass index (BMI), fibrinogen (FIB), stroke, dementia, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists), intraoperative blood transfusion were identified by multivariate analysis from a total of 65 variables studied. The model constructed using these seven predictors displayed medium prediction ability, with an area under the ROC of 0.775 in the training set and 0.740 in the validation set. The calibration curve shows a good degree of fitting between the predicted and observed probabilities. The DCA curve showed that the nomogram could be applied clinically if the risk threshold was between 8 and 64%, which was found to be between 6 and 80% in the external validation. Independent factors, including age, BMI, preoperative fibrinogen level, stroke, dementia, ASA, intraoperative blood transfusion are pivotal in influencing one-year survival rate for patients with hip fractures.

A total of 462 patients who underwent THA at the our hospital from January 2019 to December 2023 were included in the study. Based on the occurrence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis during follow-up, patients were divided into a DVT group (n = 65) and a non-DVT group (n = 397). The following variables were retrospectively analyzed for both groups: gender, age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, medical history, operative time, anesthesia method, and preoperative and postoperative laboratory indicators (including triglycerides, TC, fibrinogen, hemoglobin, red cell distribution width, albumin, platelet count, D-dimer, INR, and FDP). Univariate analysis was conducted for these factors, with statistically significant variables subsequently included in a binary logistic regression model to examine their association with post-THA lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. ROC curve analysis was employed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of individual risk factors for DVT diagnosis, followed by development of a multivariate combined ROC curve model to assess its diagnostic value for DVT. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative hematocrit (P = 0.015, OR = 1.082), preoperative triglyceride levels (P = 0.030, OR = 1.275), preoperative platelet count (P = 0.008, OR = 1.005), preoperative D-dimer level (P < 0.001, OR = 3.407), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.004, OR = 2.735), smoking history (P = 0.003, OR = 2.733), and hypertension (P = 0.002, OR = 2.795) showed significant positive associations with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis following THA. These factors were identified as independent risk factors for post-THA DVT development. Preoperative hematocrit, triglycerides (TG), platelet count, D-dimer levels, smoking status, along with pre-existing hypertension and diabetes mellitus were all identified as significant risk factors for developing deep vein thrombosis following total hip arthroplasty.

{"text": "Neuroinflammation, a defining feature of numerous neurological disorders, arises predominantly from activating immune cells such as microglia, which play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system. Microglial activation and polarization exhibit a dual nature, mediating both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects. Fibrinogen, as a potent pro-inflammatory mediator, interacts with microglia and is implicated in the progression of various neurological conditions. This study investigates the effects of fibrinogen and the exogenous STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone on primary microglial function. Primary microglial cells were isolated from neonatal C57BL/6 mice and subsequently treated with fibrinogen and the STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone. Inflammatory marker expression was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while protein levels of JAK2 and STAT3 were determined using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Fibrinogen exposure upregulated STAT3 and JAK2 phosphorylation in primary microglial cells. Cryptotanshinone treatment effectively attenuated STAT3 phosphorylation while concurrently downregulating JAK2 activation. Furthermore, fibrinogen significantly enhanced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1Î², while the transcription levels of TGF-Î² remained unchanged. This study demonstrates that fibrinogen stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary microglial cells by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

The mutations were targeted to genes encoding seed antinutritional components, as previously described in a triple null soybean carrying knockout alleles for a Kunitz trypsin inhibitor, a soybean agglutinin, and the allergen P34 protein. The products developed from these respective genetic improvement pipelines were tested for differences between the triple-mutant lines and their parental lines. Analyses included genomics, seed proteomics, trypsin inhibition, seed protein digestibility, and harvestable yield of the different lines.

In vitro, it exhibited immunomodulatory properties and displayed resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila in M. salmoides head kidney lymphocytes. An eight-week in vivo study showed that orally supplemented E. lactis A1 significantly promoted growth, enhanced intestinal trypsin and lipase activities, increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and reduced the malondialdehyde levels. Diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota were positively modulated by E. lactis A1. Moreover, it effectively improved intestinal morphology by increasing villus height and improving resistance against A. hydrophila infection, as indicated by improved intestinal integrity, reduced blood pathogen counts, and increased fish survival rates.

To address these challenges, we employed a streamlined and practical approach for the efficient isolation and stable cultivation of chicken gonadal PGCs. Chicken gonadal PGCs were isolated from embryonic gonads, surgically removed and dissociated using trypsin. The PGCs were isolated by exploiting differential adhesion properties, allowing fibroblasts to attach while PGCs remained suspended. Cultivation was performed with mitotically inactivated STO feeder cells under optimized culture conditions. PGCs proliferated robustly, reaching over 105 cells within one month, which is comparable to previously reported methods. Characterization assays confirmed the expression of PGC-specific markers, including SSEA-1 and DAZL, along with pluripotency-related genes such as OCT4 and NANOG. Additionally, labeled PGCs successfully migrated to recipient embryonic gonads, where they were identified through fluorescence analysis.

However, many patients do not recall tick bites, fueling speculation about alternative transmission routes, particularly via mosquito bites. This belief is reinforced by studies reporting Borrelia presence in mosquitoes. This study evaluates whether three mosquito species can acquire, maintain, and transmit Borrelia spirochetes. Mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex pipiens biotype molestus) were fed on Borrelia-infected mice to assess pathogen acquisition. Additional experiments involved ex vivo feeding on Borrelia-enriched blood to examine spirochete persistence in the mosquito gut. The potential for mechanical transmission was tested by simulating interrupted feeding between infected and naive hosts. The role of trypsin in Borrelia survival and infectivity was also investigated. Mosquitoes exhibited low efficiency in acquiring Borrelia from infected hosts. Spirochetes artificially introduced through ex vivo blood meals were rapidly eliminated during digestion, primarily due to trypsin activity. Inhibition of trypsin prolonged spirochete persistence and infectivity in the mosquito gut. Mechanical transmission experiments revealed no evidence of Borrelia transmission from infected to naive hosts. Our findings demonstrate that mosquitoes lack the biological capacity to efficiently acquire and maintain B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes and are unable to transmit them through natural or mechanical means.

The method performance showed that these two peptides could distinguish CHG from other animal hide gelatins. The CPA and CPB detection limits were 5Î¼g/kg and 3Î¼g/kg, respectively. LC-MS/MS analysis detected CPA and CPB in 4.5% of market-collected DHG samples (n=157), confirming the prevalence of this emerging adulteration practice.

Chronic inhibition of EP and trypsin (EP/T) with camostat (Foipan, FOY-305) or its active metabolite (FOY-251) causes weight loss in obese mice by reducing intestinal protein absorption and suppression of food intake, however, the mechanisms leading to appetite suppression are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) signaling mediates the anorectic effects of EP/T inhibition using a CCK1R inhibitor (loxiglumide) or CCK1R knockout (KO) mice. Acute treatment with loxiglumide was able to partially reverse FOY-251-induced gallbladder contraction and delayed gastric emptying in mice. Chronic co-administration of loxiglumide reversed FOY-251 mediated effects on food intake and metabolism in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Chronic dosing of FOY-251 caused similar reductions in food intake but greater weight loss in CCK1R KO mice compared to wildtype (WT) mice, primarily due to fat mass loss. Pair fed (PF) groups revealed food intake-dependent and -independent mechanisms of weight loss by FOY-251. Notably, FOY-251 treatment induced sustained weight loss, whereas body weight loss rebounded in PF animals. In CCKR1 KO mice, FOY-251 caused greater weight loss, and increased protein calorie loss relative to that in WT mice, while having no effect on glycemic control or FGF21.

However, its specific association with atopic dermatitis (AD) remains unclear. The objective is to investigate the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of YTHDF1 in AD. The expression of YTHDF1 was investigated by bioinformatics analysis and skin lesions of AD patients. The functional role and upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms of YTHDF1 were examined through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of YTHDF1 in the AD mouse model was evaluated for its therapeutic potential. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the YTHDF1 mRNA level in the skin lesions of AD was significantly higher than that in healthy people. YTHDF1 expression was significantly elevated in AD skin lesions, the DNCB-induced AD mouse model, and primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells stimulated with interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, compared to controls. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that upregulation of YTHDF1 in AD exacerbated cell proliferation and inhibited keratinization by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was modulated via the IL-4/IL-13/STAT3 axis.

{"text": "Daily sunlight exposure impacts the structural integrity and chemical composition of hair in both reversible and permanent manners. Although keratin-based treatments have been popularly used to repair damaged hair, their effects in the recovery of the hair damage caused by UV light have not been well studied. Moreover, limitations related to keratin penetration depth and duration of effect persist. Encapsulating active ingredients in liposomes has been shown to enhance their stability, bioavailability and permeability. Thus, we aimed to design cationic liposomes encapsulated with keratin to enhance the recovery effects of photo-damaged hair. We prepared keratin-incorporated cationic liposomes (KLs) via high-pressure homogenization and assessed their physical properties via hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses. The physical and chemical damage level of hair samples before and after treatment, such as hair smoothness, protein degradation and lipid peroxidation, were subsequently investigated using electron microscopy and different spectroscopies. The results indicated that the cationic liposomes fabricated by high-pressure homogenization method had combined unilamellar and multilamellar structures. Compared with the keratin solution, the KL suspension significantly improved the permeation of keratin into the cortex during a 24-h incubation. Moreover, 24 and 48-h UV-exposed hairs showed enhanced recovery when incubated with keratin liposomes for 24 h, as evidenced by the observation of a smoother hair surface using electron microscopy. We observed that treatment with keratin liposomes significantly reduced protein denaturation and lipid peroxidation in the photo-damaged hairs. We anticipate that cationic liposome-assisted keratin delivery may serve as an effective method for restoring photo-damaged hair in both the physical and chemical dimensions. L'exposition quotidienne au soleil a un impact sur l'intÃ©gritÃ© structurelle et la composition chimique des cheveux, de maniÃ¨re rÃ©versible ou permanente.

En outre, les limitations liÃ©es Ã la profondeur de pÃ©nÃ©tration de la kÃ©ratine et Ã la durÃ©e de l'effet persistent. Il a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©montrÃ© que l'encapsulation de principes actifs dans les liposomes amÃ©liore leur stabilitÃ©, leur biodisponibilitÃ© et leur permÃ©abilitÃ©. Ainsi, nous avons cherchÃ© Ã concevoir des liposomes cationiques encapsulÃ©s dans de la kÃ©ratine pour amÃ©liorer les effets de rÃ©cupÃ©ration des cheveux photoâendommagÃ©s. MÃTHODES: Nous avons prÃ©parÃ© des liposomes cationiques incorporÃ©s Ã la kÃ©ratine (KL) par homogÃ©nÃ©isation Ã haute pression et Ã©valuÃ© leurs propriÃ©tÃ©s physiques par l'analyse de la taille hydrodynamique, du potentiel zÃªta, de la microscopie Ã©lectronique et de la diffraction des rayons X.

RCS was prepared through electron beam irradiation and cross-linking followed by freeze-drying. Its properties were evaluated, including Fourier transform infrared analysis, swelling behavior, microscopic observation, porosity measurement, compression modulus and structural stability. In a rat gingival recession model with 96 rats divided into four groups, the root coverage index and gingival health indices were measured, and histological analyses were conducted. The cross-linked network structure of RCS provided excellent mechanical properties and stability. In the rat model, RCS effectively promoted gingival regeneration, with the RCS group achieving a root coverage index of 87.7 Â± 2.7 %, which was 54.13 %, 42.83 % and 8.41 % higher than that of the sham operation group, non-crosslinked group and chemical crosslinked group respectively. Histological analysis showed that RCS promoted anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, enhanced collagen deposition and gingival lamina propria fiber density and increased angiogenesis. Additionally, RCS exhibited good biosafety, as blood indices and organ coefficients remained normal.

Here we sought to identify novel interaction partners of SCHAD that might be particularly relevant for the endocrine pancreas. Employing the SCHAD protein as bait, we performed yeast 2-hybrid screening of a cDNA library made from human islets of Langerhans. Surprisingly, the screening revealed the intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) as a putative interaction partner of SCHAD with very high confidence. Previous reports have linked K8 to glucose homeostasis, and we confirmed the SCHAD interaction by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells. SCHAD and K8 expression were then characterized in the human Î²-cell model EndoC-Î²H1. By using proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that stimulating the cells with a high level of glucose triggered a transient increase in the interaction. However, when studying knockout mice, we found that the loss of either K8 or SCHAD did not change the expression level of the other interaction partner. Still, when K8 knockout mice were challenged with a ketogenic diet, upregulation of SCHAD expression was blunted compared to the upregulation observed in wildtype littermates.

This study aims to elucidate the transcriptional landscape of AAK by characterizing the gene expression profiles of corneal epithelial cells in a patient with congenital aniridia. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on epithelial tissues collected from the clear central corneal region and limbus of a 48-year-old female patient with congenital aniridia. The transcriptomic profiles were compared with those of healthy control samples. scRNA-seq analysis revealed that a subpopulation of cells from the clear central corneal region expressed the cornea-specific keratins KRT3 and KRT12 despite a significant reduction in PAX6 expression. These cells exhibited corneal, conjunctival, or mixed gene signatures. Genes associated with wound healing and apoptosis were upregulated in the cornea-like cells from the aniridic cornea, indicating a chronic wound healing state. Elevated KLF4 expression and regulon activity were observed in these cornea-like cells. Most limbal epithelial cells exhibited conjunctiva-like characteristics, reflecting a loss of limbal cell identity.

This study aims to compare the developmental characteristics of soft palate muscles in miniature pigs and mice at various stages to better understand the patterns in large mammals. Specimens of soft palate were collected from human embryos, miniature pigs and mice at different stages. Furthermore, comprehensive gross observations, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, and immunohistochemical analyses for myosin heavy chain and Hypermethylated cancer 1 (Hic1) were conducted on multiple dissected sections. Mature soft palatal musculature exhibited anatomical and histological similarities across the three species. Notably, miniature pigs exhibited the uvula structure and uvula muscle development comparable to humans. Embryonic day 40 (E40, equivalent to human embryonic week 11, E11w) represented the early developmental stage of the uvula muscle, characterized by scattered muscle cells not yet coalescing into multinucleated fibres. By E45 (aligned with human E12w), the muscle bundles reached maturity, exhibiting two oriented fibre bundles flanking the midline. Levator veli palatini muscle and palatopharyngeus of miniature pigs exhibited a distinct course pattern due to the presence of the uvula muscle. Hic1+ perimysial cells were observed at the extending edge of the developing palatopharyngeus of miniature pigs, indicating a potential guiding role in the migration of myogenic cells.

However, knowledge of human PF anatomy remains reliant on data generated in animal models, obscuring understanding of the substrate underpinning dysrhythmia and pacing strategies. This study sought to establish and utilize a human biomarker to delineate PF anatomy in humans. RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis of transcriptomes from human hearts (N = 10) revealed 99 genes up-regulated in PFs vs ventricular myocardium and endocardium. Whole-mount megablock cross-sectional analysis was performed with cardiac troponin, MYL4, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's Trichrome, pro-ANP, and GJA5 colocalization. Comparative transcriptomics from human hearts (N = 10) identified myosin light chain 4 (MYL4) as a promising human PF marker for distinguishing conductive from contractile myocardium. Using PF-rich bundle branch and subendocardial regions, MYL4 specificity was validated using canonical PF markers in human (n = 3), dog (n = 3), goat (n = 3), and pig (n = 3) hearts. Cross-sectional histology of the entire human ventricular myocardium uncovered a deep-seated network of transmurally intercalated, MYL4-positive PFs. This previously unrecognized distribution of the cardiac conduction system accounted for over 60% of human myocardial PF content.

Thus, we expected that C. nutans could shift skeletal muscle from fast to slow muscle fibers via AMPK signaling and promote mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby enhancing exercise fatigue resistance. This hypothesis was tested in the present study using the C2C12 myotube model. We identified vitexin, isovitexin, orientin, schaftoside, rutin, quercetin, and apigenin in the ethanolic extract of C. nutans leaves (EECN). EECN substantially boosted the protein expression of slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, and reduced fast MyHC. EECN significantly increased ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential in myotubes. EECN activated AMPK signaling, as well as upstream and downstream regulators. Furthermore, Compound C, which inhibited AMPK, significantly inhibited the effects above in C2C12 myotubes. In conclusion, EECN transformed skeletal muscle from fast to slow fibers and improved mitochondrial function via AMPK signaling pathway, and may play an important role in anti-exercise fatigue activity.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²) in promoting skeletal muscle atrophy in CKD. A combined model of 2/3 nephrectomy and unilateral ureteral ligation, as we previously reported, was used for CKD mice. Skeletal muscle weight and changes in skeletal muscle fiber twitch type were evaluated. Using C2C12 cells, a skeletal muscle myoblast cell line, molecules that induce a reduction in type IIa muscle fibers in CKD were identified. The identified molecule, TGF-Î², was administered to mice to investigate its effects on muscle fiber-type changes. Furthermore, the effects of administering a TGF-Î² inhibitor to CKD mice were evaluated. In CKD mice, myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-specific antibody immunostaining showed an increase in atrophied MyHC IIa (oxidative twitch) muscle fibers. CKD mouse serum preferentially induces MyHC IIa fiber atrophy in C2C12 cells. TGF-Î²-treated mice had reduced levels of oxidative metabolic skeletal muscle and oxidative type IIa fiber, similar to CKD mice. Furthermore, TGF-Î² inhibitor treatment prevented the CKD-associated decrease in oxidative type IIa muscle fiber size and reduced exercise capacity. These findings indicate that TGF-Î² causes skeletal muscle deterioration in CKD by reducing oxidative metabolism and inducing type IIa fiber atrophy. In addition, our results emphasize that reversing the disrupted MyHC phenotype in CKD is a potential therapeutic target for CKD-induced muscle atrophy.", "entities": [{"entity": "SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY", "start": 74, "end": 96, "matched_text": "SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY", "start": 74, "end": 96, "matched_text": "SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY", "start": 74, "end": 96, "matched_text": "SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 101, "end": 122, "matched_text": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 101, "end": 122, "matched_text": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 185, "end": 188, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 220, "end": 223, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UNILATERAL", "start": 319, "end": 328, "matched_text": "UNILATERAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 393, "end": 396, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MUSCLE FIBER", "start": 446, "end": 457, "matched_text": "MUSCLE FIBER", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 533, "end": 536, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 533, "end": 536, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 643, "end": 650, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 643, "end": 650, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ANTIBODY", "start": 880, "end": 887, "matched_text": "ANTIBODY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ANTIBODY", "start": 880, "end": 887, "matched_text": "ANTIBODY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE METABOLISM", "start": 1427, "end": 1446, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHENOTYPE", "start": 1554, "end": 1562, "matched_text": "PHENOTYPE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MUSCLE ATROPHY", "start": 1621, "end": 1634, "matched_text": "MUSCLE ATROPHY", "type": "gene"}]}

Numerous studies have concentrated on investigating myocardial remodeling under varying loading conditions in animal models. The objective of this study was to compare myocardial responses in lesions with volume overload, specifically ventricular septal defects (VSD), and lesions with pressure overload, such as coarctation. For this purpose, three study groups have been involved: a VSD group ( The CoA groups displayed significant septal hypertrophy compared to the other two study groups: IVSd (CoA: 8 Â± 1.6 vs. VSD 5.7 Â± 0.9). LV dilatation was more marked in the VSD group: LV end-diastolic dimension (CoA: 30 Â± 3 vs. 25 Â± 1.7). Systolic septal and mitral annular velocities were reduced in the CoA group and intriguingly exaggerated in the VSD group: Septal basal systolic myocardial velocity: (VSD: 9 Â± 2 vs. CoA: 5 Â± 1 vs. Controls: 7 Â± 0.8). Myocardial GLS was markedly reduced in the CoA group. Besides the well-known eccentric-concentric hypertrophy paradigm in volume-pressure loading of the myocardium, pressure load seems to reduce myocardial velocities and LV function to a greater extent than volume loading.

{"text": "Inhibiting contractility by targeting cardiac myosin is an effective treatment for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Aficamten is a second in class myosin inhibitor with promising clinical data showing improvements in hemodynamics and symptoms in patients with HCM. While it is known that Aficamten inhibits force and cardiomyocyte contractility by stabilizing the weak pre-powerstroke conformation, effects on myosin structure and kinetics during loaded contraction are lacking. Permeabilized porcine cardiac tissue and myofibrils were used for single-molecule imaging of ATP turn over, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical measurements. Engineered heart tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes were used to evaluate effects on force and contraction kinetics. In contrast to Mavacamten, Aficamten does not structurally sequester myosin heads along the thick filament. Aficamten inhibits ATPase activity by shifting myosin heads from higher to slower ATPase state, with the emergence of a super slow biochemical nucleotide turnover state. This results in decreased force and calcium sensitivity without altering cross-bridge cycling. These contractile mechanical changes are comparable to Mavacamten. Our myofibril mechanical assay showed inhibition of force with accelerated relaxation. In EHTs, while Mavacamten and Aficamten inhibit cardiac twitch forces, Mavacamten reduces the activation kinetics while both result in faster relaxation. We used a combination of biochemical and biomechanical assays to show that Aficamten inhibits myosin ATPase without appreciably altering myosin structure. This is different from Mavacamten that strongly affects both. While both compounds inhibit contractility, differences in mechanisms of action and kinetics of force activation and relaxation could allow use in different patient populations.", "entities": [{"entity": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "start": 98, "end": 124, "matched_text": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "start": 98, "end": 124, "matched_text": "HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 526, "end": 531, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 569, "end": 576, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MOLECULE", "start": 569, "end": 576, "matched_text": "MOLECULE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RAY", "start": 606, "end": 608, "matched_text": "RAY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HEART", "start": 663, "end": 667, "matched_text": "HEART", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "STEM CELL", "start": 708, "end": 716, "matched_text": "STEM CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "THICK FILAMENT", "start": 890, "end": 903, "matched_text": "THICK FILAMENT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ATPASE ACTIVITY", "start": 925, "end": 939, "matched_text": "ATPASE ACTIVITY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MYOFIBRIL", "start": 1242, "end": 1250, "matched_text": "MYOFIBRIL", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large multi-protein structure that enables movement of macromolecules, such as mRNA and proteins, between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. There has been great interest in how the physical state of the NPC can influence nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. The hypothesis that the NPC may be mechanosensitive is supported by prior reports showing that the diameter of the NPC increases with nuclear envelope stretch as well as increased ECM stiffness. We therefore sought to develop a biosensor-based approach to determine if the NPC experiences mechanical tension. Using a previously developed FRET-force biosensor, known as TSmod, we developed a gp210 tension sensor. gp210 is a transmembrane nucleoporin, which may serve to anchor the NPC into the nuclear envelope. Using a CRISPR knock-in strategy, we developed a HeLa cell line which expresses the gp210 tension sensor at endogenous levels. Using this sensor, we observed that gp210 forces increase in response to osmotically induced nuclear swelling. Cell attachment, ECM stiffness, the nuclear LINC complex, chromatin condensation, and actomyosin contractility were all observed to influence gp210 forces. Surprisingly, gp210 forces were increased with chromatin relaxation and myosin light chain kinase inhibition, indicating that NPC forces may be differentially regulated from forces on the LINC complex. Our data support a hypothesis where nuclear strain, rather than cytoskeletal forces, is the predominant source for NPC forces. Our studies demonstrate that NPC proteins do experience mechanical tension. We anticipate that the gp210 force sensor will be of use for future studies of NPC mechanobiology.", "entities": [{"entity": "NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX", "start": 5, "end": 24, "matched_text": "NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 37, "end": 41, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 49, "end": 55, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 49, "end": 55, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NUCLEOPLASM", "start": 147, "end": 157, "matched_text": "NUCLEOPLASM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYTOPLASM", "start": 163, "end": 171, "matched_text": "CYTOPLASM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 207, "end": 209, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSPORT", "start": 275, "end": 283, "matched_text": "TRANSPORT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NUCLEAR ENVELOPE", "start": 420, "end": 435, "matched_text": "NUCLEAR ENVELOPE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ECM", "start": 466, "end": 468, "matched_text": "ECM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GP210", "start": 677, "end": 681, "matched_text": "GP210", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSMEMBRANE", "start": 710, "end": 722, "matched_text": "TRANSMEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HELA", "start": 847, "end": 850, "matched_text": "HELA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 852, "end": 855, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 852, "end": 855, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LINC COMPLEX", "start": 1080, "end": 1091, "matched_text": "LINC COMPLEX", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHROMATIN", "start": 1094, "end": 1102, "matched_text": "CHROMATIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ACTOMYOSIN", "start": 1122, "end": 1131, "matched_text": "ACTOMYOSIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIGHT", "start": 1271, "end": 1275, "matched_text": "LIGHT", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "The intestine plays numerous roles in the normal physiology of our body. Gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network linking the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional system integrates endocrine, neural, and immune signals, impacting host metabolism and cognition. The gut microbiota, a critical component of the GBA, significantly impacts gut hormones, neurotransmission, neural development, and other components of gut-brain-axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis facilitates communication via metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, Î³-amino butyric acid (GABA) and serotonin. The microbiota influences gut peptide production, including ghrelin, glucagon like pepetide-1 (GLP-1), serotonin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), thereby modulating nutrient absorption and immune responses. Gut hormones such as ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), serotonin (5-HT), neurotensin, peptide YY (PYY) and melatonin play key roles in the GBA. These hormones play several roles including modulation of appetite and satiety, metabolism of nutrients such as lipid and glucose, insulin and glucagon secretion, and influence on gut inflammation, mood, learning and cognition. The interaction between gut microbiota and these hormones underscores their role in maintaining gut-brain homeostasis. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, is linked to altered stress responses, anxiety, and depressive behaviors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of microbiota modulation. Despite the significant roles of gut hormones and microbiota in the GBA, literature on their cellular and molecular mechanisms is limited, and often based on animal models. This review synthesizes current understanding of hormones secreted by the intestine, their physiological effects and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action underlying these effects, with a focus on their roles in the GBA.

A total of 70.6% (MarketScan) and 81.0% (Optum CDM) of individuals had at least one obesity-related complication, with the most prevalent being hypertension, dyslipidemia, and pre-diabetes. There were 8709 individuals in the MarketScan database and 3384 in the Optum CDM database with â¥6 months of follow-up. In both databases, approximately two-thirds of people were started on 2.5 mg and, by the sixth prescription fill, the most common doses of Tirzepatide were 5 mg and 7.5 mg. Tirzepatide persistence ranged from 60.6% to 75.7% across both databases, with an allowed gap between prescriptions of 45 days or 60 days. Of individuals who discontinued tirzepatide, 10.2-19.5% restarted Tirzepatide during the 6-month follow-up. In both databases, most people initiating Tirzepatide without T2D diagnoses had â¥1 obesity-related complication, indicating that Tirzepatide is being used in people with multimorbidity. A high proportion of people who initiated Tirzepatide were persistent on treatment at 6 months, which is higher than that previously reported for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.", "entities": [{"entity": "TYPE 2 DIABETES", "start": 96, "end": 110, "matched_text": "TYPE 2 DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CDM", "start": 258, "end": 260, "matched_text": "CDM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CLAIM", "start": 312, "end": 316, "matched_text": "CLAIM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 352, "end": 354, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 813, "end": 816, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 1280, "end": 1286, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 1280, "end": 1286, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 1340, "end": 1351, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 1340, "end": 1351, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DYSLIPIDEMIA", "start": 1354, "end": 1365, "matched_text": "DYSLIPIDEMIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DYSLIPIDEMIA", "start": 1354, "end": 1365, "matched_text": "DYSLIPIDEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DIABETES", "start": 1376, "end": 1383, "matched_text": "DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GAP", "start": 1770, "end": 1772, "matched_text": "GAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "2-19", "start": 1867, "end": 1870, "matched_text": "2-19", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PEPTIDE", "start": 2275, "end": 2281, "matched_text": "PEPTIDE", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are antihyperglycemic agents used to control type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recently, there has been increased recognition of the potential pulmonary protective effects of GLP-1RA. Given the bidirectional association between T2DM and obstructive lung disease (OLD) incidence and progression, our systematic review aimed to determine if GLP-1RA therapy for comorbid T2DM was associated with a decreased risk of asthma and COPD exacerbations, relative to other T2DM treatments. We systematically searched for English-language articles published in Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases from inception to June 25, 2024. Random effects meta-analysis was used to aggregate data where feasible. Of 23 full-text manuscripts considered for inclusion, six retrospective observational studies were selected (total N=62,678). The pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) of asthma or COPD exacerbations demonstrated a statistically significant lower risk of exacerbations associated with GLP-1RA compared to sulfonylureas (IRR, 95%CI: 0.52, 0.42-0.64) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4I) (IRR 0.63, 0.47-0.86), but not sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) (IRR 0.66, 0.21-2.05). The risk of exacerbations rate was also lower in GLP-1RA users relative to insulin in a single study (IRR 0.39, 0.26-0.58) and higher compared to metformin in a single Japanese cohort (IRR 1.24, 1.08-1.43). Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence for a reduced risk for asthma and COPD exacerbations associated with GLP-1RA use in adults with OLD and T2DM, relative to sulfonylureas or DPP-4I medications.

{"text": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are highly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor agonists can improve cognitive function through brain activation in patients with T2DM, compared to other oral glucose-lowering drugs. Mazdutide, a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR), has been shown to simultaneously reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and other comorbidities associated with obesity in patients with T2DM. While its insulinotropic and glucose-lowering effects through the GLP-1 pathway are well-established, mazdutide may also enhance energy expenditure via activation of the GCGR pathway. However, its potential impact on cognitive function remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of mazdutide on cognitive behaviour and cerebral pathology in male db/db mice, a model of T2DM, in comparison to dulaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. All animal findings are applicable to male mice only. Behavioural tests were conducted to evaluate cognitive function, and pathological analyses were performed to assess neurodegenerative markers in the brain. Furthermore, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomics analyses were employed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of mazdutide's effects. Compared to dulaglutide, mazdutide significantly improved cognitive performance in db/db mice, as evidenced by comprehensive behavioural tests. Pathological assessments revealed improvements in neuronal structure and brain tissue integrity in the mazdutide-treated group. Multi-omics analyses further identified distinct molecular pathways involved in neuroprotection, energy metabolism, and synaptic plasticity, suggesting that dual GLP-1/GCGR activation contributes to enhanced cognitive resilience. Our findings indicate that mazdutide, via its dual GLP-1/GCGR activation effects, exerts multifactorial improvements in cognitive function in the context of obesity and T2DM. These results suggest that mazdutide is a promising therapeutic option for mitigating cognitive deficits associated with metabolic disorders.

We used two animal models: the rat, which is commonly studied, and the pig, which shares greater physiological similarities with humans. This study assessed the expression and secretion of insulin and glucagon, the expression of their receptors, cell viability, and cell death following MOTS-c treatment of the islets. Additionally, we examined how MOTS-c secretion is affected by different incubation media, such as the presence of free fatty acids, pancreatic hormones, and different glucose concentrations. The results indicate that MOTS-c impacts pancreatic islet physiology by, for example, reducing insulin and glucagon secretion and enhancing cell viability. Notably, the effects differed between the two species, which may be attributed to anatomical differences in their pancreatic islets or structural variations in rat and pig MOTS-c.

We conducted a propensity score-matched cohort retrospective study by using data obtained from the TriNetX platform. The Global Collaborative Network of TriNetX includes approximately 131 million patients from 109 health care organisations.

{"text": "BackgroundStructural imaging offers insight into migraine pathogenesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry plays a crucial role in identifying these alterations, yet the clinical significance remains debated. While gray matter volume and cortical curvature are commonly analyzed, cortical thickness offers a more direct measure of cytoarchitectural differences and neuroplastic changes in migraine. Advanced structural MRI techniques, including surface-based morphometry and voxel-based morphometry, have provided insights into cortical thickness alterations in migraine. These methods enable high-resolution assessment of brain morphometry, revealing dynamic changes associated with migraine phases and treatment.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes findings from cortical thickness studies, focusing on methodological approaches, variations in imaging sequences and study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.ResultsStudies using surface-based morphometry (i.e. SBM) and voxel-based morphometry (i.e. VBM) have reported inconsistent findings. Increased thickness is frequently observed in pain-processing regions, such as the somatosensory cortex, insula and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting hyperexcitability or maladaptive neuroplasticity. by contrast, cortical thinning has been noted in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and visual cortex, suggesting neuronal loss or impaired cortical integrity. Differences between episodic and chronic migraine further highlight progressive structural changes associated with disease burden. Emerging evidence also suggests that preventive treatments, including calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies and botulinum toxin A, may reverse some of these cortical alterations, particularly in treatment responders.ConclusionsCortical thickness analysis provides valuable insights into migraine pathophysiology, offering a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response.

{"text": "Reinnervation is of great significance for bone regeneration and remodeling. Although great progress has been made in bone tissue engineering, reconstruction of neural networks is still a challenge and leads to limited osteogenesis. Nerve growth factor (NGF) guides the innervation in the early stage of bone healing, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are continuously expressed during the bone healing process that can induce osteogenic differentiation. A microsphere-hydrogel scaffold mimicking the dynamic performance of NGF and BMPs in a timely manner is designed and constructed via 3D printing. The scaffold enables rapid release of NGF mimetic peptide and long-lasting sustained release of BMP-2 mimetic peptide, which aims at restoring innervation. The rapid release of NGF mimetic peptide could significantly promote migration of RSC96 and axon elongation of pheochromocytoma cells in vitro. Meanwhile, co-delivery of NGF/BMP-2 mimetic peptides could synergistically enhance osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-dependent signaling pathway. Moreover, the scaffold accelerates neural network reconstruction and effectively improves new bone regeneration in vivo. In conclusion, this 3D printed microsphere-hydrogel scaffold could simulate the temporal release profile of natural growth factors, and provide a promising strategy for innervated bone regeneration.", "entities": [{"entity": "BONE REGENERATION", "start": 44, "end": 60, "matched_text": "BONE REGENERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BONE TISSUE", "start": 119, "end": 129, "matched_text": "BONE TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "OSTEOGENESIS", "start": 220, "end": 231, "matched_text": "OSTEOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NERVE", "start": 234, "end": 238, "matched_text": "NERVE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NGF", "start": 255, "end": 257, "matched_text": "NGF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INNERVATION", "start": 271, "end": 281, "matched_text": "INNERVATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BMPS", "start": 352, "end": 355, "matched_text": "BMPS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROCESS", "start": 409, "end": 415, "matched_text": "PROCESS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PEPTIDE", "start": 657, "end": 663, "matched_text": "PEPTIDE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BMP-2", "start": 703, "end": 707, "matched_text": "BMP-2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 732, "end": 735, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AXON", "start": 855, "end": 858, "matched_text": "AXON", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA", "start": 874, "end": 889, "matched_text": "PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA", "start": 874, "end": 889, "matched_text": "PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BONE MARROW", "start": 1020, "end": 1030, "matched_text": "BONE MARROW", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1078, "end": 1081, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 1078, "end": 1081, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CGRP", "start": 1100, "end": 1103, "matched_text": "CGRP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "start": 1116, "end": 1132, "matched_text": "SIGNALING PATHWAY", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide involved in neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation, playing a key role in the pathophysiology of both migraines and inflammatory skin conditions, including acne and rosacea. This case report presents a 30-year-old woman with a long-standing history of cystic acne, which persisted despite numerous treatments, including antibiotics and hormonal therapy for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The patient was prescribed rimegepant, a CGRP receptor antagonist, for migraine management. Within four weeks of starting rimegepant, the patient experienced significant improvement in her cystic acne, particularly on her chin, which had been the most affected area. The painful lesions cleared almost entirely, and the patient reported a reduction in both cosmetic and physical discomfort. The cystic acne did not recur, except for a minor episode during a period of high stress. This case suggests that CGRP inhibition may have potential therapeutic benefits for inflammatory skin conditions such as cystic acne. The mechanism may involve modulation of neurogenic inflammation, which plays a role in the development of acne. CGRP's involvement in sebaceous gland activity and its inflammatory effects make it a promising target for acne treatment. Further studies are needed to explore the potential dermatological applications of CGRP antagonists like rimegepant in patients with acne and other inflammatory skin disorders. This case contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that CGRP inhibitors could offer benefits beyond migraine treatment, highlighting a novel therapeutic avenue for skin health management.

As such, migraine involves integration of sensory, pain, cognitive, autonomic, and affect-related circuits. It is essential to understand how neural activity across various brain regions is coordinated during migraine pathophysiology. Using a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mouse model of migraine, we probed neural oscillatory activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMY), thalamus (Po, VPM, and MDthal), and parabrachial nucleus (PBN) following peripheral administration of CGRP. We found that power across the network was lowered within 10 minutes of peripheral CGRP exposure, which was sustained for â¼40-50 min. Coherence was mostly disrupted in amygdalar brain region pairings, and took on a shorter timecourse. Sumatriptan partially reversed these CGRP-induced network responses. Early life stress, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of migraine in adulthood in humans, exacerbated CGRP-induced migraine-related behavioral and network physiology phenotypes. Clustering based on a changepoint analysis of coherence identified individual mice hypersusceptible to migraine.

Protocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered â¥6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity. Immune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection.

{"text": "Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) induced acute kidney injury (AKI) features increased renal vascular resistance, which is predominantly regulated by adjustments in afferent arteriolar diameter. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, is a potent vasoconstrictor in afferent arterioles. We hypothesized that IR enhanced afferent arteriolar sensitivity to S1P-induced vasoconstriction, thus contributing to renal microvascular dysfunction and kidney injury in AKI. The impact of IR on afferent arteriolar reactivity to S1P was assessed using the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation in male rats subjected to 60 minutes of bilateral renal arterial ischemia followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Baseline diameter of afferent arterioles declined significantly following IR. S1P evoked concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in both sham and IR rats. However, the S1P concentration-response curve left-shifted after IR and its EC50 reduced by 8-fold (P < 0.05), suggesting enhanced afferent arteriolar reactivity to S1P. S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) blockade with JTE-013 increased arteriolar diameter by 38 Â± 7% following IR contrasted to a 9 Â± 3% increase in sham rats (P < 0.05), indicating that endogenous S1P exerts a significant impact on afferent arteriolar tone after IR. Furthermore, IR upregulated mRNA and protein of S1PR2 in isolated preglomerular microvessels and elevated S1P content in kidney homogenates.

{"text": "Red yeasts demonstrate considerable potential in industrial and biotechnological applications, particularly in the biosynthesis of carotenoids and lipids, which are valuable secondary metabolites with a wide range of applications. In the oleaginous red yeast Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae YM25235, the acetyl-CoA synthetases RkACS1 and RkACS2 play critical roles in converting acetate into acetyl-CoA, a key precursor for the synthesis of various metabolites, including carotenoids and lipids. This study explores the physiological functions and metabolic regulation of RkACS1 and RkACS2, revealing distinct roles for these isoenzymes in metabolic processes. RkACS1 is essential for utilizing non-fermentable carbon sources such as acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, exhibiting high affinity for acetate and being activated by acetate while inhibited by glucose. Additionally, RkACS1 is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. In contrast, RkACS2, while not specific to particular carbon sources, is primarily involved in lipid and fatty acid synthesis. It also influences gene expression through histone acetylation in the nucleus. Notably, these two isoenzymes exhibit functional redundancy and mutual regulation. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic regulation of acetyl-CoA synthesis, offering a foundation for engineering strategies aimed at optimizing secondary metabolite production in oleaginous red yeasts.

{"text": "The organization and dynamics of chromatin play a fundamental role in transcriptional regulation. In higher eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is wrapped around histones to form nucleosomes, which are irregularly folded into condensed chromatin domains ranging from euchromatin to heterochromatin. These domains have distinct functions and physical differences that impact chromatin accessibility. Recently, replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling was developed to specifically mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this technique, nucleosome behavior was revealed across four chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin. Interestingly, nucleosome motion is progressively constrained along this spectrum. Nucleosomes in euchromatin domains fluctuate more like a liquid, whereas those in heterochromatin are highly constrained, resembling a gel-like state. How these physical properties relate to DNA/chromatin accessibility and genome function remains an important question.

{"text": "Obesity and related metabolic disorders represent a significant global health challenge. A promising therapeutic avenue involves fat browning, the conversion of energy-storing white adipose tissue (WAT) into thermogenic beige fat, which dissipates energy as heat. Since brown fat dissipates more energy than white fat it is commonly characterized by increased mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of thermogenic genes to enhance energy expenditure. Although fat browning can have different mechanisms, this review focusses on epigenetic mechanisms that underline browning of fat. These epigenetic mechanisms comprise DNA methylation (DNMTs), histone modifications (HDACs, H3K27Me3) and non-coding RNA (miR133, miR26, miR34a) mediated regulation. These epigenetic mechanisms in turn are triggered by diet and exercise, environmental factors such as temperature, obesity and comorbidities such as diabetes and blood pressure. The triggered epigenetic mechanisms in turn trigger genes such as UCP1 which are associated with thermogenesis in adipocytes and hence fat browning. Brown/white fat communicate with neighbouring organs such as liver, heart, kidneys and blood vessels providing protective environment.

{"text": "Reduced seed shattering is a key goal in crop domestication and improvement. Seed shattering 1 (Sh1) was parallel selected during the domestication of the Poaceae family. Investigating the regulatory network of OsSh1 in controlling seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.) offers biological insights and potential for agricultural applications. Here, we identified a transcription factor of CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, and TOC1(CCT) family, OsCCT22, that physically interacts with OsSh1 in rice. oscct22 mutants exhibited a phenotype similar to ossh1 mutants, characterized by incomplete development of abscission layers and reduced seed shattering ability. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that OsSh1 and OsCCT22 jointly regulate the expression of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Notably, transcription of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) gene OsCAD2, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT), and O-methyltransferase 16 (ROMT-16) was directly inhibited by OsSh1 binding to their key binding motif. This repression was enhanced by the interaction between OsCCT22 and OsSh1. Additionally, our study suggests that OsSh1 regulates the transcription of OsCAD2 by modulating histone methylation modifications near the first intron. Loss-of-function mutations in OsCAD2 led to the formation of more extensive abscission layers and a significant reduction in lignin deposition, resulting in natural seed shattering. Our findings reveal that the OsCCT22-OsSh1-OsCAD2 module affects the lignin deposition of the abscission zone and seed shattering in rice and provide a target for the genetic improvement of seed shattering in crop breeding.", "entities": [{"entity": "KEY", "start": 30, "end": 32, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CROP", "start": 42, "end": 45, "matched_text": "CROP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POACEAE", "start": 156, "end": 162, "matched_text": "POACEAE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "start": 369, "end": 388, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TOC1", "start": 422, "end": 425, "matched_text": "TOC1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CCT", "start": 427, "end": 429, "matched_text": "CCT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PHENOTYPE", "start": 523, "end": 531, "matched_text": "PHENOTYPE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ABSCISSION", "start": 602, "end": 611, "matched_text": "ABSCISSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIGNIN BIOSYNTHESIS", "start": 766, "end": 784, "matched_text": "LIGNIN BIOSYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 796, "end": 808, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ALCOHOL", "start": 826, "end": 832, "matched_text": "ALCOHOL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CAD", "start": 849, "end": 851, "matched_text": "CAD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 854, "end": 857, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 854, "end": 857, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BINDING", "start": 979, "end": 985, "matched_text": "BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HISTONE", "start": 1186, "end": 1192, "matched_text": "HISTONE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "METHYLATION", "start": 1194, "end": 1204, "matched_text": "METHYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 1291, "end": 1299, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}]}

{"text": "Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) has two cleavage sites for activation by coagulation proteases (Arg41 and Arg46). The cleavage of Arg46 by either activated protein C (APC) or thrombin leads to cytoprotective signaling, however, neither protease can cleave this site in the absence of their receptors, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and thrombomodulin (TM), respectively. Arg41 is the preferred cleavage site for both proteases in the absence of receptors. The mechanism by which these receptors function as cofactors to catalyze the cleavage of PAR1-R46 by coagulation proteases is not known. Here, we hypothesized that both receptors alleviate inhibitory interactions of the P2-Leu45 residue on the extracellular domain of PAR1 with protease catalytic pockets. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a PAR1-R41A mutant in which P2-Leu45 of the receptor was substituted with a Pro. Both PAR1-R41A and PAR1-R41A-L45P constructs were transfected to PAR1-knockout EA.hy926 endothelial cells lacking or expressing EPCR or TM followed by monitoring the protease activation of receptors by signaling assays. Furthermore, wildtype or EPCR and TM expressing HEK-293 cells were transfected with PAR1 cleavage reporter constructs carrying N-terminal NanoLuc luciferase and C-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein tags. Signaling and receptor cleavage assays indicated that both APC and thrombin cleave Arg46 in cells expressing PAR1-R41A-L45P, but not PAR1-41A, independent of their receptors. The catalytic activity of thrombin was >10-fold faster than APC in both assays.

In contrast, platelet function, natural anticoagulants, and other coagulation markers did not differ. Our results indicate that the prothrombotic state in nephrotic syndrome is driven by excessive thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis rather than increased platelet aggregation.

{"text": "Many patients suffer from venous thromboembolism (VTE) and its consequences. Despite substantial advancements with the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), patients and clinicians still encounter challenges in the acute and long-term management of VTE, such as recurrent events, anticoagulant-related bleeding complications, and post-thrombotic symptoms. Additionally, certain patient populations, including those with advanced kidney failure and liver cirrhosis and elderly individuals, were excluded from phase 3 clinical DOAC trials. Therefore, the call for innovative anticoagulants in the acute and long-term management of VTE resonates, not only to mitigate long-term recurrences and post-thrombotic symptoms but also to maintain the delicate harmony of hemostasis. Novel targets within the coagulation and fibrinolytic system, as well as mechanisms governing adherence to the vessel wall, are currently being explored to address these unmet needs. First, factor XI inhibitors have shown promise in preclinical and phase 2 clinical studies to tackle thrombosis while preserving hemostasis, although phase 3 trials are required for confirmation. Next, there is interest to boost the endogenous fibrinolytic system, with Î±2-antiplasmin, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 emerging as potential attractive targets.

Although thrombin is a widely used hemostatic agent, its efficacy is limited in the harsh environment of the digestive tract, especially in patients with chronic liver disease or coagulation disorders. Current treatment techniques often fall short, particularly when faced with severe blood loss and coagulation challenges. Here, a novel solution: waxberry-inspired smart nanogels that offer a cost-effective, highly efficient, and mechanically stable approach for local hemostasis is presented. Drawing inspiration from the microfibrous structures of waxberry, a waxberry-like nano-silica with a radially fibrous structure is synthesized for effective thrombin loading and release upon emergency. This nano-silica, coated with GelMA, forms a stable nanogel network activated by blue laser during endoscopy. Within just 5 s, the nanogel effectively triggers coagulation, even in patients with coagulation disorders. The formed blood clots are stable enough to withstand the challenging conditions of the digestive tract, preventing secondary bleeding. Upon injection, thrombin rapidly converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a secondary network that reinforces clot stability.

{"text": "BACKGROUND Injury to the inferior epigastric artery is a major complication of abdominal puncture, and continuous active bleeding from this artery can lead to hemorrhagic shock. Several studies have reported the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to diagnose active bleeding in parenchymal organs. Fluid gelatin is a new hemostatic material that can be injected into the bleeding site by using a puncture needle under the precise guidance of CEUS, which enables the implementation of local minimally invasive and appropriate hemostatic treatment. Here, we report the case of a patient in whom CEUS was used to accurately locate the bleeding site before surgery and guide local injection of fluid gelatin with a puncture needle to successfully achieve nonsurgical treatment of hemostasis. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old man with post-hepatitis B cirrhosis underwent a successful liver transplant surgery. After surgery, abdominal puncture and drainage were performed because of a large amount of peritoneal effusion due to nephrotic syndrome. The drainage fluid was bright red bloody liquid. CEUS revealed many contrast agent microbubbles extravasating from the inferior epigastric artery into peritoneal effusion along the abdominal puncture tract. Surgical suturing and applying a compression bandage failed to achieve satisfactory results. After receiving the patient's consent, thrombin and hemostatic glue were injected locally under the guidance of CEUS. Finally, hemostasis was successfully achieved.

{"text": "Thrombosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Despite the availability of anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, their clinical use is often limited by adverse effects. Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE), a traditional herbal medicine, has shown promise in alleviating thrombosis, but its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to explore the antithrombotic effects and molecular mechanisms of GbE through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments. Online databases were utilized for identifying the GbE's active components and target genes, accompanied by thrombosis-related targets. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were performed. A drug-active component-target gene-signaling pathway network and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed to determine core target genes and pathways. In vivo, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) model was established by ligating the inferior vena cava in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was adopted for evaluating the vascular endothelial structure. The levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), nitric oxide (NO), and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured, accompanied by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the PI3K/AKT pathway-related protein expression. GbE comprised 27 active components with 4727 target genes and 2462 thrombosis-related targets, with 974 shared targets, including AKT1, ALB, GAPDH, TNF, and IL6, enriched in PI3K-AKT and AGE-RAGE pathways. Molecular docking indicated strong binding of GbE's main components to core targets. In vivo, GbE significantly relieved vascular lesions of DVT rats; reduced thrombotic wet weight; increased NO, cGMP, and PGI2 levels; decreased FIB; and prolonged APTT, PT, and TT (P < 0.05). Additionally, Western blot highlighted the suppressed p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios in DVT rats. GbE alleviates thrombosis by increasing antithrombotic factors and reducing coagulation, potentially via downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling.

A previously developed multisensory impairment score (0-12) was calculated based on sample quartiles and summed across sensory domains. Regression models evaluated the associations of inflammation markers with individual and multiple sensory impairments (as separate outcomes) with adjustment for demographics, health conditions, and health behaviors. Higher CRP (Ã = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.12; p = 0.01) and IL-6 (Ã = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.04-0.18; p = 0.003) levels were associated with the number of sensory impairments. Participants with the highest quartile of IL-6 (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.09-1.92; p = 0.01) and TNF-Î± (OR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12-1.91; p = 0.005) had higher odds of a poor multisensory impairment score. High CRP was associated with impaired vision (OR = 1.45; 95% CI:1.08-1.93; p = 0.01) and high TNF-Î± was associated with touch impairment (OR = 1.63; 95% CI:1.15-2.30; p = 0.006). Having multiple high markers was also associated with multisensory (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.20-2.58; p = 0.004) and vision impairment (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.13-2.13; p = 0.004).

However, few studies on IL6R inhibition for relieving chronic low back pain (CLBP) have been conducted. These existing studies are plagued by issues such as small sample sizes and inconsistent inclusion criteria. With advances in genomics, more and more evidence is revealing the role of heritability in the etiology of disease, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses are being used more broadly to infer causation. MR analysis was used in the present study to investigate the effect of IL6R inhibitors on CLBP. IL6R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Europe were selected from online databases. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were utilized as an exposure factor, RA was employed as a positive control, and two CLBP-related genome-wide association studies (GAWS) data were used as primary outcomes for drug-targeted MR analyses for examining causality between IL6R inhibitors and CLBP. In addition, repeated analyses were also performed using different GWAS data related to exposure to test the stability of the results.

The experimental group was divided into mild MPP group (n=70 ) and severe MPP group (n=50 ) according to the severity of the disease. According to the condition after one course of treatment, separated MPP children into good prognosis group (n=96) and poor prognosis group (n=24). The IL-6 and PCT levels of the experimental/control group before treatment and the good/bad prognosis group after treatment were compared, respectively. The lung function of children with MPP before and after treatment was also examined, and the changes of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), expiratory time (Te), peak time (TPTEF), and peak volume (VPTEF) were observed. The correlation between pulmonary function and IL-6, PCT in MPP children was analyzed by Pearson analysis. Receiver operation curve was adopted to analyze the predictive value of IL-6, PCT for poor prognosis. IL-6 and PCT were increased in the severe MPP group compared to the mild MPP group (P<0.001) and tended to decrease in the good prognosis group compared to the poor prognosis group (P<0.001). Fifty-nine of the 70 cases in the good prognosis group were patients with mild MPP, suggesting that patients with mild MPP have a better prognosis. The results of respiratory function showed an increase in RR (P<0.001) and a decrease in VT (P=0.007), TPTEF/Te (P<0.001), VPTEF/VT (P<0.001) in the severe MPP group compared to the mild MPP group. The results of correlation analysis revealed that IL-6, PCT were negatively correlated with VT, TPTEF/Te and VPTEF/VT (P<0.001). ROC curve analysis revealed that IL-6 and PCT co-diagnosis had a better predictive ability for poor prognosis in children with MPP (AUC=0.843).

{"text": "Shashen Maidong Decoction (SSMDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula used for treating chronic bronchitis (CB). This study aims to explore the mechanism of SSMDD against CB, focusing on its active components and their impact on Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a key inflammatory factor. Network pharmacology, a method that helps identify potential active components and their interactions in a biological network, was used to predict SSMDD's effects. Molecular docking, a computational approach for predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target proteins, was utilized to elucidate the mechanisms of action. Transcriptomic analysis, ELISA, and western blot assays were subsequently implemented for mechanism validation. Network pharmacology analysis identified quercetin and kaempferol as key active components of SSMDD, with a high affinity for IL-6. Transcriptomic data confirmed the regulation of inflammation-related pathways by SSMDD, aligning with the predicted targets. In the ELISA determination, compared with the model group, the IL-6 levels in the samples treated with quercetin and kaempferol were reduced by 55% and 36%, respectively. The western blot results showed that the expression of IL-6 protein in these samples decreased by 33% and 25%, respectively. SSMDD exhibits anti-inflammatory activity against CB by targeting IL-6. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which SSMDD exerts its therapeutic effects on CB. Moreover, these findings also suggest that SSMDD may offer insights for future treatments of other inflammatory diseases, potentially improving patient outcomes and developing novel therapeutic strategies.

This was a case series study. Reviewed were consecutive biopsy-proven B-cell VRL cases of which adequate paired AqH and VH samples were obtained for the measurement of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The correlations of IL-10 and IL-6 between AqH and VH were analyzed. Influences of clinical manifestations on IL levels and positive rates of IL-related parameters in AqH and VH were evaluated, which included AqH IL-10 > 30 pg/mL, VH IL-10 > 65 pg/mL, IL-10/IL-6 ratio > 1, and Interleukin Score for Intraocular Lymphoma Diagnosis (ISOLD) > 0 in both the AqH and VH. Seventy-four eyes of 64 patients with VRL were included. IL-10 in VH was significantly higher than in AqH (median: 1159.77 vs. 225.74 pg/mL, P < 0.001). For both IL-10 and IL-6, the AqH concentrations were positively correlated with VH concentrations in the form of power functions (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively).

The humanized sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, can significantly increase bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with osteoporosis, but it may also increase cardiovascular adverse events, particularly in male patients. We try to investigate the effects of novel aptamers targeting the sclerostin loop3 on the skeleton and muscle of orchiectomized (ORX) mice. After 12 weeks of ORX surgery, mice were randomly assigned to receive treatment with sclerostin aptamers (Apc001OA or Apc001OA-d6), alendronate (ALN), teriparatide (PTH 1-34) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After 12 weeks of treatment, skeletal and muscle properties and safety indicators were evaluated in detail. Treatment with Apc001OA and Apc001OA-d6 significantly increased trabecular BMD at the femur by +11.9% and +17.1%, improved parameters of bone microarchitecture (BV/TV by +84.5% and +106.8%), bone strength (maximum load by +30.5% and +31.6%) and bone histological properties (all p < 0.05 vs. PBS group). The therapeutic effects were similar among Apc001OA, Apc001OA-d6, ALN and PTH 1-34 groups (all p > 0.05). After treatment with Apc001OA or Apc001OA-d6, serum sclerostin levels significantly decreased by 25.0% and 24.9% (p < 0.05 vs. PBS group). The expression levels of key genes in the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, Ctnnb1 and Lef1 significantly increased by 2.4- and 3.4-fold in the Apc001OA group and by 2.5- and 3.5-fold in the Apc001OA-d6 group (p < 0.05 vs. PBS group), indicating that the aptamers improved bone properties through activating Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Apc001OA and Apc001OA-d6 significantly improved rotarod latency (p < 0.05 vs. PBS group) of ORX mice, and Apc001OA-d6 could increase forelimb grip strength. Apc001OA, Apc001OA-d6 and PTH 1-34 improved histological properties of muscle in ORX mice. No lesions or pathological changes were observed in the heart, aortic roots, liver, spleen, lungs or kidneys. Immunohistochemistry revealed no abnormal staining of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) in the heart. There was no significant difference in serum concentrations of cardiac functional biomarkers, including creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and TNF-Î±) across all groups, indicating that Apc001OA and Apc001OA-d6 had no adverse cardiovascular effects in ORX mice. The novel aptamers Apc001OA and Apc001OA-d6, targeting sclerostin loop3, could significantly increase BMD and improve bone microarchitecture, bone biomechanics, muscle function and histological properties of muscle and bone in ORX mice, without adverse cardiovascular effects.

{"text": "In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterised by progressive liver damage, inflammation, fibrosis and potential cirrhosis, treatment options are limited, with liver transplantation as the only definitive solution. To address this urgent need, in vitro and tissue engineering studies have explored new drugs. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic potential of Nicotinamide, utilising promising preliminary data for treating NAFLD. Multicellular liver microtissues comprising LX2 stellate cells, HepG2 hepatocytes and HUVECs were generated to establish a robust preclinical model for fibrosis. Cell viability and histological assessments confirmed successful co-aggregation within the microtissues. To induce fibrosis, they were treated with a palmitic and oleic acid mixture, followed by exposure to Nicotinamide. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated by analysing inflammatory factors, including transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 6. Extracellular matrix deposition was assessed by measuring collagen type I (COL I) and Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA). Our data suggested that Nicotinamide application led to significant improvements across several measures. Specifically, it effectively reduced inflammatory response by reducing TGF-Î²1 levels and decreasing COL I and Î±-SMA levels. Furthermore, Nicotinamide was crucial in reducing reactive oxygen species levels, indicating that activation of HSC, inflammatory signals and oxidative stress work together. These in vitro findings suggest Nicotinamide may have therapeutic potential warranting further investigation in advanced preclinical models. Our findings demonstrated significant improvements across various parameters, including reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuated oxidative stress, underscoring the therapeutic potential of Nicotinamide in clinical studies.", "entities": [{"entity": "NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE", "start": 4, "end": 36, "matched_text": "NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROGRESSIVE", "start": 64, "end": 74, "matched_text": "PROGRESSIVE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 76, "end": 80, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 82, "end": 87, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 90, "end": 101, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 90, "end": 101, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CIRRHOSIS", "start": 127, "end": 135, "matched_text": "CIRRHOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CIRRHOSIS", "start": 127, "end": 135, "matched_text": "CIRRHOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 271, "end": 276, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 633, "end": 636, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 633, "end": 636, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MIXTURE", "start": 807, "end": 813, "matched_text": "MIXTURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TUMOUR", "start": 979, "end": 984, "matched_text": "TUMOUR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "NECROSIS", "start": 986, "end": 993, "matched_text": "NECROSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NECROSIS", "start": 986, "end": 993, "matched_text": "NECROSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ALPHA", "start": 1002, "end": 1006, "matched_text": "ALPHA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TNF", "start": 1009, "end": 1011, "matched_text": "TNF", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 1035, "end": 1038, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX", "start": 1059, "end": 1078, "matched_text": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "COLLAGEN", "start": 1117, "end": 1124, "matched_text": "COLLAGEN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "COL", "start": 1134, "end": 1136, "matched_text": "COL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APPLICATION", "start": 1215, "end": 1225, "matched_text": "APPLICATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HSC", "start": 1522, "end": 1524, "matched_text": "HSC", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HSC", "start": 1522, "end": 1524, "matched_text": "HSC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 1552, "end": 1567, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}]}

{"text": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a chronic kidney condition that arises from prolonged hyperglycaemia that can progress to kidney failure, severe morbidity, and mortality if left untreated. It is the major cause of chronic kidney disease among people who have diabetes, accounting for a significant percentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease who require kidney replacement therapy. In DKD, numerous dysbalanced metabolic, haemodynamic, inflammatory signalling pathways, and molecular mediators interconnect, creating a feedback loop that promotes general kidney damage. Hyperglycaemia is the primary trigger for DKD and leads gradually to oxidative stress, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis, glomerular hypertension, and intrarenal hypoxia. Key interconnected metabolic pathways are the hyperglycaemia-mediated polyol, hexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation end-products pathway hyperactivity. Concurrently, hyperglycaemia-induced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulation, alters the kidney intraglomerular haemodynamic leading to inflammation through Toll-like receptors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappa B, transforming growth factor-beta-mediated excessive extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. The resulting death signals trigger apoptosis and autophagy through Hippo, Notch, and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activation and microRNA dysregulation. These signals synergistically remodel the kidneys culminating in intrarenal hypoxia, podocyte dysfunction, hyperfiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and loss of kidney function. The resulting renal failure further upregulates these death pathways and mediators, giving rise to a vicious cycle that further worsens DKD. This review provides an overview of the primary molecular mediators and signalling pathways leading to DKD; their interconnectivity at the onset and during DKD progression, the central role of transforming growth factor-beta via different pathways, the Hippo pathway kidney-specific response to hyperglycaemia, and how all mediators and transduction signals result in a vicious circle that exacerbates renal failure. The review gives therapeutic sights to these pathways as druggable targets for DKD management. Understanding these molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of DKD can bridge basic research and clinical application, facilitating the development of innovative management strategies.", "entities": [{"entity": "KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 10, "end": 23, "matched_text": "KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 10, "end": 23, "matched_text": "KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 36, "end": 42, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KIDNEY", "start": 44, "end": 49, "matched_text": "KIDNEY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROLONGED", "start": 78, "end": 86, "matched_text": "PROLONGED", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KIDNEY FAILURE", "start": 124, "end": 137, "matched_text": "KIDNEY FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 216, "end": 237, "matched_text": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 216, "end": 237, "matched_text": "CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIABETES", "start": 261, "end": 268, "matched_text": "DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "END-STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE", "start": 328, "end": 351, "matched_text": "END-STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "SIGNALLING", "start": 460, "end": 469, "matched_text": "SIGNALLING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "start": 650, "end": 665, "matched_text": "OXIDATIVE STRESS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 668, "end": 679, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 668, "end": 679, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX", "start": 682, "end": 701, "matched_text": "EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 739, "end": 750, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 739, "end": 750, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HYPOXIA", "start": 768, "end": 774, "matched_text": "HYPOXIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 777, "end": 779, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "POLYOL", "start": 847, "end": 852, "matched_text": "POLYOL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN KINASE C", "start": 867, "end": 882, "matched_text": "PROTEIN KINASE C", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "END", "start": 908, "end": 910, "matched_text": "END", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPERACTIVITY", "start": 929, "end": 941, "matched_text": "HYPERACTIVITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERACTIVITY", "start": 929, "end": 941, "matched_text": "HYPERACTIVITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RENIN", "start": 981, "end": 985, "matched_text": "RENIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TOLL", "start": 1110, "end": 1113, "matched_text": "TOLL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "JANUS KINASE", "start": 1131, "end": 1142, "matched_text": "JANUS KINASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNAL", "start": 1144, "end": 1149, "matched_text": "SIGNAL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1179, "end": 1191, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BETA", "start": 1249, "end": 1252, "matched_text": "BETA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "APOPTOSIS", "start": 1357, "end": 1365, "matched_text": "APOPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AUTOPHAGY", "start": 1371, "end": 1379, "matched_text": "AUTOPHAGY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "NOTCH", "start": 1396, "end": 1400, "matched_text": "NOTCH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION", "start": 1593, "end": 1625, "matched_text": "EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "RENAL FAILURE", "start": 1671, "end": 1683, "matched_text": "RENAL FAILURE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RENAL FAILURE", "start": 1671, "end": 1683, "matched_text": "RENAL FAILURE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 1975, "end": 1981, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1983, "end": 1986, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 2113, "end": 2115, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSDUCTION", "start": 2135, "end": 2146, "matched_text": "TRANSDUCTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 2362, "end": 2373, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "APPLICATION", "start": 2421, "end": 2431, "matched_text": "APPLICATION", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Although unilateral adrenal artery embolization (AAE) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), it may be insufficient for treating patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) due to the bilateral nature of their condition. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of alcohol-mediated bilateral adrenal artery embolization (Bi-AAE) in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). A total of 72 patients were randomly assigned in a (1:1) ratio to receive either Bi-AAE or spironolactone (20-60 mg/day). The primary endpoint was the change in office systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 6 months. Key secondary endpoints included changes in 24 h blood pressure, aldosterone levels, aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), and serum potassium. At 6 months, Bi-AAE significantly reduced office SBP compared to spironolactone (-18.9 Â± 16.4 mmHg vs. -11.6 Â± 9.3 mmHg; treatment difference: -7.4 mmHg; P = 0.03), with a greater proportion of Bi-AAE patients achieving target SBP (<140 mmHg; 77.1% vs. 51.5%; P = 0.027). Bi-AAE also resulted in significantly greater reductions in 24 h and home SBP at 1, 3, and 6 months (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, Bi-AAE was more effective in correcting biochemical abnormalities, including hyperaldosteronism and renin suppression (all P < 0.05). Importantly, Bi-AAE preserved zona fasciculata function, as evidenced by normal morning serum cortisol levels and intact responses to ACTH stimulation post-procedure. No serious adverse events occurred during the perioperative or 6-month follow-up period. These findings support Bi-AAE as a safe, minimally invasive, and highly effective alternative to medical therapy for managing IHA. Although the findings support Bi-AAE as a safe, minimally invasive, and highly effective alternative to medical therapy for managing IHA, the need for long-term data before drawing definitive conclusions is emphasized.

However, the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on the risk of AKI in HNC patients undergoing CCRT is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the association between RAAS blockade, AKI and survival in HNC patients undergoing CCRT. This retrospective cohort study included 989 HNC patients treated between January 2016 and July 2022, with follow-up extending to July 2022. Among them, 65 (6.6%) patients were using RAAS blockade for hypertension control, while 924 were non-users. Clinical data and demographics were retrieved. Cox regression models were employed to analyze primary outcomes, including AKI and patient survival. There were 65 (6.6%) patients being RAAS blockade users in the study. The mean age of RAAS blockade users was older than that of non-users (61 vs. 55 years old, p < 0.001). Overall, 219 (22.1%) patients developed AKI, including 25 RAAS blockade users. RAAS blockade users had a higher risk of AKI compared to non-users (38% vs. 21%, p = 0.001) and also had a worse mortality rate (35% vs. 22%, p = 0.015). Factors such as male gender, age, RAAS blockade usage, and baseline serum creatinine levels independently predicted the onset of AKI and patient survival. RAAS blockade users developed AKI, which significantly predicted patient survival. Diligent post-CCRT renal function monitoring and hydration in RAAS blockade users are crucial to mitigate AKI risk and potentially improve survival in this patient group.", "entities": [{"entity": "ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY", "start": 18, "end": 36, "matched_text": "ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEAD AND NECK CANCER", "start": 58, "end": 77, "matched_text": "HEAD AND NECK CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEAD AND NECK CANCER", "start": 58, "end": 77, "matched_text": "HEAD AND NECK CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "RENIN", "start": 180, "end": 184, "matched_text": "RENIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 624, "end": 635, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTENSION", "start": 624, "end": 635, "matched_text": "HYPERTENSION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "POST", "start": 1473, "end": 1476, "matched_text": "POST", "type": "protein"}]}

This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of CSE against PIPN through the modulation of oxidative, inflammatory, and RAS-related signals. CSE was analyzed for its phenolic and flavonoid content and its antioxidant activity. The study involved four experimental groups: Control, CSE (400 mg/kg/day), Paclitaxel (PTX) (2 mg/kg, i.p. on days 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th), and PTX + CSE. Behavioral tests, biochemical analyses, histological evaluations, and molecular docking were conducted to assess the effects of CSE. PTX-induced hyperalgesia, increased nitric oxide, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II, aldosterone, high mobility group box 1 protein, and decreased glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha. It induced spinal cord and sciatic nerve neuron damage, axonal demyelination, and reduced Schwann cells number. CSE administration with PTX improved behavioral responses, reduced oxidative and inflammatory markers, restored antioxidant and RAS signal balance, and preserved nerve tissue structure. Docking showed strong binding of CSE components with NF-ÎºB, MPO, and ACE, suggesting direct inhibitory interactions.

{"text": "The interaction of proteins with surfaces can involve both protein binding and unfolding and has been investigated since the 1960s. Proteins in solution can adsorb onto and denature at both solid-liquid and gas-liquid interfaces, and the spontaneous adsorption of proteins on a nanoparticle (NP) surface to form a corona can be described as a specific case of adsorption at the solid-liquid interface, where the surface curvature also becomes important. While nanoparticles offer a large surface area, they are not the only surface in the sample with which the proteins interact due to the creation of other interfaces in an experimental setup. In this work, we examine the role of the air-water interface in protein denaturation via soft corona studies with citrate-capped gold nanoparticles. Chymotrypsin (ChT) protein in the soft corona was observed to exhibit an inverse relationship between concentration and denaturation, an air-water interface-mediated trend that, without the right control experiments, can be misinterpreted to be caused by protein-NP interactions. We show that any protein denaturation observed comes from the synergistic effect of the air-water interface and agitation and that NPs did not denature ChT in the \"soft corona\" in the absence of these two factors. While the propensity to adsorb and denature at hydrophobic interfaces varies among proteins with different structural properties, it is important to use simplified procedures that minimize interfacial areas other than the nanoparticle surface in corona studies to prevent misattribution of the observed effects.", "entities": [{"entity": "PROTEIN BINDING", "start": 60, "end": 74, "matched_text": "PROTEIN BINDING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GAS", "start": 208, "end": 210, "matched_text": "GAS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GAS", "start": 208, "end": 210, "matched_text": "GAS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GAS", "start": 208, "end": 210, "matched_text": "GAS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LARGE", "start": 483, "end": 487, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 675, "end": 678, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AIR", "start": 687, "end": 689, "matched_text": "AIR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN DENATURATION", "start": 710, "end": 729, "matched_text": "PROTEIN DENATURATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHT", "start": 809, "end": 811, "matched_text": "CHT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 814, "end": 820, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 814, "end": 820, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AGITATION", "start": 1187, "end": 1195, "matched_text": "AGITATION", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "AGITATION", "start": 1187, "end": 1195, "matched_text": "AGITATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "NPS", "start": 1206, "end": 1208, "matched_text": "NPS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DID", "start": 1210, "end": 1212, "matched_text": "DID", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Inflammation is a multifaceted biological response of the immune system against various harmful stimuli, including pathogens (such as bacteria and viruses), cellular damage, toxins, and natural/synthetic irritants. This protective mechanism is essential for eliminating the cause of injury, removing damaged cells, and initiating the repair process. While inflammation is a fundamental component of the body's defense and healing process, its dysregulation can lead to pathological consequences, contributing to various acute and chronic diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, and other systemic complications. Generally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), antihistamines, biologics, and colchicine are used as pharmacological agents in the management of inflammatory diseases. However, these conventional treatments often have limitations, including adverse side effects, long-term toxicity, and drug resistance. In contrast, enzyme-based therapeutics have emerged as a promising alternative due to their high specificity, catalytic efficiency, and ability to modulate inflammatory pathways with reduced side effects. These enzymes function by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting cytokine transcription, degrading circulating cytokines, and blocking cytokine release by targeting exocytosis-related receptors. Additionally, their role in tissue repair and regeneration further enhances their therapeutic potential. Most natural anti-inflammatory enzymes belong to the oxidoreductase class, including catalase and superoxide dismutase, as well as hydrolases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, nattokinase, bromelain, papain, serratiopeptidase, collagenase, hyaluronidase, and lysozyme. Engineered enzymes, such as Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease and botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A), have also demonstrated significant potential in targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. Recent advancements in enzyme engineering, nanotechnology-based enzyme delivery, and biopharmaceutical formulations have further expanded their applicability in treating inflammatory diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of both natural and engineered enzymes, along with their formulations, used as anti-inflammatory therapeutics. It highlights improvements in stability, efficacy, and specificity, as well as minimized immunogenicity, while discussing their mechanisms of action and clinical applications and potential future developments in enzyme-based biomedical therapeutics.", "entities": [{"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1, "end": 12, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 1, "end": 12, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IMMUNE SYSTEM", "start": 59, "end": 71, "matched_text": "IMMUNE SYSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BACTERIA", "start": 135, "end": 142, "matched_text": "BACTERIA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BACTERIA", "start": 135, "end": 142, "matched_text": "BACTERIA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VIRUSES", "start": 148, "end": 154, "matched_text": "VIRUSES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "VIRUSES", "start": 148, "end": 154, "matched_text": "VIRUSES", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 167, "end": 172, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROCESS", "start": 342, "end": 348, "matched_text": "PROCESS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "LEAD", "start": 462, "end": 465, "matched_text": "LEAD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 531, "end": 537, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 579, "end": 584, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 579, "end": 584, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DISEASE", "start": 773, "end": 779, "matched_text": "DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 1043, "end": 1046, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "start": 1062, "end": 1076, "matched_text": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "start": 1062, "end": 1076, "matched_text": "DRUG RESISTANCE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROS", "start": 1346, "end": 1348, "matched_text": "ROS", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION", "start": 1372, "end": 1384, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EXOCYTOSIS", "start": 1463, "end": 1472, "matched_text": "EXOCYTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1513, "end": 1516, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TISSUE", "start": 1521, "end": 1526, "matched_text": "TISSUE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "REGENERATION", "start": 1539, "end": 1550, "matched_text": "REGENERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CATALASE", "start": 1683, "end": 1690, "matched_text": "CATALASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRYPSIN", "start": 1748, "end": 1754, "matched_text": "TRYPSIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BONT", "start": 1959, "end": 1962, "matched_text": "BONT", "type": "gene"}]}

This study aims to computationally construct a human Fv against various emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2 based on IgA sequences from Indonesian COVID-19 survivors. Survivor's saliva and plasma were purified using affinity chromatography to isolate anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA. The IgA components, heavy and light chains, were isolated using SDS-PAGE and confirmed by Western Blot. They were extracted, digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and sequenced using LC MS/MS. Full Fvs were constructed based on IgA sequence obtained and covered with database and reference sequences to generate an Fv Library. The selection of the Fv Library was performed based on modelling, developability, and molecular docking analysis against various RBD variants. The study identified 9 potential Fvs with strong binding affinities to RBD-SARS-CoV-2 across all variants with RMSD values of CDR and Framework of Fv model structures <0.5 Ã and developability scores within the safe therapeutic range. FVIGA0289, one of the top candidates, had binding affinities (ÎG) of -17.5, -16.3, -15.6, -16.6, -17.4, and -17.6 kcal/mol for the Wuhan, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron (XBB.1.5) variants, respectively.

{"text": "During exacerbations, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at risk for severe cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite this, the available literature on systemic biomarkers of CVD during exacerbations is limited. In the present study, a proteomic approach was used to assess alterations in the concentrations of 177 biomarkers of CVD and inflammation in serum samples from 26 long-term smokers (LTS) with mild-to-severe COPD (GOLD stage 1-3) and chronic bronchitis (COPD-CB) but no allergy. These patients were followed for 60 weeks, and they all provided paired samples during stable disease and exacerbations. Serum samples from ten healthy non-smokers (HNS) and ten LTS without COPD or CB constituted controls. Of all the proteins analyzed, only chymotrypsin C (CTRC), oncostatin M (OSM), and matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10) displayed significantly altered concentrations during exacerbations in the COPD-CB group. Here, the concentrations of CTRC and OSM correlated with exacerbation severity, CRP, blood leukocytes, and other cardiovascular biomarkers. In contrast, the concentration of MMP-10 during stable disease correlated with blood eosinophil counts and exacerbation numbers. Finally, the concentrations of OSM and MMP-10 during stable disease correlated with blood leukocytes and tobacco load, respectively. Our study suggests that CTRC, OSM, and MMP-10 bear potential as cardiorespiratory biomarkers in patients with COPD and CB.

{"text": "The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is crucial for sodium absorption in several epithelial tissues including lung and kidney. Its involvement in various renal and pulmonary disorders makes ENaC a potential drug target. High-throughput screening using the automated patch-clamp (APC) technique appears to be a promising approach to discover novel ENaC modulators with (patho-)physiological and therapeutic implications. The aim of this methodological study was to establish APC measurements of ENaC-mediated currents. First, we confirmed functional expression of ENaC in a HEK293 cell line stably transfected with human Î±Î²Î³-ENaC using conventional manual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. For APC measurements, a standard enzymatic cell-detachment procedure was used to prepare single cell suspensions. This resulted in a high success rate of APC recordings with amiloride inhibitable ENaC currents. Using a Î³-inhibitory peptide and the small molecule ENaC activator S3969, we demonstrate that APC recordings could reveal inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on ENaC. Interestingly, the enzymatic cell-detachment protocol resulted in partial proteolytic ENaC activation. The portion of proteolytically activated channels could be reduced by prolonged incubation of suspended cells in cell culture medium. This recovery protocol enhanced the relative stimulatory effect of chymotrypsin, a prototypical serine protease known to cause proteolytic ENaC activation. Thus, this protocol may be particularly useful for identifying novel ENaC activators mimicking proteolytic channel activation.

Mechanistically, SeNPs regulate fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±) pathway.

Taken all, the findings in this study suggest that SeNPs can serve as a novel therapeutic approach for treating MASH via modulating lipid metabolism and ferrous ion homeostasis.", "entities": [{"entity": "METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION-ASSOCIATED STEATOHEPATITIS", "start": 1, "end": 48, "matched_text": "METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION-ASSOCIATED STEATOHEPATITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 72, "end": 78, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LIVER DISEASE", "start": 80, "end": 92, "matched_text": "LIVER DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIVER DISEASE", "start": 80, "end": 92, "matched_text": "LIVER DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "STEATOSIS", "start": 111, "end": 119, "matched_text": "STEATOSIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEPATITIS", "start": 122, "end": 130, "matched_text": "HEPATITIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEPATITIS", "start": 122, "end": 130, "matched_text": "HEPATITIS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 431, "end": 442, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 431, "end": 442, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHOLINE", "start": 471, "end": 477, "matched_text": "CHOLINE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FAT", "start": 517, "end": 519, "matched_text": "FAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRIGLYCERIDE METABOLISM", "start": 583, "end": 605, "matched_text": "TRIGLYCERIDE METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR ALPHA", "start": 619, "end": 666, "matched_text": "PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR ALPHA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PPAR", "start": 669, "end": 672, "matched_text": "PPAR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IRON HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 735, "end": 750, "matched_text": "IRON HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HEME OXYGENASE 1", "start": 782, "end": 797, "matched_text": "HEME OXYGENASE 1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HMOX1", "start": 800, "end": 804, "matched_text": "HMOX1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSFERRIN", "start": 811, "end": 821, "matched_text": "TRANSFERRIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TFRC", "start": 833, "end": 836, "matched_text": "TFRC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IRON", "start": 861, "end": 864, "matched_text": "IRON", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "FERROPTOSIS", "start": 894, "end": 904, "matched_text": "FERROPTOSIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 919, "end": 923, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIPID METABOLISM", "start": 1058, "end": 1073, "matched_text": "LIPID METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ION HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 1087, "end": 1101, "matched_text": "ION HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Background Enhanced metabolic and mitochondrial activity inherent in actively proliferating cancer cells is associated with intracellular redox imbalance that impacts cellular viability. To restore redox homeostasis cancer cells evolve to activate redox protective mechanisms. This differential activation of redox defense pathways compared to normal cells provides a therapeutic window for novel targeted therapies in cancer. Although the heme metabolism emerges as a crucial regulator of redox homeostasis and iron metabolism in cancer cells with frequent alteration in breast cancer, it remains largely unexplored, and no targeted translational approaches have been developed. Heme-regulated redox homeostasis is coordinately maintained through biosynthetic and degradation pathways. As a byproduct of TCA cycle, cytotoxic heme is initially derivatized by heme oxygenases and progressively metabolized to the potent antioxidant bilirubin by two non-redundant biliverdin reductases, BLVRA and BLVRB. BLVRB overexpression has been observed in breast cancers, although its function in breast cancer pathogenesis remains unknown. Methods CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of BLVRB in multiple breast cancer cell lines demonstrated its profound effect on intracellular redox state and cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft models. Integrated proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic studies identified and validated BLVRB-mediated adaptive metabolic responses required for breast cancer cell cytoprotection. Results We have established BLVRB as a requisite component of the pro-survival redox defense mechanism in breast cancer cells. Targeted deletion of BLVRB induces reductive stress, leading to alterations in endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis and lipid composition. These defects impact plasma membrane functionality and endosomal recycling of multiple oncogenic receptors, such as HER2 and transferrin receptors. Conclusions These data collectively identify BLVRB as a novel metabolic target in breast cancer, distinct from other redox-regulating pathways. This study, along with our recent progress in developing novel specific BLVRB inhibitors, offers a unique translational opportunity for targeted therapies in personalized breast cancer medicine.", "entities": [{"entity": "MITOCHONDRIAL", "start": 35, "end": 47, "matched_text": "MITOCHONDRIAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 93, "end": 98, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 93, "end": 98, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INTRACELLULAR", "start": 125, "end": 137, "matched_text": "INTRACELLULAR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IMBALANCE", "start": 145, "end": 153, "matched_text": "IMBALANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 205, "end": 215, "matched_text": "HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HEME METABOLISM", "start": 441, "end": 455, "matched_text": "HEME METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "IRON", "start": 513, "end": 516, "matched_text": "IRON", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 518, "end": 527, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FREQUENT", "start": 550, "end": 557, "matched_text": "FREQUENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 573, "end": 585, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BREAST CANCER", "start": 573, "end": 585, "matched_text": "BREAST CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HEME", "start": 681, "end": 684, "matched_text": "HEME", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEGRADATION", "start": 766, "end": 776, "matched_text": "DEGRADATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TCA CYCLE", "start": 806, "end": 814, "matched_text": "TCA CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BLVRA", "start": 986, "end": 990, "matched_text": "BLVRA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLVRB", "start": 996, "end": 1000, "matched_text": "BLVRB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BREAST", "start": 1045, "end": 1050, "matched_text": "BREAST", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PATHOGENESIS", "start": 1100, "end": 1111, "matched_text": "PATHOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DELETION", "start": 1150, "end": 1157, "matched_text": "DELETION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1194, "end": 1197, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1194, "end": 1197, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROFOUND", "start": 1222, "end": 1229, "matched_text": "PROFOUND", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "start": 1271, "end": 1288, "matched_text": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PRO-SURVIVAL", "start": 1561, "end": 1572, "matched_text": "PRO-SURVIVAL", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "start": 1701, "end": 1721, "matched_text": "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIPID", "start": 1740, "end": 1744, "matched_text": "LIPID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "start": 1780, "end": 1794, "matched_text": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "start": 1780, "end": 1794, "matched_text": "PLASMA MEMBRANE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HER2", "start": 1875, "end": 1878, "matched_text": "HER2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSFERRIN", "start": 1884, "end": 1894, "matched_text": "TRANSFERRIN", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive iron overload disorder. It occurs due to a failure in the hepcidin response, leading to systemic iron overload. The high iron levels in the plasma stored in various organs cause injury and permanent damage. There are two types of hemochromatosis: primary and secondary. In non- HFE hemochromatosis, mutations in the HJV, HAMP, TRF2, and SLC40A1 genes are implicated, with the associated condition classified as type I hemochromatosis. In contrast, juvenile hemochromatosis (type II hemochromatosis/ HFE II) is linked to mutations in the hemojuvelin gene or the antimicrobial peptide hepcidin. In this study, relevant literature in databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE records, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Google Scholar, and Embase, was searched. Our study inclusion criteria encompassed both experimental and observational studies or a combination of both, with data derived from the human population. The exclusion criteria included animal models, observational studies, and unpublished data. Hepcidin is usually up-regulated in response to high serum iron, but it is unexpectedly low in patients with hemochromatosis because of mutations in HFE, hemojuvelin (JH), and transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2). TfR2, expressed by hepatocytes, is mutated in hemochromatosis type III. Future research directions include exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the TFR2 gene variant on iron homeostasis and liver damage and investigating potential therapeutic targets for treating hemochromatosis-related liver disease. Additionally, further epidemiological and modern genetic engineering studies are needed to better understand the prevalence and impact of hemochromatosis on liver health in different populations.", "entities": [{"entity": "HEMOCHROMATOSIS", "start": 1, "end": 15, "matched_text": "HEMOCHROMATOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE", "start": 23, "end": 41, "matched_text": "AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "IRON", "start": 43, "end": 46, "matched_text": "IRON", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HEPCIDIN", "start": 101, "end": 108, "matched_text": "HEPCIDIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PLASMA", "start": 183, "end": 188, "matched_text": "PLASMA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DAMAGE", "start": 242, "end": 247, "matched_text": "DAMAGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HFE", "start": 321, "end": 323, "matched_text": "HFE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HJV", "start": 359, "end": 361, "matched_text": "HJV", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HAMP", "start": 364, "end": 367, "matched_text": "HAMP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRF2", "start": 370, "end": 373, "matched_text": "TRF2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SLC40A1", "start": 380, "end": 386, "matched_text": "SLC40A1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "JUVENILE HEMOCHROMATOSIS", "start": 491, "end": 514, "matched_text": "JUVENILE HEMOCHROMATOSIS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 592, "end": 595, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 592, "end": 595, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE", "start": 604, "end": 624, "matched_text": "ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CENTRAL", "start": 729, "end": 735, "matched_text": "CENTRAL", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TRANSFERRIN", "start": 1244, "end": 1254, "matched_text": "TRANSFERRIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TFR2", "start": 1268, "end": 1271, "matched_text": "TFR2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "IRON HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 1468, "end": 1483, "matched_text": "IRON HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 1489, "end": 1493, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIVER DISEASE", "start": 1587, "end": 1599, "matched_text": "LIVER DISEASE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIVER DISEASE", "start": 1587, "end": 1599, "matched_text": "LIVER DISEASE", "type": "symptom"}]}

{"text": "Colorectal cancer is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal malignancy leading to mortality. The prolonged efficacy of chemotherapeutic medications has been hindered by their limited capacity to reach the intended target, their lack of specificity in targeting tumors, their non-specific dispersion throughout the body and limited availability at the tumor location, and their undesired adverse effects. Targeted drug delivery to the colon enhances drug concentration at the desired location, resulting in a reduced dosage requirement and consequently, fewer side effects. This review article provides a thorough discussion of the numerous pathways that may cause colorectal cancer. The concept of drug targeting in colorectal cancer using nanovesicles has been addressed in detail in this article. This can be accomplished either by passive targeting or active targeting through receptor-ligand interaction by attaching certain active targeting moieties, such as folic acid, epidermal growth factor receptor, GE-11 peptide, EpCAM aptamer, and transferrin, over the surface of nanovesicle. This review showcases applications of nanovesicle systems, such as liposomes, phytosomes, polymeric micelles, niosomes, cubosomes, emulsomes, polymersomes and lipopolymersomes in drug delivery for the management of colorectal cancer.

{"text": "Fucoxanthin (FUC), a carotenoid naturally occurring in marine environments, has demonstrated various nutritional benefits. However, its application in the food industry is limited due to its inherent instability. This study aims to evaluate the ability of two types of lactoferrin (LF)-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) complexes to encapsulate and stabilize FUC. These complexes were formed through physical mixing and enzymatic glycosylation. In the presence of CMCS, fluorescence spectra analysis revealed a static quenching interaction between LF and FUC. Furthermore, at a CMCS concentration of 0.3 wt%, the physical mixture and glycosylated LF exhibited enhanced binding affinity for FUC. FUC was encapsulated in the complexes via the antisolvent method, yielding FUC-loaded composite nanoparticles. FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the successful encapsulation of FUC within the nanoparticles, mediated by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic forces.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Lactoferricin (Lfcin), a cationic AMP located in the N-terminal region of lactoferrin, serves as the antimicrobial active center of the intact protein. The presence of two cysteines in Lfcin allows for the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which may influence its molecular structure and antibacterial function. To investigate this hypothesis, we synthesized, purified, and identified bovine Lfcin along with two derivatives: Lfcin with a disulfide bond (Lfcin DB) and a mutated form that cannot form the disulfide bond (Lfcin C36G). We analyzed the circular dichroism spectra of these peptides under varying ionic and hydrophobic conditions, while their tertiary structures were predicted using AlphaFold3.

This study aimed to elucidate the pathological features of thrombus-associated amyloid deposition by immunohistochemistry combined with proteomic analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with laser microdissection. Our findings revealed that thrombus-associated amyloid deposits within the thrombus and vessel wall primarily comprised apolipoprotein A-I, with a mixture of amyloid fibrils derived from amyloidogenic proteins, including transthyretin and lactoferrin. Given that these proteins are present in the blood, our results support a previous hypothesis that proteins denatured during thrombus aging are a source of amyloid. Furthermore, phagocytes were infiltrated around the intramural and extravascular deposits rather than around the amyloid deposits within the thrombus. Therefore, amyloid deposits generated within the thrombus may be transported from regions with limited blood flow to the vessel wall and surrounding tissues, where blood flow is present, during thrombus processing. These deposits were primarily removed by phagocytic cells. Our results suggest that a facilitative effect on deposition occurs via a cross-seeding mechanism between amyloid fibrils and that phagocytes can remove amyloid deposits.

The study included 114 patients with RA and 42 healthy subjects. Serum concentrations of Trx 1, LF, RF, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, Creactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 were determined using commercially available ELISA kits. Serum thioredoxin 1 levels in RA were significantly higher compared to the control group, 36.4 (29.6-40.2), ng/mL versus 19.0 (16.3-26.8), ng/mL, p<0.0001. Serum lactoferrin levels were elevated in RA compared to the control group. However, the difference was not statistically significant, 579.6 (312.8-947.5) ng/mL versus 519.0 (262.5-928.0) ng/mL.

{"text": "Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (CPs) are rare embryonic tumors originating from the sellar area. Neuroendocrine deficiencies affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axes are well-known but the mechanisms underlying prolactin secretion in CP patients are unclear. This study analyzed the factors associated with prolactin serum concentrations in CP patients. Patients with adamantinomatous CP, diagnosed as children, adolescents or young adults (< 26 years) were included in this study. In 98 cases, serum prolactin concentrations were measured before breakfast after fasting for at least 10 h, using an electrochemiluminescence assay, with concentrations analyzed for associations with diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic parameters. Serum prolactin concentrations were within normal, age- and gender-specific ranges in 39 cases (38%), with decreased concentrations in 22 cases (21%) and elevated concentrations in 37 cases (36%). Factors positively associated with increased prolactin levels were age at CP diagnosis, degree of surgical resection, and suprasellar tumor location. Decreased prolactin levels correlated with irradiation and pituitary deficiencies of thyroid-stimulating hormone and vasopressin. Patients with decreased prolactin concentrations exhibited lower event-free survival. Prolactin concentrations were not associated with functional capacity, tumor volume, calcifications, or anthropometric parameters at diagnosis or at the time of study. Prolactin levels in CP patients are influenced by the impact of the tumor on the hypothalamic-pituitary axes, resulting in either increased or decreased serum concentrations. Prolactin levels could serve as a clinical marker for certain sequelae after CP diagnosis. Patients with abnormal prolactin levels should be monitored for signs of hypothalamic syndrome.

{"text": "As modern endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) becomes increasingly refined, patients with large prolactinomas may seek alternatives to lifelong dopamine agonist (DA) therapy. This may raise interest in reassessing potential treatment paradigms and surgical outcomes, particularly in patients who have had long-standing symptoms and sought a more definitive solution. The objective of this study was to explore the viability of EES in experienced centers as a reliable alternative to managing macroprolactinomas. A multicentric cohort of patients with histologically proven macroprolactinoma treated with EES over 12 years was retrospectively reviewed. Early surgical results and the determinant factors of outcome were analyzed using a multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves. A total of 76 patients with a mean Â± SD age of 42.1 Â± 15.6 years and tumor diameter of 22.7 Â± 12.1 mm was included. Gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 56.6%, with Knosp grade (OR 0.167, CI 0.044-0.633, p = 0.008) and clival invasion (OR 0.119, CI 0.019-0.765, p = 0.025) being the only independent predictors. Short-term remission (52/76 patients [68.4%]) was less frequent in patients with cystic tumors (OR 0.004, CI 0.0001-0.0911, p = 0.04) and was higher in those with intended (OR 36.375, CI 1.627-813.128, p = 0.023) or achieved (OR 32.341, CI 1.487-703.558, p = 0.027) GTR in multivariate analysis. The second half of the learning curve showed early complication rates of 41% versus 16.2% in the first half (p = 0.01). During a mean 47.9 Â± 33 months of follow-up, the permanent complication rate was 6.6% and 3/51 patients (5.9%) had recurrence. Overall 4-year recurrence-free survival was significantly lower in DA-dependent patients (70% vs 100%, p < 0.001). Last follow-up prolactin levels were positively correlated with postoperative day 1 levels (correlation coefficient 0.403, p < 0.001), with final normoprolactinemia rates significantly higher in the GTR group than in the non-GTR group (76.7 vs 45.2%, p = 0.005). DA-resistant/intolerant patients achieved significant prolactin levels reduction (576 to 17 Âµg/L, p < 0.001), with normal prolactin level in 51.1% of patients and long-term remission in 35.6%. The overall long-term DA-free remission rate was 39.3%, with the highest preoperative prolactin level (OR 0.999, CI 0.996-0.998, p = 0.042) being the only independent predictor of failure. Subgroup analysis showed remission rates of 80% versus 23.9% in patients with the highest preoperative prolactin levels < 150 versus â¥ 150 Âµg/L, respectively (p < 0.001). The authors found that modern EES in multidisciplinary centers was a low-morbid option for patients with macroprolactinoma. Remission rates were consistent with those of recent studies with variably sized prolactinomas, and recurrence rates were low. Although not universally definitive for macroprolactinomas, early EES can be offered for patients with the highest preoperative prolactin levels below 150 Âµg/L who are unwilling to receive long-term medication. Radiological criteria alone should not be the sole factor in surgical decision-making.", "entities": [{"entity": "LARGE", "start": 90, "end": 94, "matched_text": "LARGE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MACROPROLACTINOMA", "start": 573, "end": 589, "matched_text": "MACROPROLACTINOMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 862, "end": 866, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "TERM", "start": 1119, "end": 1122, "matched_text": "TERM", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FREQUENT", "start": 1168, "end": 1175, "matched_text": "FREQUENT", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LEARNING", "start": 1432, "end": 1439, "matched_text": "LEARNING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROLACTIN", "start": 1787, "end": 1795, "matched_text": "PROLACTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROLACTIN", "start": 1787, "end": 1795, "matched_text": "PROLACTIN", "type": "protein"}]}

In this Swedish population-based cohort study, we used nationwide registries to identify 3837 patients (2955 [77%] women) with HPL, treated with dopamine agonists (DA), diagnosed between 2006 and 2019, along with 38370 controls matched by age, sex, calendar year and county of residence at first HPL diagnosis. Cancer outcomes (overall and specific types) as registered in the Swedish Cancer Registry, were analyzed using Cox regression, internally stratified by the matching variables and additionally adjusted for diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, alcohol overconsumption, hormone replacement therapy and educational level to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). During a median follow-up time of 6.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.4-9.6), 168 (4.6%) new cases of cancer were identified in patients with HPL and 1608 (4.4%) in the control group (aHR 1.05 [95% CI: 0.89-1.23]).

{"text": "The prevalence of circadian misalignment, particularly social jetlag (SJL), contributes significantly to the epidemic of metabolic disorders. However, the precise impact of SJL on the liver has remained poorly elucidated. The rhythmicity of circulating prolactin (PRL) was evaluated in subjects with SJL and mice under SJL. The causative mechanism of SJL on fatty liver was explored using jetlag model in wild-type and Prl SJL increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), mediated by the disruption of the rhythmicity of serum PRL. In particular, SJL inhibits the rhythmic transcription of PRL in the pituitary, leading to desynchronized PRL levels in circulation. Under jetlag conditions, the rhythmicity of the hepatic PRL signaling pathway was significantly dampened, which resulted in increased lipogenesis via inhibited hepatic mitogen-activated protein kinase/cyclin D1 expressions. Notably, PRL treatment at PRL nadir in jetlagged mice decreased hepatic lipid content and liver injury markers to a greater extent compared with conventional PRL administration. Reprogrammed hepatic PRL signaling pathway with concomitant dysregulated lipid metabolism homeostasis was the causative mechanism of fatty liver under SJL, which was mediated through derailed serum PRL rhythm.

This study aimed to analyze the association between exposure to phthalate mixtures, semen quality, and reproductive hormone concentrations in Japanese men seeking fertility treatment. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 197 Japanese adult males who visited clinics for infertility consultations in 2020 and 2021. Semen samples were collected to measure volume, sperm count, sperm concentration, and motility. Spot urine samples were collected to quantify phthalate monoesters, specifically phthalate diester metabolites, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Serum concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were obtained from clinical records. Three statistical methods-weighted quantile sum regression, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian kernel machine regression-were applied. Urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolite mixtures were positively associated with sperm motility, with monoethyl phthalate being the most important contributor to the observed association. No significant associations were found between phthalate mixtures and semen volume, sperm count, or concentration. These associations were consistent across all three statistical methods. Higher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolite mixtures were associated with lower testosterone and higher prolactin concentrations in serum; however, there were no significant associations between phthalate mixtures or individual phthalate metabolites and estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone concentrations. Higher exposure to phthalate mixtures may be associated with increased sperm motility and serum prolactin and reduced serum testosterone concentrations.

This secondary analysis utilized data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized trial. Healthy participants received a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in random order. Plasma hormone levels of the anterior pituitary (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], prolactin, growth hormone [GH] and their peripheral endocrine glands (cortisol, free thyroxine [fT4], testosterone, estradiol) were measured at baseline and 120 minutes after drug-intake.

{"text": "During the post-partum period, new mothers are vulnerable to mood disorders. In adults, impairments in neurogenesis commonly associate with anxiety and depressive behaviors. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is expressed in the choroid plexus (CP) within the subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche, and global loss of IGF2 leads to increased anxiety. Previously, we have shown that Igf2 expression in CP tissue increases 6-fold during lactation but returns to baseline on suppression of prolactin present in lactation, suggesting it is induced by high levels of prolactin. To gain more insight into the role of prolactin-induced Igf2 expression in the CP, we have measured IGF2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid across reproductive states and developed mice in which Igf2 is conditionally removed from the CP. Using CP-derived IGF2 knockout mouse models, we have measured Prlr expression in CP tissue, SVZ mitogenesis, olfaction, and anxiety-like behavior using an elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark transition test (LDTT). Interestingly, we observed a reduction in Prlr expression in CP tissue in one of our Igf2 knockout mouse models, suggesting Igf2 may also act upstream to regulate Prlr expression in CP tissue. No changes were detected in SVZ proliferation rates between Igf2 knockout and controls. Using a buried food test (BFT), however, we show mice with conditional loss of Igf2 in the CP take longer to find a buried fruit loop as compared to controls, indicating olfaction deficits.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large suprasellar mass with sellar extension, diffusion restriction, and hemorrhagic components. The radiological differential diagnoses included papillary craniopharyngioma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and high-grade glioma. Surgical decompression was performed, and histopathological examination revealed a highly cellular tumor with blastemal, glandular, and rosette-forming components, consistent with pituitary blastoma. Immunohistochemistry showed patchy positivity for OLIG2, synaptophysin, and LIN28A, along with a high Ki-67 proliferation index (~90%). Next-generation sequencing confirmed a pathogenic DICER1 mutation (p.Glu1813Asp, p.Pro817fs), supporting the diagnosis. Unlike most reported cases, which present with Cushing's syndrome or ophthalmoplegia, this patient had an elevated prolactin level, a feature not previously described in pituitary blastoma.

{"text": "Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein (PDX)1 is a major transcription factor for the regulation of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin (SST) expression. PDX1 is phosphorylated by CK2 and inhibition of this kinase results in an increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion. Therefore, we speculated in this study that CK2 also affects SST expression. To test this, we analyzed the effects of the two CK2 inhibitors CX-4945 and SGC as well as of PDX1 overexpression on SST expression and secretion in RIN14B cells by qRT-PCR, luciferase assays, Western blot and ELISA. SST expression and secretion were additionally assessed in isolated murine and human islets exposed to the CK2 inhibitors. Moreover, we determined the expression and secretion of the pancreatic endocrine hormones in CX-4945-treated mice. We found a suppressed SST expression in RIN14B cells due to a methylated SST promoter, which could be abolished by DNA demethylation. Under these conditions, we showed that CK2 inhibition increases SST gene expression and secretion. Additional experiments with overexpression of a CK2-phosphorylation mutant of PDX1 verified that SST expression is regulated by CK2. The exposure of isolated murine and human islets to CX-4945 or SGC as well as the treatment of mice with CX-4945 revealed that CK2 also regulates SST expression under physiological conditions. Taken together, these findings not only demonstrate that CK2 controls SST expression in pancreatic Î´-cells but also emphasize the crucial role of this kinase in regulating the main hormones of the endocrine pancreas.", "entities": [{"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 34, "end": 40, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 34, "end": 40, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "start": 60, "end": 79, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "REGULATION", "start": 89, "end": 98, "matched_text": "REGULATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "INSULIN", "start": 103, "end": 109, "matched_text": "INSULIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SOMATOSTATIN", "start": 125, "end": 136, "matched_text": "SOMATOSTATIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SST", "start": 139, "end": 141, "matched_text": "SST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PDX1", "start": 156, "end": 159, "matched_text": "PDX1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GLUCAGON SECRETION", "start": 262, "end": 279, "matched_text": "GLUCAGON SECRETION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SGC", "start": 435, "end": 437, "matched_text": "SGC", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SECRETION", "start": 495, "end": 503, "matched_text": "SECRETION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 560, "end": 563, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MICE", "start": 808, "end": 811, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DNA DEMETHYLATION", "start": 929, "end": 945, "matched_text": "DNA DEMETHYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GENE EXPRESSION", "start": 1016, "end": 1030, "matched_text": "GENE EXPRESSION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "start": 1099, "end": 1113, "matched_text": "PHOSPHORYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 1512, "end": 1515, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 1550, "end": 1553, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ENDOCRINE PANCREAS", "start": 1571, "end": 1588, "matched_text": "ENDOCRINE PANCREAS", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Delta cells participate in regulating hormone secretion in adjacent alpha- and beta cells and a general assumption is that cells with a shorter distance to the secreting cell receive a higher concentration of the secretory compounds. Isolated islets obtained from donors with type 1 diabetes have a reduced glucagon secretion during low glucose levels, but adding a somatostatin receptor inhibitor increases the glucagon secretion. Despite this, information regarding the delta-cell architecture during diabetes is sparse. The aim of the current study was to determine intra-islet and extra-islet delta-cell architecture in the pancreas during long-standing type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic tissue from nine donors with long-standing type 1 diabetes, six donors with type 2 diabetes, and 13 donors without diabetes were obtained. Sections co-stained for somatostatin, glucagon, and insulin were manually examined. There was an approximately two-fold higher number of alpha cells directly adherent to delta cells in subjects with type 1 diabetes compared with non-diabetic subjects. The delta cells were more peripherally located within the islets of donors with type 1 diabetes. The density of extra-islet single delta cells in the acinar region was more than three-fold higher in type 1 diabetes compared with non-diabetic subjects. No differences in delta-cell architecture could be determined in type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic subjects. In conclusion, the islet delta-cell architecture in human type 1 diabetes is remodelled. The higher number of alpha cells directly adherent to delta cells in type 1 diabetes likely increases the alpha cells' exposure to somatostatin.

A total of 7795 ADEs and 1045 significant preferred terms (PTs) were identified when lanreotide was designed as the 'primary suspected' drug. In addition to common ADEs such as nausea, new ADEs such as urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and nasopharyngitis are also observed. Subgroup analyses showed that there were both commonalities and disparities in signal detection among gender, age, reporter, and dosage groups. The sensitivity analyses, excluding concomitant medications, confirmed the persistence of most positive signals. In addition, the combination drug analysis revealed that certain ADEs may occur with the additional treatment of lanreotide.

Overall, 103 replies from 20 countries were received. A PET facility was available at 96/103 (93.2%) sites, of whom 74 (77.1%) performed PET in patients with brain tumours. Reasons for not performing PET included limited availability of tracers (14/29, 48.3%), high cost (11/29, 37.9%), and PET perceived unnecessary (8/29, 27.6%).

This surround suppression is proposed to reduce the redundancy of encoding large stimuli and support scene segmentation. We find that surround suppression decreases firing rates in mouse primary visual cortex by accelerating the decay of visually-evoked responses and reducing response duration. The rapid decay of visual responses at large sizes is enhanced by increased contrast, reduced by locomotion, and invariant to stimulus orientation, consistent with the engagement of a network mechanism. While fast-spiking interneurons have faster dynamics relative to neighboring pyramidal cells, the dynamics of somatostatin-expressing interneurons are delayed. At the subthreshold level, the rapid decay of visual responses with increasing size is due to a delayed removal of both synaptic excitation and inhibition below baseline levels following visual input. We propose that the delayed activation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons drives a network-wide suppression and accelerates the decay of the visual response.

{"text": "Bovine spastic paresis (BSP) is a progressive neuromuscular disease of unknown origin that causes persistent stiffness of the hind limbs. The symptoms are similar to those of human motor neuron diseases such as primary (PLS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). BSP occurs worldwide in cattle production with an estimated prevalence of <1%. For Germany, this means that around 20,000 Holstein cattle are affected. BSP is generally considered a hereditary disease, but there is no prevention through breeding programs. As a result, BSP not only affects animal welfare but also leads to economic losses in milk and beef production. Here, we used transcriptomics to analyse the brainstem, spinal cord and affected gastrocnemius muscle tissue of eight animals affected by BSP and eight control animals from slaughterhouses to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying BSP. We found that the expression of several genes was significantly different in animals affected by BSP compared to control animals. Specific genes for inhibitory neurons were downregulated in the brainstems of the affected animals, namely CCK (cholecystokinin), NPY (neuropeptide Y), and SST (somatostatin). These inhibitory neurotransmitters influence cerebral movement control, among other processes. Furthermore, OOSP2 (oocyte secreted protein 2) was found to be significantly upregulated in the affected animals in all tissues. This expression could best be explained by the presence of T-follicular-helper cells which, through interleukin 21, can trigger a TH-2-dominated immune response and lead to autoimmune encephalitis. Further cases were sampled for confirmation and we detected cell infiltrates of activated microglia and T-cells in the brainstem using immunohistochemistry.

Neurons expressing both Î²-End and Î±MSH are the first to develop and are initially located in the lateral basal hypothalamus (LBH) as early as day 32-34 of gestation. By day 45 of gestation, these neurons have migrated into the medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) area as their final destination. NPY neurons within the ARH develop later and are first documented at day 44 of fetal life, at which time a cluster of neurons are present within ARH-MBH area. NPY neurons continued to be expressed within the ARH area at all later fetal ages analyzed. Similarly, kisspeptin neurons develop later compared to Î²-End, although, only a few cells are present in the ARH by day 44 of gestation, at which time kisspeptin is also expressed in the developing anterior lobe of the pituitary. By day 70 of gestation, the rostral to caudal distribution and cell size of Kiss1 neurons within the MBH was found to be similar in females and males. In addition, Kiss1 fibers were also expressed in the POA by day 70. By day 130 of gestation, Kiss1 neurons exhibited a wider dorsal and lateral distribution within the MBH, with highly increased fiber distribution.

Based on comb size, chickens were categorized into large comb and small comb groups at market age. Histological analysis revealed that chickens with large combs exhibited thicker dermal, but the central layer exhibits the opposite, with sex-specific differences in collagen fiber content and epithelium thickness. Additionally, while only a few lymphocytes were observed in the combs of the large-comb group, focal lymphocyte aggregation was evident in the small-comb group. Circulating growth hormone (GH) and testosterone levels were significantly higher in chickens with large combs, particularly in roosters, where testosterone levels showed a significant correlation with testicular weight. It was observed that the GH levels were significantly correlated with comb development, independent of sex.

Understanding the impact of GH, including the effect of GHD and rhGH therapy, on metabolism would be a critical step in development of effective treatment and selecting the best management strategies. This article reviews research progress and aims to offer new perspectives on the metabolic state of patients suffering from GHD and to compile data about the impact of rhGH therapy on metabolic pathways.", "entities": [{"entity": "GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY", "start": 1, "end": 25, "matched_text": "GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "SECRETION", "start": 103, "end": 111, "matched_text": "SECRETION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GROWTH HORMONE", "start": 116, "end": 129, "matched_text": "GROWTH HORMONE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GROWTH HORMONE", "start": 116, "end": 129, "matched_text": "GROWTH HORMONE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ENDOCRINE SYSTEM", "start": 229, "end": 244, "matched_text": "ENDOCRINE SYSTEM", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "QUALITY", "start": 329, "end": 335, "matched_text": "QUALITY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "MAIN", "start": 362, "end": 365, "matched_text": "MAIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CARBOHYDRATE", "start": 594, "end": 605, "matched_text": "CARBOHYDRATE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "start": 608, "end": 625, "matched_text": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "start": 608, "end": 625, "matched_text": "INSULIN RESISTANCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DIABETES MELLITUS", "start": 628, "end": 644, "matched_text": "DIABETES MELLITUS", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DIABETES MELLITUS", "start": 628, "end": 644, "matched_text": "DIABETES MELLITUS", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "LIPID", "start": 648, "end": 652, "matched_text": "LIPID", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA", "start": 655, "end": 674, "matched_text": "HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA", "start": 677, "end": 696, "matched_text": "HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 704, "end": 710, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 704, "end": 710, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 739, "end": 748, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "STEP", "start": 986, "end": 989, "matched_text": "STEP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AIMS", "start": 1118, "end": 1121, "matched_text": "AIMS", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Multiple studies in mice with genetically disrupted growth hormone (GH) signaling have demonstrated that such disruption results in reduced body size, robustly increased longevity (> 50% in some cases), and improvements across multiple health parameters. However, it remains unclear how generalizable these findings are across mammals. Evidence in rats is limited and inconsistent. These conflicting results highlight the need for further investigation into the role of GH signaling in longevity across species. To address this gap, we developed a novel GH-deficient rat model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce a 10 bp deletion in exon 3 of the gene encoding rat GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) yielding a non-functional GHRH product. Physiological characterization of GHRH knockout (KO) rats revealed that they were half the body weight of wild-type controls. Additionally, relative to controls, they displayed an increased percent body fat, enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentration, and a decreased reliance on glucose oxidation for energy metabolism, as determined by indirect calorimetry. Analysis of the gut microbial community in adult GHRH-KO rats further revealed a less diverse male microbiome, but a more diverse female KO microbiome compared to controls. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that multiple aspects of the GH activity-deficient phenotype, well-documented in mice, are faithfully recapitulated in our rat model. Therefore, the GHRH-deficient rat model represents a valuable new tool for advancing our understanding of the role of GH signaling in aging processes.", "entities": [{"entity": "MICE", "start": 21, "end": 24, "matched_text": "MICE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GROWTH HORMONE", "start": 53, "end": 66, "matched_text": "GROWTH HORMONE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GROWTH HORMONE", "start": 53, "end": 66, "matched_text": "GROWTH HORMONE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 73, "end": 81, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOW", "start": 284, "end": 286, "matched_text": "HOW", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 337, "end": 344, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 463, "end": 466, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GAP", "start": 529, "end": 531, "matched_text": "GAP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RAT", "start": 568, "end": 570, "matched_text": "RAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DELETION", "start": 628, "end": 635, "matched_text": "DELETION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "EXON", "start": 640, "end": 643, "matched_text": "EXON", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 654, "end": 657, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GENE", "start": 654, "end": 657, "matched_text": "GENE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GHRH", "start": 694, "end": 697, "matched_text": "GHRH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FAT", "start": 943, "end": 945, "matched_text": "FAT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INSULIN", "start": 957, "end": 963, "matched_text": "INSULIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR I", "start": 998, "end": 1025, "matched_text": "INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR I", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 1107, "end": 1116, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GH ACTIVITY", "start": 1401, "end": 1411, "matched_text": "GH ACTIVITY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PHENOTYPE", "start": 1423, "end": 1431, "matched_text": "PHENOTYPE", "type": "disease"}]}
{"text": "Intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) are a major cause of secondary infertility. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of combined recombinant rat growth hormone (rrGH) and estrogen therapy on endometrial fibrosis in IUA rats. Our findings revealed that IUA rats exhibited severe endometrial damage, heightened inflammatory responses, significant collagen deposition, and imbalances in various inflammatory and growth factors. However, these pathological changes were markedly improved following combined rrGH and estrogen treatment. Additionally, the endometrial microbial diversity in IUA rats was significantly reduced, and the combined therapy effectively promoted its restoration. Biochemical serum analysis showed that the combined therapy upregulated key reproductive hormone levels. Notably, the combined application of rrGH and estrogen partially restored GH receptor levels. TGF-Î²1, MMP9, and Î²-catenin were upregulated in the endometria of IUA rats, while the p-smad3/smad3 ratio was downregulated, and these key indicators were reversed after combined therapy. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment weakened the effects of combined therapy, indicating the role of endometrial microbiota in IUA. Molecular docking results revealed a high affinity between Î²-catenin and differential metabolites such as citraconic acid, suggesting their potential importance in regulating the Î²-catenin signaling pathway. In a TGF-Î²1-induced IUA cell model, we found that TGF-Î²1 treatment upregulated fibrosis-related protein expression but decreased Î²-catenin protein levels and stability. Citraconic acid intervention enhanced the effects of TGF-Î²1, while Î²-catenin overexpression inhibited these changes. In summary, the combined therapy targeting the Î²-catenin pathway through citraconic acid regulation alleviated endometrial fibrosis, offering a new approach to treating IUA.IMPORTANCEIntrauterine adhesions (IUAs) are an important endometrial disease. Our study highlights the importance of the combination of recombinant rat growth hormone (rrGH) and estrogen in ameliorating endometrial damage and fibrosis, as well as promoting endometrial regeneration in IUA rats. In addition, our study emphasizes their important role in ameliorating microecological disturbances in the intrauterine environment and regulating serum metabolism. Our experiments also revealed for the first time that the combination of rrGH and estrogen may modulate endometrial microbes or influence the progression of IUA by promoting Î²-catenin expression, which is important for understanding the treatment of IUA disease.

{"text": "Alexamorelin is a synthetic peptide and growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) with potential performance-enhancing properties, making its use and abuse a topic of interest in clinical research and doping monitoring. Alexamorelin mimics the natural peptide hormone ghrelin by binding to the GHS type 1a receptor (GHS-R1a) in the pituitary gland, thereby promoting endogenous growth hormone release. Identifying alexamorelin and/or its metabolite biomarkers is crucial for effective doping controls. The purpose of this study was to determine and characterize biomarkers associated with alexamorelin intake. In silico metabolite predictions were performed using GLORYx freeware, and in vitro incubations were conducted with pooled human hepatocytes from 10 donors. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS), with data processed through Thermo Scientific's Compound Discoverer. GLORYx predicted 21 single-reaction metabolites. N-Acetylation was identified as the primary transformation, with the highest probability score (98%), and occurring either at the C-terminal Ala or the N-terminal Lys. Other predicted transformations included N-oxidation, hydroxylation, amide hydrolysis, oxidative deamination, and phase II N-glucuronidation, with probability scores below 40%. All these transformations were predicted to occur at the two C-terminal (Ala or His) or N-terminal (D-Phe or Lys) amino acids. After 3 h of incubation with hepatocytes, only one metabolite (known as examorelin or hexarelin) was detected, resulting from the C-terminal cleavage of the Ala amino acid; this metabolic reaction is mediated by a carboxypeptidase. The alexamorelin signal decreased approximately 150-fold after 3 h, indicating significant hepatic metabolism. However, examorelin itself is a commercially available GHS secretagogue, and thus, it is not specific to alexamorelin consumption.

We identified 1,049 consistent differentially methylated CpGs (608 relatively hypermethylated) across all three studies (FDR-P<0.05). Relatively hypomethylated CpGs were enriched for gluconeogenesis, cell adhesion and VEGF signaling. Relatively hypermethylated CpGs were enriched for Hippo, B-cell and growth hormone receptor signaling. Functional enrichment suggested potential regulatory roles for active enhancers and histone modifications. Additionally, enrichment in PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways in males and enrichment in hormonal pathways in females was identified.

We identified consistent DNA methylation signatures between birth and childhood in critical metabolic, lung development and immune pathways that were associated with lung function and may be influenced by sex and genetics.Our integrative findings provide a deeper understanding for accelerated lung function decline across the life-course and could pave the way for translational interventions for lung diseases based on epigenetic plasticity.", "entities": [{"entity": "LUNG", "start": 1, "end": 4, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "DNA", "start": 193, "end": 195, "matched_text": "DNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "METHYLATION", "start": 197, "end": 207, "matched_text": "METHYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CHILDHOOD ASTHMA", "start": 340, "end": 355, "matched_text": "CHILDHOOD ASTHMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CAMP", "start": 366, "end": 369, "matched_text": "CAMP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOOD", "start": 448, "end": 452, "matched_text": "BLOOD", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "GLUCONEOGENESIS", "start": 744, "end": 758, "matched_text": "GLUCONEOGENESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL ADHESION", "start": 761, "end": 773, "matched_text": "CELL ADHESION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VEGF SIGNALING", "start": 779, "end": 792, "matched_text": "VEGF SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 854, "end": 857, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 854, "end": 857, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "GROWTH HORMONE RECEPTOR", "start": 863, "end": 885, "matched_text": "GROWTH HORMONE RECEPTOR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 887, "end": 895, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HISTONE", "start": 982, "end": 988, "matched_text": "HISTONE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PI3K", "start": 1033, "end": 1036, "matched_text": "PI3K", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "AKT", "start": 1038, "end": 1040, "matched_text": "AKT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "NOTCH", "start": 1046, "end": 1050, "matched_text": "NOTCH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "SEX", "start": 1170, "end": 1172, "matched_text": "SEX", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HUB", "start": 1213, "end": 1215, "matched_text": "HUB", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ASTHMA", "start": 1313, "end": 1318, "matched_text": "ASTHMA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "ASTHMA", "start": 1313, "end": 1318, "matched_text": "ASTHMA", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "DRUG", "start": 1324, "end": 1327, "matched_text": "DRUG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PUBERTY", "start": 1429, "end": 1435, "matched_text": "PUBERTY", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "DNA METHYLATION", "start": 1722, "end": 1736, "matched_text": "DNA METHYLATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LUNG DEVELOPMENT", "start": 1800, "end": 1815, "matched_text": "LUNG DEVELOPMENT", "type": "gene"}]}

The extent to which TEs have contributed to NF-kB responses during mammalian evolution is not well established. Here, we performed a multi-species analysis of TEs bound by the NF-kB subunit RELA in response to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. By comparing RELA ChIP-seq data from TNF-stimulated primary aortic endothelial cells isolated from human, mouse, and cow, we find that 55 TE subfamilies are associated with RELA-bound regions, many of which reside near TNF-responsive genes. A prominent example of lineage-specific contribution of transposons comes from the bovine SINE subfamilies Bov-tA1/2/3 which collectively contributed over 14,000 RELA-bound regions in cow. By comparing RELA binding data across species, we also find several examples of RELA motif-bearing TEs that colonized the genome prior to the divergence of the three species and contributed to species-specific RELA binding.

Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people with MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the aging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA. We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50 Âµg/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24 h. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR. Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7 Â± 12.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (Î²=-0.003, p < 0.001). Among the subgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (Î²=-0.27, p = 0.04) but not men (Î²=-0.1, p = 0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.6% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory analyses, older pwMS (â¥ 50 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines than younger pwMS (< 50 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) mediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR.

{"text": "It is well known that the microenvironment in which an immune response develops, generally pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, along with other overproduced biomolecules recognized by pattern recognition receptors, may promote the stimulation and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages with effector functions. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a fundamental role in cholesterol transport. By contrast, its oxidized form (ox-LDL), which is overexpressed in conditions of obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation, has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. Depending on the microenvironmental context, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) participates in various scenarios such as inflammation, anti-inflammation, and homeostasis. Therefore, obesity-derived biomolecules such as LDL, ox-LDL, and PGE2 could induce the differentiation of immune cells into effector populations with either pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive profiles. In the present work, we studied the effects of LDL, ox-LDL, and PGE2 on the differentiation of the human THP1 monocytic cell line into macrophages under two different protocols, analyzing several activation markers associated with either pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 profiles by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our data suggest that native LDL induces the differentiation of human THP1 monocytes into M1 macrophages even more efficiently than classic phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, whereas ox-LDL and PGE2 induce the expression of activation markers similarly to interferon gamma or interleukin 4 during PMA preactivation of macrophages. The results of this study add evidence to the role of obesity-derived biomolecules as non-canonical differentiation stimuli in macrophages, which could be relevant in contexts where these biomolecules are chronically overproduced, such as obesity, low-grade inflammation, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.", "entities": [{"entity": "IMMUNE RESPONSE", "start": 56, "end": 70, "matched_text": "IMMUNE RESPONSE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN", "start": 322, "end": 344, "matched_text": "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ROLE", "start": 372, "end": 375, "matched_text": "ROLE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT", "start": 380, "end": 400, "matched_text": "CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 484, "end": 490, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "OBESITY", "start": 484, "end": 490, "matched_text": "OBESITY", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CHRONIC", "start": 496, "end": 502, "matched_text": "CHRONIC", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 514, "end": 525, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "INFLAMMATION", "start": 514, "end": 525, "matched_text": "INFLAMMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "HOMEOSTASIS", "start": 726, "end": 736, "matched_text": "HOMEOSTASIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "THP1", "start": 1049, "end": 1052, "matched_text": "THP1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1064, "end": 1067, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 1064, "end": 1067, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "INTERFERON GAMMA", "start": 1554, "end": 1569, "matched_text": "INTERFERON GAMMA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ADD", "start": 1655, "end": 1657, "matched_text": "ADD", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EVIDENCE", "start": 1659, "end": 1666, "matched_text": "EVIDENCE", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "TYPE 2 DIABETES", "start": 1901, "end": 1915, "matched_text": "TYPE 2 DIABETES", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 1922, "end": 1927, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 1922, "end": 1927, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}]}

Here, we refute this view and instead show that IFN-Î³-driven induction of non-canonical autophagy via gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated proteins (GABARAPs) has a critical functional role in IFN-Î³-mediated elimination of LS. Furthermore, mediators of lysosomal maturation and fusion also have important functions in this process. Recruitment of GABARAPs to the LS parasitophorous vacuole (PV) compartment likely promotes the fusion of the PV membrane with lysosomes, thereby leading to elimination of intra-hepatocytic parasites. In contrast, LC3 has an infection-supportive function by protecting LS from GABARAP-mediated elimination.

{"text": "While immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) demonstrate clinical efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), tumor cells frequently evade immune surveillance through PD-L1 overexpression, a phenomenon whose regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Through integrated analysis of single-cell transcription sequence data, we identified aberrant upregulation of Lamin B2 (LMNB2) specifically in immunotherapy-sensitive HCC patients. Functional characterization revealed that LMNB2 acts as a transcriptional regulator of PD-L1, potentiating immune escape mechanisms in HCC cells during co-culture with Jurkat cells. Notably, we discovered that speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) directly interacts with LMNB2 to mediate its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining physiological PD-L1 expression levels. Clinically relevant SPOP mutations or reduced SPOP expression impaired this regulatory mechanism, leading to LMNB2 accumulation and subsequent PD-L1 hyperactivation. Importantly, combinatorial targeting of LMNB2 with Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) displayed a synergistic effect on suppressing tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo, particularly in HCC models with SPOP mutations or LMNB2 overexpression.

{"text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), with sudden cardiac death (SCD) constituting a primary cause of death, the molecular mechanisms of which are yet to be fully elucidated. Ubiquitin-specific protease 38 (USP38) has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in CKD-related ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is yet to be clarified. This research systematically explores the involvement of USP38 in the development of VAs in CKD. This study employed cardiac-specific Usp38 knockout and transgenic Usp38 mice, along with H9c2 cells transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying Usp38 (AdUsp38) or shRNA targeting Usp38 (AdshUsp38). The mouse model was generated via 5/6 nephrectomy, and CKD cell models were created using indoxyl sulfate (IS) induction. These models underwent extensive evaluation, including echocardiography, electrophysiology, histological studies, and molecular analysis. In CKD mouse models, USP38 expression was markedly elevated and predominantly localized in ventricular myocytes. Knocking out Usp38 markedly decreased the susceptibility and duration of rapid VAs in CKD mice and corrected the abnormal expression of ion channel proteins. Comparable findings were observed in Usp38 transgenic mouse models. From a mechanistic perspective, Usp38 knockout reduced oxidative stress in cardiac tissues and upregulated antioxidative enzyme expression. The enhancement was mainly achieved by increasing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) ubiquitination and degradation, along with inhibition of downstream CaMKII activity. In contrast, USP38 overexpression had harmful effects on the heart, which were alleviated by NOX4 inhibition.

{"text": "Deubiquitinases (DUBs) play a critical role in the regulation of various cellular processes, such as protein homeostasis and signaling, rendering them attractive drug targets. However, the generation of reagents for measuring DUB activity typically involves several steps and is not straight forward. Here, we report the development and characterization of a novel fluorescent polarization assay using an isopeptide bond substrate mimetic (IsoMim) that can be made recombinantly in high yields. The IsoMim assay was able to discern the differential activity of ubiquitin specific protease family members (USP4, USP15, USP11 and USP2), the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL3 and the Machado-Joseph Domain deubiquitinase JOSD2. A competition assay format of the assay was developed that discerned differences between the close paralogues USP15, USP4 and USP11 in interacting with mono-ubiquitin, the isopeptide mimetic ubiquitin-GGG and the C-terminal truncation variant ubiquitin (1-74). Moreover, dose-response curves and associated pIC50 values using the broad-spectrum inhibitor PR-619 confirmed differential inhibition in the low Î¼M range for four tested DUBs. The successful discrimination of DUB activity and inhibition, and the easily scalable generation of the substrate make the IsoMim assay method applicable for high-throughput screening (HTS). This was ascertained in a 'pseudo HTS screen' for USP4 inhibitors in which PR-619 was successfully identified as a 'pseudo hit'.

{"text": "Four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) acts as a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression. This study explored its involvement in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Bioinformatics analysis assessed FHL2 expression and survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR, and Western blotting (WB) were performed to assess FHL2 levels in LUSC tissue microarrays (TMA) and cell lines. In vitro, CCK-8, plate colony formation, wound healing, and Matrigel Transwell assays were conducted to investigate the effects of FHL2 on LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo, xenograft tumor models were utilized to evaluate the role of FHL2 in LUSC progression. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation (IP) and proximity ligation assays (PLA) were performed to explore the interaction between FHL2 and c-Jun. The cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was conducted to assess c-Jun stability in the context of FHL2 overexpression or knockdown. The influence of differential FHL2 expression on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway was analyzed via WB. Furthermore, xenograft tumor models, WB, and IHC were employed to determine whether FHL2 mediates LUSC resistance to afatinib. FHL2 expression was significantly upregulated in LUSC tissues, as demonstrated by the TCGA database analysis and validated through IHC staining of TMA. Moreover, elevated FHL2 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in LUSC patients. FHL2 overexpression enhanced LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro while accelerating xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, FHL2 knockdown exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, FHL2 interacts with c-Jun and suppresses its ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the c-Jun protein, upregulating PDK1 expression, and subsequently activating the PAM signaling pathway. Notably, FHL2 overexpression induced afatinib resistance in LUSC cells, and patients with afatinib resistance exhibited high levels of FHL2 expression. Our results demonstrate that FHL2 promotes LUSC progression and induces afatinib resistance by regulating the PAM signaling pathway.

However, the E3 ligase of TGFBR2 was not known. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac fibroblasts, we identified C-terminal interacting protein of HSP70 (CHIP) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase utilized by BAG3 for TGFBR2 degradation in cardiac fibroblasts. Overexpression of CHIP significantly decreased TGFBR2 stability, while inhibition of CHIP led to increased sensitivity to TGF-Î² and subsequent promotion of a fibrogenic program. Further, the BAG3-HSP70 interaction was crucial to this process, as disruption of the axis increased TGFBR2 stability and sensitivity to TGF-Î² signaling.

{"text": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, plays a critical role in various pathological conditions, including cancer and organ injury. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically regulate ferroptosis by modulating the stability, activity, and interactions of key proteins such as GPX4, SLC7A11, and ACSL4. A single protein can undergo multiple PTMs, and the same regulatory enzyme may exert opposing effects on ferroptosis by modifying different proteins. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of PTMs in regulatory proteins is essential for elucidating their overall impact on ferroptosis. This review systematically examines the roles of ubiquitination, ubiquitin-like modifications (e.g. UFMylation, SUMOylation), alkylation, and succination in ferroptosis regulation. We highlight how E3 ligases, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and other PTM-associated enzymes modulate ferroptosis by governing the degradation or stabilization of key targets, thereby influencing redox homeostasis and iron metabolism. Clinically, PTM-targeting agents, including E3 ligase modulators and SUMOylation inhibitors, demonstrate therapeutic potential in preclinical models, though their clinical translation remains in its early stages.

Body weight, body temperature, sperm motility, serum hormone levels, organ indices, and histopathological changes of rats were evaluated. AQP1 was knocked down to detect the effect of AQP1 on lipid metabolism in KYDS rats. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation were used to verify the relationship between CBL and AQP1, and CBL knockdown KYDS rats were constructed to test the effect of CBL on AQP1 ubiquitination.

Knockdown of the AQP1 gene in KYDS rats resulted in decreased body weight, body temperature, sperm motility, and testicular index, along with increased renal index. It also resulted in changes of serum hormone levels and exacerbated pathologic changes. Additionally, AQP1 knockdown further suppressed lipid accumulation in KYDS rats, as evidenced by reductions in lipid droplets and the expression of lipid synthesis proteins. Intriguingly, elevated expression of CBL was observed in KYDS, and its knockdown inhibited the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AQP1.

{"text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential modulators in tumor progression. While fatty acid (FA) metabolism can potentiate tumorigenesis, colonization, and metastasis, the roles of lncRNAs in reprograming FA metabolism and regulating gastric cancer (GC) metastasis remain elusive. Whole RNA-sequencing and in silico analyses were conducted to identify clinically significant lncRNAs involved in GC metastasis. Among the identified lncRNAs, we focused on the novel lncRNA TENM3-AS1. RT-qPCR and FISH analyses revealed an increased expression of TENM3-AS1 in GC cell lines and patients. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments validated the effects of TENM3-AS1 to GC metastasis and the reprogramming of FA metabolism. ChIP, Biotinylated RNA pull-down, RIP, CHX-chase assay, ubiquitination assay, and RNA stabilization assay were employed to perceive the mechanisms underlying the effects of TENM3-AS1 in GC cells. TENM3-AS1 expression was significantly elevated in metastatic tumors and advanced primary tumors of GC patients. This increased expression was also associated with a worsened overall survival and progression-free survival. Functionally, TENM3-AS1 enhanced the migration and invasiveness of GC cells in vitro, promoted tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo, and increased FA biosynthesis in GC cells. Mechanistically, our studies showed that the transcription factor EGR1 activated TENM3-AS1, which in turn upregulated the expression of FASN and hnRNPK. Furthermore, TENM3-AS1 interacted with and stabilized hnRNPK by increasing its deubiquitination. This interaction reprogrammed FA metabolism and promoted GC progression by increasing FASN mRNA stability through hnRNPK. In this study, by comparing lncRNA sequencing data from paired primary and peritoneal metastatic tumors and public transcriptome data from non-metastatic and metastatic samples, we clarified a novel lncRNA, TENM3-AS1. It was found that TENM3-AS1 was aberrantly activated in metastatic and advanced primary tumors, and was strongly correlated with a shorter survival in GC patients. Our study reveals the EGR1/TENM3-AS1/ hnRNPK/FASN axis as a novel curative target in metastatic GC.", "entities": [{"entity": "TUMOR", "start": 60, "end": 64, "matched_text": "TUMOR", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "METABOLISM", "start": 101, "end": 110, "matched_text": "METABOLISM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "GASTRIC CANCER", "start": 238, "end": 251, "matched_text": "GASTRIC CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "GASTRIC CANCER", "start": 238, "end": 251, "matched_text": "GASTRIC CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 291, "end": 293, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA", "start": 291, "end": 293, "matched_text": "RNA", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TENM3", "start": 475, "end": 479, "matched_text": "TENM3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AS1", "start": 481, "end": 483, "matched_text": "AS1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FISH", "start": 498, "end": 501, "matched_text": "FISH", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 564, "end": 567, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 564, "end": 567, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CHIP", "start": 725, "end": 728, "matched_text": "CHIP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RIP", "start": 759, "end": 761, "matched_text": "RIP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RNA STABILIZATION", "start": 807, "end": 823, "matched_text": "RNA STABILIZATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "LIVER", "start": 1257, "end": 1261, "matched_text": "LIVER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "BIOSYNTHESIS", "start": 1300, "end": 1311, "matched_text": "BIOSYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "start": 1371, "end": 1390, "matched_text": "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EGR1", "start": 1392, "end": 1395, "matched_text": "EGR1", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "FASN", "start": 1462, "end": 1465, "matched_text": "FASN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "HNRNPK", "start": 1471, "end": 1476, "matched_text": "HNRNPK", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEUBIQUITINATION", "start": 1558, "end": 1573, "matched_text": "DEUBIQUITINATION", "type": "gene"}]}
{"text": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading malignancy among men and lacks effective treatment, particularly for metastatic stages. Metastasis contributes significantly to cancer morbidity and mortality. Gilteritinib showed anticancer activity against lung and colorectal cancer but has not been thoroughly investigated for its potential in PCa therapy. This study evaluated the anticancer effects of gilteritinib on PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) by assessing cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Mechanistic studies were conducted to determine its impact on the cell cycle, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Additionally, the mode of cell death was explored, focusing on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein ubiquitination. Gilteritinib exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited PCa cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. It induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest by downregulating CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin E1. EMT modulation was observed through the suppression of vimentin, N-cadherin, and Twist, along with increased E-cadherin expression. This EMT inhibition correlated with the downregulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling components. Notably, gilteritinib triggered a non-apoptotic, non-autophagic cell death characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolation, ER stress, and protein ubiquitination, requiring new protein synthesis. This effect was mediated through the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) via the PERK pathway. Gilteritinib demonstrates significant anticancer potential in PCa by inducing cell cycle arrest, inhibiting EMT, suppressing Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, and triggering a unique mode of cell death via ER stress. These findings highlight gilteritinib as a promising therapeutic candidate for PCa treatment.", "entities": [{"entity": "PROSTATE CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 15, "matched_text": "PROSTATE CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "PROSTATE CANCER", "start": 1, "end": 15, "matched_text": "PROSTATE CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "PCA", "start": 18, "end": 20, "matched_text": "PCA", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 164, "end": 169, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CANCER", "start": 164, "end": 169, "matched_text": "CANCER", "type": "symptom"}, {"entity": "LUNG", "start": 244, "end": 247, "matched_text": "LUNG", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "COLORECTAL CANCER", "start": 253, "end": 269, "matched_text": "COLORECTAL CANCER", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 413, "end": 416, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 413, "end": 416, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PC3", "start": 425, "end": 427, "matched_text": "PC3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "start": 467, "end": 484, "matched_text": "CELL PROLIFERATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "FORMATION", "start": 494, "end": 502, "matched_text": "FORMATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE", "start": 586, "end": 595, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EMT", "start": 636, "end": 638, "matched_text": "EMT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "EMT", "start": 636, "end": 638, "matched_text": "EMT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "SIGNALING", "start": 661, "end": 669, "matched_text": "SIGNALING", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "MODE", "start": 690, "end": 693, "matched_text": "MODE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL DEATH", "start": 698, "end": 707, "matched_text": "CELL DEATH", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "start": 735, "end": 755, "matched_text": "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN UBIQUITINATION", "start": 773, "end": 794, "matched_text": "PROTEIN UBIQUITINATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "G1 PHASE", "start": 930, "end": 937, "matched_text": "G1 PHASE", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CELL CYCLE ARREST", "start": 939, "end": 955, "matched_text": "CELL CYCLE ARREST", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CDK2", "start": 975, "end": 978, "matched_text": "CDK2", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CDK4", "start": 981, "end": 984, "matched_text": "CDK4", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN", "start": 991, "end": 996, "matched_text": "CYCLIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "CYCLIN", "start": 991, "end": 996, "matched_text": "CYCLIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 1057, "end": 1064, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "VIMENTIN", "start": 1057, "end": 1064, "matched_text": "VIMENTIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "N-CADHERIN", "start": 1067, "end": 1076, "matched_text": "N-CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TWIST", "start": 1083, "end": 1087, "matched_text": "TWIST", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "E-CADHERIN", "start": 1111, "end": 1120, "matched_text": "E-CADHERIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "AUTOPHAGIC CELL DEATH", "start": 1282, "end": 1302, "matched_text": "AUTOPHAGIC CELL DEATH", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN SYNTHESIS", "start": 1399, "end": 1415, "matched_text": "PROTEIN SYNTHESIS", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1482, "end": 1488, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 1482, "end": 1488, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "PERK", "start": 1513, "end": 1516, "matched_text": "PERK", "type": "protein"}]}
{"text": "SMAD5 has been demonstrated to promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through the circ_0001825/miR-1270/SMAD5 axis or KCNQ1OT1/miR-320a/SMAD5 axis. Therefore, SMAD5 may be a key regulator of BMSCs osteogenic differentiation, and its more related molecular mechanisms are worth further revealing. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein levels of SMAD5, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 53 (USP53), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3), and osteogenic differentiation-related markers. Cell counting kit 8 and transwell assay were performed to measure cell viability and invasion. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity detection and Alizarin red S staining were employed to assess osteogenic differentiation. The interactions between USP53 and SMAD5/EIF4A3 were confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation assay. The mRNA levels of SMAD5 and USP53 were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. SMAD5 silencing suppressed viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while its overexpression had opposite effects. USP53 deubiquitinated SMAD5 to stabilize its protein expression. Moreover, USP53 knockdown inhibited viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while these effects were reverted by SMAD5 overexpression. EIF4A3 stabilized USP53 mRNA expression, and the inhibitory effect of EIF4A3 silencing on viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was abolished by USP53 overexpression. Furthermore, EIF4A3 enhanced SMAD5 expression by interacting with USP53. EIF4A3-stabilized USP53 promotes SMAD5 deubiquitination to enhance viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.", "entities": [{"entity": "SMAD5", "start": 1, "end": 5, "matched_text": "SMAD5", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BONE MARROW", "start": 70, "end": 80, "matched_text": "BONE MARROW", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "MIR", "start": 138, "end": 140, "matched_text": "MIR", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KEY", "start": 217, "end": 219, "matched_text": "KEY", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "BLOT", "start": 347, "end": 350, "matched_text": "BLOT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 384, "end": 390, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "PROTEIN", "start": 384, "end": 390, "matched_text": "PROTEIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 409, "end": 417, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "UBIQUITIN", "start": 409, "end": 417, "matched_text": "UBIQUITIN", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "USP53", "start": 442, "end": 446, "matched_text": "USP53", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "TRANSLATION INITIATION", "start": 461, "end": 482, "matched_text": "TRANSLATION INITIATION", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "EIF4A3", "start": 496, "end": 501, "matched_text": "EIF4A3", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 553, "end": 556, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "disease"}, {"entity": "CELL", "start": 553, "end": 556, "matched_text": "CELL", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "KIT", "start": 567, "end": 569, "matched_text": "KIT", "type": "gene"}, {"entity": "KIT", "start": 567, "end": 569, "matched_text": "KIT", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE", "start": 648, "end": 667, "matched_text": "ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "ALP", "start": 670, "end": 672, "matched_text": "ALP", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "RED", "start": 707, "end": 709, "matched_text": "RED", "type": "protein"}, {"entity": "DEUBIQUITINATION", "start": 1610, "end": 1625, "matched_text": "DEUBIQUITINATION", "type": "gene"}]}
