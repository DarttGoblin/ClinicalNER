Descriptive statistics were calculated for (sub)scale and item scores. Variance-components linear random-effect multi-level modelling (nested random intercepts for country and study) estimated overall mean (sub)scale scores, 95% confidence intervals, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% prediction intervals. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests provided inference for country- and study-specific heterogeneity. Eleven studies were included from six countries (Australia k = 2, Canada k = 1, Japan k = 2, New Zealand k = 1, UAE k = 1, USA k = 4) in four languages (Arabic k = 1, English k = 7, Japanese k = 2, Spanish k = 1). Six studies included n = 3114 adults with T1D (insulin pump: 42%; 75% aged <60 years). Ten studies included n = 6586 adults with T2D (insulin-treated: 37%; 44% aged <60 years). Most reported \u22651 experience of diabetes stigma (T1D = 91%; study range: 84%-96%; T2D = 77%; 69%-89%). In 10 studies, the 'blame and judgment' subscale was most endorsed (T1D = 83%; 62%-89%, T2D = 70%; 53%-79%). Most adults with T1D reported 'identity concerns' (73%; 62%-80%), and 47% of adults with T2D reported 'self-stigma' (30-60%). Being 'treated differently' was least common (T1D = 46%; 40%-54%, T2D = 37%; 28%-47%). Low levels of heterogeneity were observed in mean [SE] total scores (DSAS-1: 54 [0.94] ICC = 0.02, p < 0.001; DSAS-2: 44 [1.1], ICC \u22640.4, p < 0.001).

It is predicted that many premature infants, especially severe premature infants, will be discharged with growth restriction. Extrauterine growth retardation (EUGR) is defined as growth below the 10th percentile of the growth curve at discharge at corrected 36th/40th week of gestation, or a difference between birth and discharge z-score > 1 SD. The aim of our study is to determine the differences between the INTERGROWTH-21ST and the Fenton chart in the assessment of extrauterine growth. Infants < 1500 g born or transferred in the first 24 h at Ankara University NICU between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 were included. Infants with major congenital anomalies, unknown gestational age, chromosomal anomalies, hydrops fetalis, TORCH infection, infants born to substance abusing mothers, and infants who died during hospitalization were excluded. According to the Fenton, the rate of EUGR at discharge was 66.3%. There was no significant difference between the groups EUGR and non-EUGR in gender, gestational diabetes, maternal smoking during pregnancy, placental abruption, magnesium sulphate prophylaxis, development of respiratory distress, and need for intubation in the first 3 days after birth. When patients were grouped according to birth weight, the highest rate of EUGR according to the Fenton was found in the group with a birth weight \u2264 1000 g (78.8%) (p = 0.036). The proportion of patients defined as SGA by INTERGROWTH-21ST was significantly higher than by Fenton (p < 0.001). Comparing the mean z scores for body weight, height and head circumference at birth and discharge calculated from the Fenton and INTERGROWTH-21 charts, the z scores for body weight and height at birth and discharge were significantly lower in the INTERGROWTH-21 (p < 0.001). Head circumference z-scores at birth and discharge were found to be higher in the Fenton chart than in the INTERGROWTH-21ST (p < 0.001). When EUGR rates were evaluated by body weight in Fenton and INTERGROWTH-21ST, the EUGR rate was found to be higher in Fenton (p < 0.001). The results show that when INTERGROWTH-21ST and Fenton are compared, INTERGROWTH-21ST is more sensitive in defining the SGA rate. The Fenton is more sensitive in defining EUGR at discharge. These differences between the charts make it difficult to monitor the growth of premature infants and to follow comorbidities. Therefore, the establishment of ideal growth curves is of great importance both during hospitalization and after discharge of premature infants."}

Effective and sustainable glycemic control remains elusive, prompting exploration into unconventional sources of metabolic insights. Social insects, in particular bees and ants, exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations enabling them to thrive on carbohydrate-rich diets without developing metabolic disorders typical in humans. This review investigates the bees and ants metabolic strategies to avoid metabolic disorders like diabetes, focusing on their enzymatic pathways such as trehalose metabolism, specialized hormonal regulation involving insulin-like peptides, adipokinetic hormones, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning their metabolic resilience. By systematically comparing these insect adaptations with human metabolic systems, the proposed study identifies potential translational applications, including engineered probiotics, gene-editing approaches, and bioactive compounds for diabetes management. Furthermore, it explores technical, ethical, and ecological considerations for translating insect-derived metabolic mechanisms into human therapies. Highlighting both opportunities and challenges, this review emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research to responsibly integrate nature-inspired solutions into modern diabetes care."}

This study aimed to delineate the subgroup-specific relationships between the two by exploring cumulative and threshold effects. 3,040 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline evidence of DKD were included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to investigate the potential relationship between HDL-C level and DKD risk. To address subgroup heterogeneity, sex-stratified restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to model nonlinear relationships. The optimal threshold was identified through the maximum selected statistics and validated via 1,000 bootstrap iterations. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, diabetes duration, and metabolic status were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves further validated these threshold effects. During a median follow-up of 3.13 years, 665 subjects (21.9%) progressed to DKD. Overall, each 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level independently reduced DKD risk by 43%. RCS analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between HDL-C and DKD risk (P for overall = 0.025, P for nonlinear = 0.317), with increased risk reduction at lower concentrations, plateauing at higher levels. A robust threshold of 0.93 mmol/L was identified, showing significantly stronger protection against DKD progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69, P < 0.001) compared to the traditional cutoff (HR = 0.86, P = 0.109). Females showed continuous protection (HR = 0.41, P = 0.009) without threshold dependency.

Lipoic acid (LA), a compound with antioxidant, insulin-sensitization, anti-inflammatory, and prooxidant activities, has been proven to inhibit lipid deposition. Many studies have shown that supplementation of LA can alleviate MASLD. Therefore, the latest evidence on the relationship between LA and MASLD is presented in this review. The effect of LA on the accumulation of fat in the liver is emphasized following different diet models (normal, high fat, high fructose, choline deficiency) and other models (gene mutation, diabetes), with the main mechanisms from mitochondrial function to inflammation and oxidative stress being summarized.

A cohort of 449 asymptomatic T2DM patients was categorized into four groups: those without DN(G0) and those with DN, which was further subdivided into stages G1, G2, and G3. Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left atrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains during the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we investigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN group were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death. (1) Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences in echocardiographic data for left ventricular size or function across groups. (2) Correlation analysis after multivariable adjustment revealed that the LA minimal volume index (LAVImin) increased with the progression of DN, while the absolute value of the LA strain index(reservoir and conduit period) decreased as renal damage worsened, exhibiting a highly significant correlation with the GFR (P < 0.01).

A large body of literature links EHEs to multiple health endpoints. While children's physiology and activity patterns differ from those of adults in ways that are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to such endpoints, research gaps remain regarding the specific impacts of EHEs on child health. This study evaluated pediatric emergency healthcare utilizations associated with EHEs in Ontario. Applying a space-time stratified case-crossover design, associations between EHEs (same-day or lagged exposure to 2 consecutive days of daily maximum temperatures above percentile thresholds) and 15 causes of pediatric emergency healthcare use in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2015 were analysed using conditional quasi-Poisson regression. In primary analyses, EHEs were defined as two or more consecutive days with temperatures above the 99th percentile of temperature within each respective forward sortation area (FSA). Emergency healthcare use was measured using hospital admissions as an indicator of severe outcomes, and emergency department (ED) visits as a sensitive measure of outcomes. Relative to non-EHE days, EHEs increased the rates of pediatric hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses by 26% (95% CI: 14-40%), asthma by 29% (16-44%); infectious and parasitic diseases by 36% (24-50%), lower respiratory infections by 50% (36-67%), and enteritis by 19% (7-32%). EHEs also increased the rates of ED visits for lower respiratory infections by 10% (0-21%), asthma by 18% (7-29%), heat-related illnesses by 211% (193-230%), heatstroke by 590% (550-622%), and dehydration by 35% (25-46%), but not for other causes.

This study aimed to delineate the subgroup-specific relationships between the two by exploring cumulative and threshold effects. 3,040 patients with type 2 diabetes and no baseline evidence of DKD were included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to investigate the potential relationship between HDL-C level and DKD risk. To address subgroup heterogeneity, sex-stratified restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to model nonlinear relationships. The optimal threshold was identified through the maximum selected statistics and validated via 1,000 bootstrap iterations. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, diabetes duration, and metabolic status were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves further validated these threshold effects. During a median follow-up of 3.13 years, 665 subjects (21.9%) progressed to DKD. Overall, each 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C level independently reduced DKD risk by 43%. RCS analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between HDL-C and DKD risk (P for overall = 0.025, P for nonlinear = 0.317), with increased risk reduction at lower concentrations, plateauing at higher levels. A robust threshold of 0.93 mmol/L was identified, showing significantly stronger protection against DKD progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69, P < 0.001) compared to the traditional cutoff (HR = 0.86, P = 0.109). Females showed continuous protection (HR = 0.41, P = 0.009) without threshold dependency. The male and diabetes duration < 10 years subgroups exhibited threshold effects at > 0.93 mmol/L without continuous protection.

All surviving endemic cretinism patients (n = 31) and matched controls (n = 97) were investigated in December 2020. iodine concentration in urinary and serum, thyroid function parameters, lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TRIG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)], fasting blood glucose (FBG), and blood pressure measurements [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] were assessed. Endemic cretinism patients exhibited significantly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism compared to controls. Serum TC and TRIG concentrations were markedly higher in endemic cretinism patients than in controls (5.27 mmol/L vs. 4.73 mmol/L, P = 0.009; and 1.65 mmol/L vs. 1.04 mmol/L, P < 0.001, respectively). The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia was significantly higher in endemic cretinism patients (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that endemic cretinism was an independent risk factor for both hypercholesterolemia [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.870, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.129-7.298] and hypertriglyceridemia (AOR = 5.912, 95% CI: 2.261-15.455). Adult endemic cretinism patients demonstrate significantly elevated serum lipid levels and are more susceptible to hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, conditions closely associated with their underlying hypothyroidism.

Although previous studies and meta-analyses found an association between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease later in life, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal. Furthermore, research conducted to date has not consistently excluded women with chronic hypertension and/or kidney disease prior to pregnancy, indicating a possible selection bias. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of the updated literature on renal outcomes in women who were healthy prior to pregnancy and experienced pre-eclampsia. We searched PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase for eligible studies. We included retrospective and prospective studies involving healthy women with pre-eclampsia and reporting kidney outcomes. Of the 2,796 titles originally screened, 9 studies met our inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analytic model was used for statistical analysis. A statistically significant increase in the risk of developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease later in life following pre-eclampsia was found (meta-analytic risk ratios [95% confidence interval]: 1.83 [1.16-2.89] and 8.96 [4.94-16.23], respectively), with high statistical heterogeneity. However, the only prospective study did not find a significant association between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease. Although a significant association was identified, its clinical relevance and causality remain unclear. Postpartum medical investigation in women affected by pre-eclampsia is essential, but long-term follow-up may not be indicated in the absence of underlying conditions. Only prospective studies could clarify the relationship between pre-eclampsia and kidney disease in women who were healthy before pregnancy."}

This review explores RV structural, functional, and physiologic considerations, emphasizing their interplay with pulmonary hypertension (PH), heart failure, and perioperative outcomes. Traditional pressure- and volume-centric methods of RV evaluation, including echocardiography and right heart catheterization, often fail to provide comprehensive, load-independent measures of RV function. The integration of these measures for pressure-volume (PV) loop analysis has emerged as a valuable tool, offering insights into RV contractility, compliance, and ventriculoarterial coupling. This review highlights advances in intraoperative and noninvasive PV loop methodologies, including echocardiography-derived techniques and integration with catheter-based pressure measurements. These approaches enable detailed assessment of RV function, enhancing prognostic capabilities in such conditions as PH, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and postsurgical interventions like left ventricular assist device implantation and valve replacement. Despite the potential of RV PV loop analysis, its clinical adoption has been limited by technical complexities, cost, and the need for specialized expertise. This underscores the importance of standardizing PV loop acquisition techniques and validating surrogate markers, such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/pulmonary artery systolic pressure ratio, to improve accessibility and utility. By providing a comprehensive overview of current and emerging methods for RV assessment, this review aims to foster a deeper understanding of RV mechanics, driving innovation in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies for cardiac surgeries."}

However, the relationship between the extent of DVT and outcomes after thrombectomy has not been explored. The objective of this study was to compare rates of post-thrombectomy DVT recurrence between patients with isolated iliofemoral DVT and patients with iliofemoral DVT and extension more peripherally. We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT from 2014-2023. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: (1) iliofemoral DVT without popliteal/tibial extension or (2) iliofemoral DVT with popliteal/tibial extension. The primary outcome was acute DVT recurrence and multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk factors for recurrence. Chi-squared and t-tests were calculated for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare rates of acute DVT and chronic venous changes postoperatively. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 222 patients were identified during the study period (76 isolated iliofemoral DVT vs. 146 iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension) with a median follow-up of 19 months. Patients who presented with iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension were more likely to be older (57 vs. 50 years, p=0.004), have hypertension (64% vs. 41%, p=0.001) or hyperlipidemia (58% vs. 40%, p=0.01), and to have had surgery within the prior 6-months (29% vs. 17%, p=0.04). Amongst female patients, those on hormone therapy were more likely to have isolated iliofemoral DVT (17% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Patients with iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension had a greater chance of developing recurrent acute DVT (48% vs. 20%, p<0.001) and chronic venous changes (51% vs. 30%, p=0.004) during follow-up. Multivariable analysis showed a significant correlation between iliofemoral DVT with peripheral extension (Odds ratio 3.8 [95% confidence interval 1.7-8.7], p=0.001) and acute DVT recurrence. There were no differences in the rates of reintervention or death. More extensive peripheral thrombus burden was associated with higher rates of follow-up DVT recurrence in patients undergoing thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT. These findings suggest that such patients may require closer follow-up and more aggressive anticoagulation therapy postoperatively. Moreover, our results provide a framework for further studies to specifically study the role peripheral thrombus may play in venous hemodynamics and the development of recurrent DVT and, ultimately, PTS."}

This study evaluated mid-to-long-term outcomes of conservatively managed SICAD. This single-center, retrospective cohort study identified patients with SICAD from January 2011-December 2022 in the institutional electronic health record. Demographics, comorbidities, radiographic features, management, and outcomes were reviewed. Clinical endpoints were symptomatic remission, significant organ malperfusion, rupture, and secondary intervention. Radiographic endpoints included dissection remodeling (i.e., shortened dissection length or increased true lumen diameter), celiac aneurysm incidence, and aneurysm diameter growth among <1.5 cm, 1.5-1.9 cm, and \u22652.0 cm size categories. Endpoints were stratified by symptomatic vs. incidental presentation. Forty-nine patients with SICAD were identified. Eighty percent were male, and 57% had hypertension. Extra-celiac aneurysms were present in 25%, including 12% with aortic aneurysms. Forty-nine percent of SICADs were symptomatic on presentation, while 51% were incidentally discovered. Patients with incidental SICAD were older than symptomatic patients (62 \u00b1 15 years vs. 54 \u00b1 8 years, p=0.02) but had similar comorbidities. Ninety-two percent of symptomatic patients experienced complete symptom resolution without operative intervention by the earliest follow-up (182 \u00b1 386 days). No incidental cases developed symptoms over a mean of 3.9 \u00b1 3.5 years. No significant organ malperfusion, rupture, or secondary intervention occurred in this series. Symptomatic SICAD was more likely to undergo remodeling than incidental SICAD (p=0.02) over an average of 3.3 \u00b1 3.7 years. Thirty-two percent of symptomatic cases had partial remodeling, and 37% had no residual dissection. Seventy-one percent of incidental dissections remained stable without remodeling. Celiac thrombus on initial imaging predicted remodeling (p=0.003). Baseline antihypertensive (p=0.006) and antiplatelet use (p=0.047) were associated with remodeling in symptomatic patients only. Aneurysmal degeneration was noted in 46% of all presenting lesions; none were \u22652.0 cm in maximal diameter. Incidental cases presented with more aneurysmal dilatation than symptomatic cases (59% vs. 32%, p<0.001). No celiac aneurysms at presentation grew over an average of 4.8 \u00b1 4.0 years. Forty percent and 13% of incidental and symptomatic cases without initial celiac aneurysms, respectively, developed incident aneurysms by a mean follow-up of 2.0 \u00b1 3.0 years (p=0.3). Conservative management of uncomplicated SICAD yielded excellent clinical outcomes, even with incomplete remodeling and aneurysmal degeneration, which were common, albeit largely benign. Patients may warrant screening for aneurysms beyond the celiac axis. Antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy for \u22653-6 months may promote remodeling until dissection stabilization."}

The application of xanthones and their derivatives as drug leads has been an area of intense study due to a \"privileged structure\" of the xanthone skeleton. However, cardiovascular protective activity of simple hydroxylated xanthones, a subclass of xanthones characterized by the presence of one to four hydroxyl substituents, has never been discussed to date. This review aims to provide new insights into the cardiovascular protective effect of natural and synthetic hydroxylated xanthones with a focus on their structure-activity relationship. The activity of hydroxylated xanthones on cardiovascular disease risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes and others was also discussed. The results showed that the cardiovascular protective activity of hydroxylated xanthones is dependent on the number and position of hydroxyl substituents attached to the benzene ring skeleton. Hydroxyxanthones with a higher number of hydroxyl substituents or with a presence of -OH at the C-3 position of the skeleton were found to exhibit higher activity. Recent findings revealed that the configuration of hydroxyl side groups may also be important. Furthermore, 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7) could be a promising lead for novel anti-hypertensive drugs. In conclusion, the evidence which support the use of hydroxylated xanthones as leads for novel cardioprotective, anti-atherosclerotic and anti-diabetic drugs is generally lacking in the literature. More works are warranted in these areas to clarify whether hydroxyxanthones are promising leads for novel cardiovascular drugs."}

Understanding the role of these therapeutic approaches is essential for optimizing patient outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario. This case report details the rehabilitation of a 29-year-old female with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis who developed post-tuberculosis pleural effusion. A structured physiotherapy protocol was implemented over four weeks, comprising diaphragmatic stretching, aerobic conditioning, and resistance training. Outcomes were measured through objective assessments of respiratory performance, including chest expansion and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The patient exhibited marked improvements in respiratory parameters following the intervention, with a notable increase in chest expansion and PEFR. These enhancements suggest a positive impact of targeted physiotherapy on lung mechanics and overall respiratory efficiency. This case underscores the potential benefits of incorporating diaphragmatic stretching and complementary physiotherapy techniques into the management of post-tuberculosis pleural effusion. By addressing residual pulmonary deficits, these interventions can significantly improve respiratory function and patient outcomes.

Clinically, NTM manifests as pulmonary, lymphatic, skin/soft tissue, or disseminated disease, with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and M. abscessus being predominant pathogens. Host immunity, particularly Th1 responses mediated by IL-12/IFN-\u03b3 and TLR2 signaling, is critical for controlling NTM, while dysregulated immunity (e.g., elevated Th2 cytokines, PD-1/IL-10 pathways) exacerbates susceptibility. Emerging research highlights the gut-lung axis as a pivotal mediator of disease, where microbiome dysbiosis-marked by reduced Prevotella and Bifidobacterium-impairs systemic immunity and promotes NTM progression. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbial metabolites like inosine modulate macrophage and T-cell responses, offering therapeutic potential. Studies reveal distinct airway microbiome signatures in NTM patients, characterized by enriched Streptococcus and Prevotella, and reduced diversity linked to worse outcomes.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of drug-resistant TB and its associated factors among TB patients in Dilla University Referral Hospital (DURH). A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from March-2024 to May-2024 among 216 pulmonary TB patients attending DURH. Gene Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Xpert MTB/XDR assay was used to assess the pattern of drug resistance in TB. The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay was used to detect rifampicin resistance, while the Xpert MTB/XDR assay was employed to identify isoniazid resistance and resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs when rifampicin resistance was detected. Data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. In this study, out of 216 confirmed MTB cases, 5 (2.3%) were identified as drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), with mono-resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid at 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in DR-TB prevalence between those with and without a history of anti-TB treatment (p = 0.001). Notably, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was more prevalent among individuals with diabetes mellitus and those with a history of previous treatment, showing p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively. Among the 216 confirmed TB cases, 5 cases of DR-TB were identified, accounting for 2.3%. DR-TB was more prevalent in patients with a history of anti-TB treatment, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced early detection and improved treatment monitoring. Additionally, isoniazid mono-resistant TB was notably prevalent in individuals with diabetes mellitus and prior treatment history, with p-values of 0.018 and 0.015, respectively.

However, there is no treatment against the hepatotoxic effect of INH and RIF. Therefore, it is better to focus on medicinal plants for the prevention of liver injury caused by these drugs. Cordia africana has been used traditionally as a treatment for liver related diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of aqueous extract of Cordia africana leaves against isoniazid and rifampicin-induced liver toxicity in mice. Cordia africana leaf powder was decocted in water and 30 Swiss albino mice 28.0 to 35.0 g were grouped into five groups: Group I mice were given 20 ml/kg distilled water and Group II mice were given 75mg/ kg INH and 150 mg /kg RIF body weight. Group III, group IV, and group V mice were given, 75 mg/kg INH plus 150 mg/kg RIF in addition to 200 mg/kg extract, 400 mg/kg extract, and 50 mg/kg silymarin respectively. The treatments lasted for 14 days. Blood samples were taken from each study subject for liver biochemical tests. In addition, livers were also taken for histopathological examination. Compared to Group I, Group II showed a significant increase (P<0.05) in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin. This elevation likely dictates the possibility of liver dysfunction or damage. Also, in the groups of mice that were treated with Cordia africana at a dose of 400 mg/kg and silymarin demonstrated that a marked decrease in ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin levels. This reduction indicates that both Cordia africana and silymarin might have a protective effect on liver function, especially when compared to Group II which they didn't receive such treatment. The liver index of Group IV mice showed a decrease significantly (P<0.05) compared to Group II. Besides histopathologic analysis showed that the plant extract at a higher dose did not show inflammation and showed negligible degeneration of hepatocytes and congestion in sinusoids, whereas in the negative control severe degeneration of hepatocytes and moderate inflammation were seen. From this experiment we found that the aqueous extract of Cordia africana has hepatoprotective effect against isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. This protective effect of Cordia africana extract might be due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity and could be considered a potential therapeutic option against INH and RIF induced liver injury."}

Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR, and Western blotting (WB) were performed to assess FHL2 levels in LUSC tissue microarrays (TMA) and cell lines. In vitro, CCK-8, plate colony formation, wound healing, and Matrigel Transwell assays were conducted to investigate the effects of FHL2 on LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo, xenograft tumor models were utilized to evaluate the role of FHL2 in LUSC progression. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation (IP) and proximity ligation assays (PLA) were performed to explore the interaction between FHL2 and c-Jun. The cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was conducted to assess c-Jun stability in the context of FHL2 overexpression or knockdown. The influence of differential FHL2 expression on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway was analyzed via WB. Furthermore, xenograft tumor models, WB, and IHC were employed to determine whether FHL2 mediates LUSC resistance to afatinib. FHL2 expression was significantly upregulated in LUSC tissues, as demonstrated by the TCGA database analysis and validated through IHC staining of TMA. Moreover, elevated FHL2 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in LUSC patients. FHL2 overexpression enhanced LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro while accelerating xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, FHL2 knockdown exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, FHL2 interacts with c-Jun and suppresses its ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the c-Jun protein, upregulating PDK1 expression, and subsequently activating the PAM signaling pathway. Notably, FHL2 overexpression induced afatinib resistance in LUSC cells, and patients with afatinib resistance exhibited high levels of FHL2 expression. Our results demonstrate that FHL2 promotes LUSC progression and induces afatinib resistance by regulating the PAM signaling pathway. FHL2 may serve as a crucial prognostic marker for the survival outcomes of LUSC patients and a promising therapeutic target for their treatment."}

Endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING pathway is essential for this CD8+ T cell antitumor response in MSI CRCs, suggesting that activating it in other CRCs could boost immunotherapy response rates. In contrast, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is typically associated with tumor-promoting inflammation although this has primarily been studied in immune cells. We used a mixture of flow cytometry, activation assays, in vivo orthotopic models and patient-derived organoids to investigate the effect of NLRP3 activation in CRC cells on cGAS/STING-mediated antitumor immunity. Our results show that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome specifically in CRC cells boosts cGAS/STING signaling in both MSI and non-MSI CRCs and that dual stimulation increases CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. The ability of NLRP3 to enhance cGAS/STING signaling was specific and did not occur with activation of other innate immune pathways such as AIM2 or TLRs. Enhancement of cGAS/STING signaling by NLRP3 proceeded via a positive feedback loop that was inflammasome-independent and required early crosstalk between the signaling mediators and regulation of their gene expression.

To shed light on the possible therapeutic effects of thymol in CRC based on calcium homeostasis regulation, and seek to explore the molecular pathways of calcium overload in the thymol-induced anti-CRC activity. The effects of thymol on cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis, anti-inflammatory effects, and calcium overload phenotype were investigated in HCT116 and CT26 cells. In addition, the in vivo therapeutic efficacies of thymol on CT26 xenograft tumor were also researched. Furthermore, molecular mechanisms of thymol-induced calcium overload were detected by Western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays. We demonstrated that thymol significantly inhibited the proliferation, viability, and induced apoptosis of HCT116 and CT26 cells. And, thymol suppressed the secretion of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, thymol promoted cell damage mediated by increased mitochondrial membrane potential in both two cells. In addition, thymol triggered the energy metabolism inhibition induced by calcium overload in HCT116 and CT26 cells. Besides, in vivo experiments based on CT26 xenograft tumor model also validated the positive anti-CRC activities. Thymol inhibits CRC partially through inducing calcium overload, which provides an innovative solution for developing anti-CRC drugs."}

CRC progression involves intricate molecular networks that remain incompletely understood. In this study, we conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles from CRC tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues (NATs). Our analysis revealed 1,394 differentially expressed long non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 2,788 genes, 548 proteins, and 91 metabolites. A significant interaction network comprising 22 lncRNAs, 14 mRNAs/proteins, and 9 metabolites was identified, among which lncRNA 60967.1 emerged as a pivotal regulator. Functional validation demonstrated that lncRNA 60967.1 is markedly downregulated in CRC cell lines and patient tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA 60967.1 restored expression of the tumor suppressor PLCD4 and increased levels of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). This modulation enhanced IFN-\u03b3-induced apoptosis and increased expression of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor subunit IFNGR1, thereby partially reversing IFN-\u03b3 resistance. In murine models, lncRNA 60967.1 overexpression promoted immune cell infiltration and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy to inhibit tumor growth. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel lncRNA-mRNA/protein-metabolite network, the lncRNA 60967.1-PLCD4-ATRA axis, that plays a critical role in CRC progression and immune modulation, offering promising therapeutic targets for improved treatment efficacy."}

However, the key molecules involved in shaping TAMs toward the pro-tumoral phenotype in CRLM remain unclear, limiting the development of macrophage-mediated immunotherapies for CRLM. In this study, we showed that DICER1 was highly expressed in TAMs and closely associated with M2 polarization in CRLM. Knockdown of Dicer, encoded by DICER1 in humans (or Dicer1 in mice), skewed macrophages toward an anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumor cell phagocytosis, thereby suppressing tumor growth in mice. An M2 macrophage-targeting nanosystem was developed to deliver Dicer1 siRNA for selectively downregulating Dicer expression in M2 macrophages. In situ manipulation of TAMs with the nanoparticle exerted a significant anti-tumor effect with an improved immune microenvironment in a CRLM mouse model. Macrophage depletion experiments further suggested that this effect was largely dependent on the presence of TAMs. Mechanistically, Dicer inhibition reprogrammed M2-like macrophages through downregulation of miR-148a-3p and miR-1981-5p. Our study uncovered the central role of Dicer in the M2 polarization of TAMs, in turn suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for CRLM."}

We collected data from 116 patients who underwent CRS and HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin between August 2015 and December 2018 at Hubei Cancer Hospital. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall survival (OS) and Progression-Free-Survival (PFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of inflammatory factors and tumor markers on OS and PFS. The median OS was 52.63 months (95% CI 46.02-59.25), and the median PFS was 27.03 months(95% CI 23.35-30.72). Significant differences in OS and PFS were observed between patients with NLR < 2.33 and those with NLR \u2265 2.33(65.38 vs. 44.20, p = 0.005, 35.49 vs. 21.90, p < 0.001).

Emerging frameworks emphasize the multidimensionality of sleep, but it remains unknown whether other dimensions of napping (e.g., timing, variability) are linked to neurodegeneration. To address this gap, we investigated the associations of daytime nap timing and intraindividual variability of nap duration with incident Alzheimer's dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology. We analyzed data from 936 older adults (age range: 56-99; 77% female) in the Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine incident Alzheimer's dementia and from 320 deceased participants (age range at death: 71-105; 70% female) to examine Alzheimer's pathology. The proportions of morning (9-11am) and early afternoon naps (1-3 pm) and the intraindividual variability of nap duration were assessed using actigraphy. Participants completed neurological assessments at baseline and annually for up to 17 years. In deceased participants, amyloid \u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles were examined. Here we show that more morning naps are linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer's dementia, whereas more early afternoon naps are linked to reduced amyloid \u03b2 levels. Higher intraindividual variability of nap duration is shown to be associated with increased amyloid \u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles. Our findings suggest that specific timing patterns and irregularities in daytime napping are linked to Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology. Multi-dimensional assessments of nap behaviors may aid in risk stratification for neurocognitive impairment and offer a potential target for interventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging. Research suggests that too much daytime napping is associated with adverse brain health in older adults. However, how the timing and regularity of daytime naps link to cognitive health remain unclear. We followed over 1000 older adults for up to 17 years and used wrist-worn watches to measure their nap patterns. We found that more frequent morning naps were linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Additionally, more naps in the early afternoon and more consistent nap patterns were linked to lower levels of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology.

This study characterized the care pathway for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia, including barriers to care, and considered the future treatment landscape, with the aim of making recommendations for optimizing the care pathway in readiness for the availability of new disease-modifying treatments. Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews.

Physicians from mainland China and Japan were not included. Physicians managing patients with mild cognitive impairment. Number and/or proportion of participants providing a given response, and numerical estimates provided by interview participants. Forty-four physicians, primarily neurologists (n = 31; 70.5 %), were interviewed. Participants managed a median of 67.5 patients with mild cognitive impairment per month, of whom 24.0-87.5 % had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Clinical investigations routinely comprised brief neuropsychological assessments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (n = 41), as well as neurological tests (n = 39) and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 40). Except in Korea, comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries and amyloid positron emission tomography were seldom conducted in Asia. Most patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease were treated with nootropics and/or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Korea, 96 %; all other regions, 69 %), and almost all were recommended a non-pharmacological treatment (Korea, 93 %; all other regions, 100 %). Detection of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease was considered prompt in Korea but suboptimal in other regions (n = 16) owing to low disease awareness among patients. Barriers to assessment and diagnosis included delayed healthcare visits for initial assessment (n = 7), neuroimaging backlogs (n = 6), and insufficient neuropsychology resources (n = 13). Access to amyloid biomarker tests, including amyloid positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and blood tests, was limited in regions other than Korea. The survey findings showed that screening and diagnostic processes for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in Asia require further optimization. Efforts should also be made to educate patients and caregivers, improve the diagnostic capabilities of primary and secondary healthcare providers, and reinforce cognitive screening services.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "alzheimer", "text": "Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles originating from endocytic processes, have garnered increasing attention due to their roles in both physiological functions and pathological conditions. Initially identified in the 1980 s, exosomes are formed within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through the invagination of the endosomal membrane, leading to the creation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). These ILVs can either be degraded by lysosomes or released into the extracellular space as exosomes, facilitating intercellular communication. In the nervous system, exosomes are implicated in various functions, including neural development and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This study presents a novel protocol for the isolation and proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from the substantia nigra (SN) of rat brains. By employing a combination of differential centrifugation and immunocapture techniques, we achieved a purer exosome fraction and higher exosome yield compared to traditional ultracentrifugation methods. Our proteomics analysis identified 51, 48, and 70 proteins from three distinct exosome samples (SN-EV-1, SN-EV-2, and SN-EV-4), with Gene Ontology annotation revealing their involvement in diverse biological functions. This research not only establishes a reliable method for isolating brain-derived exosomes but also sets the stage for comparative studies between healthy and neurodegenerative conditions. Ultimately, our findings aim to enhance the understanding of exosomal roles in disease mechanisms and contribute to the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders."}

Baicalein, a flavonoid compound with neuroprotective properties, has shown efficacy in clearing misfolded proteins and improving behaviors in rodent models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, its effects in ALS remain largely unexplored. This study demonstrated that baicalein treatment reduced total and misfolded SOD1 protein levels in both soluble and insoluble fractions of a motor neuron cell line overexpressing mutant SOD1. Baicalein also reduced intracellular SOD1 aggregates in cultured motor neurons transfected with SOD1/G93A, preserving neurite length. In an ALS mouse model expressing the SOD1/G93A transgene, baicalein treatment decreased mSOD1 aggregation, increased spinal motor neuron density, and reduced neuromuscular junction denervation. Furthermore, baicalein partially improved motor behaviors, as assessed by the rotarod test.

Sample characteristics such as older age, high levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) (\u2265600mg/day), and baseline cognitive impairment were found to attenuate the effect of exercise on EF. Exercise is a promising non-pharmacological intervention for enhancing EF in PD, particularly improving cognitive flexibility. Mind-body exercises appear particularly effective. Recommended programs should be moderate to vigorous in intensity, lasting 45-60minutes, and conducted at least twice weekly for 13-16 weeks. The benefits of exercise diminish with age and with LEDD exceeding 600mg/day. Additionally, PD patients with cognitive impairments may experience reduced benefits. Early exercise engagement is recommended, while disease severity and duration have minimal impact."}
{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "parkinson", "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is a key protein implicated in PD pathogenesis, with its structural and biophysical properties widely investigated due to their role in disease mechanisms. The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated \u03b1-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that \u03b1-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, \u03b1-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach. Studies suggest that berberine (BBR) may mitigate PD-related neuropathology. However, the exact mechanisms by which BBR exerts its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. This review explores the potential molecular pathways through which BBR could alleviate PD pathology."}

Apart from liver disease arising from hepatitis C viral infection, most chronic liver diseases currently have no cure. Several therapeutic alternatives, including some natural products, have been proposed to treat liver diseases. The natural product Jatropha dioica has been reported to possess antioxidant activity and, by extension, could have hepatoprotective activity. Accordingly, our aim was to test the hypothesis that an extract of J. dioica is protective against liver damage induced by valproic acid (VPA). Twelve male and twelve female Wistar rats were sorted into four groups: control, non-toxicity, valproic acid control (VPA-C), and J. dioica + VPA (JdVPA). J. dioica (300 mg/kg, given orally) was used as treatment, followed by a concomitant injection of VPA (500 mg/kg, i.p.) for the first 4 days to induce liver injury. To evaluate the severity of the injury, liver function tests were performed. In addition, oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified, as well as measures of the expression of the genes Actb, Il6, and Nfkb1. The VPA-C group showed a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malondialdehyde (MDA), a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a reduction in glutathione (GSH) vs the control group. The JdVPA group showed a significant decrease in ALT, AST, and MDA and an increase in GSH and SOD vs the VPA-C group. Gene expression of Il6 and Nfkb1 did not show any statistically significant differences between study groups. Histologically, VPA presented an inflammatory infiltrate, which decreased in the JdVPA group. The extract of J. dioica at the administered dose did not display toxicity and was capable of ameliorating the liver injury generated by VPA in biochemical and oxidative stress biomarkers, which suggests its potential hepatoprotective activity."}

However, the precise association between one lipid homeostasis indicator, remnant cholesterol (RC), and HBV-ACLF prognoses have not been fully elucidated. In this retrospective study, the relationship between RC with 28- and 90-day HBV-ACLF prognoses was delineated. 595 HBV-ACLF patients were recruited, and data collected for laboratory parameters at admission, as well as whether poor 28- and 90-day prognoses occurred during the follow-up period, in the form of mortality, or liver transplantation. Patients were divided into 3 groups, based on RC tertiles (Q1-3), and 4 multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify the associations between RC levels and ACLF prognoses; these analyses excluded different confounding factors, based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Stratified analysis was conducted to investigate the association between RC and ACLF risk among different subgroups, based on age, sex as well as complications and artificial liver treatment. RC accuracy versus that of other lipid indicators to predict 28- and 90-day ACLF survival was evaluated by restricted cubic spline and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, while Kaplan-Meier curves measured cumulative 28- and 90-day mortality risks. For all 4 regression models, higher RC were associated with worse liver function, coagulation, and HBV-ACLF prognoses. Restricted cubic spline analysis identified a non-linear relationship between RC and HBV-ACLF prognoses, in which the Q3 RC tertile had the lowest 28-day and 90-day HBV-ACLF survival rates; this was further confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, subgroup analysis found that higher RC correlated to worse ACLF prognoses among hypoproteinemia patients. Moreover, RC, compared to total cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as non-high density lipoprotein, was the most accurate in predicting poor 28- and 90-day ACLF prognoses. Elevated RC was significantly associated with poorer 28- and 90-day HBV-ACLF prognoses, even after accounting for all other traditional risk factors. Therefore, monitoring RC, along with interventions to reduce their levels, could aid in improving ACLF patient outcomes."}

Four groups were created according to the presence of HBV and/or GDM as follows: a non-HBVC & GDM group (n = 5,323), a HBVC group (n = 5,508), a GDM group (n = 919) and a HBVC & GDM group (n = 1,065). Univariate analysis was carried out with the Mann-Whitney U test or the chi-squared test; P < 0.05 was used as the screening criterion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to investigate the effects of each of the relevant confounders on HBVC, GDM and HBVC & GDM. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. The incidence of HBVC & GDM among pregnant women in Hangzhou, China was 0.96% (95% CI: 0.90-1.02%).

This study aims to explore the expression patterns and potential sources of residual viral nucleic acids following siRNA treatment in both in vitro and in vivo models, enhancing the understanding of siRNA's antiviral effects. Biochemical methods, combined with immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques, were employed to analyze the antiviral effects of siRNAs targeting the S, X, and C coding regions of HBV at the single-cell level in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cell model and rAAV8-HBV1.3 mouse model. The results indicate that, in both the in vitro and in vivo models, a single dose of siRNA treatment did not significantly reduce the proportion of cells positive for any HBV marker. Residual viral antigen and nucleic acid signals were broadly distributed across individual cells. The antiviral effects of siRNA generally exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of HBV, but vary across different viral markers, potentially due to factors such as target region, engagement, and the viral expression patterns within cells, with a potential inhibition plateau for core particle DNA. Furthermore, the combination of siRNA and the HBV core inhibitor GLS4 further reduced intracellular viral DNA in primary human hepatocytes. These findings obtained from experimental models incorporating in situ detection techniques reveal the expression patterns of residual HBV antigens and nucleic acids under siRNA treatment, deepening the understanding of its antiviral effects, while clinical complexities require further investigation."}

Efficacy data came from clinical trials, and costs were based on 2023 data from an exit survey of 94 inpatients and 464 outpatients in Bach Mai hospital. Other clinical data were also sourced from CHB patients at Bach Mai hospital. Along with deterministic analysis, two-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, threshold, and budget impact analysis were performed.ResultsCompared to TDF, TAF yielded an additional cost of USD 3,983 and an additional QALY gained of 0.14, resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 32,090 per QALY gained. The ICER exceeds the cost-effective threshold of three-time gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, that is, USD 11,348, by 2.8 times. According to one-way sensitivity analysis, ICERs were driven mainly by transition probabilities and TDF/ TAF prices. TAF would be cost-effective compared to TDF at the three-time GDP per capital threshold if TAF price were reduced by 33.4%.ConclusionsTAF is not cost-effective compared to TDF for treating chronic hepatitis B in HBeAg+ patients. The study offers relevant evidence for policymakers to consider including TAF in the social health insurance package, with a focus on price negotiation.

This study aims to evaluate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4 in DLBCL, assess the relation of their expression to different clinicopathological parameters and evaluate their prognostic significance. This retrospective study encompassed 103 cases diagnosed as de novo DLBCL. Clinicopathologic and survival data were gathered. IHC for PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4 was performed. PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4 positive reaction was observed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 68.9% (71/103), 82.5% (85/103), and 92.2% (95/103) of DLBCL cases, respectively. PD1 expression in TILs was significantly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity and prolonged overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis. LAG3 expression in TILs was significantly associated with IPI score and tended towards shorter OS (not statistically significant). LAG3 expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS). CTLA4 expression in TILs was significantly associated with advanced disease stage (III/IV). PD1 and LAG3 are expressed mainly in TILs. PD1 expression (in TILs and tumor cells) is associated with prolonged OS, while LAG3 expression (in tumor cells) is associated with shorter DFS and its expression in TILs tended towards shorter OS. CTLA4 expression is associated with advanced disease stage but not associated with OS. These findings may suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting LAG3 may offer therapeutic potential in DLBCL by enhancing the antitumor immune response. Additional research is needed to assess the effectiveness of inhibition of these checkpoint molecules in combination with existing treatment modalities."}

LncRNA ZEB1-AS1 regulates the expression of miR-365a-3p, which in turn negatively regulates NRF2 expression. Both lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 and NRF2 can bind to miR-365a-3p at the same target site. However, it remains unclear whether ZEB1-AS1 could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to reduce miR-365a-3p-mediated inhibition of NRF2. Specifically, the potential mechanism whereby ZEB1-AS1 might sequester miR-365a-3p through competitive binding, thereby alleviating its suppressive effect on NRF2 expression, requires further experimental validation. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate whether lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 could participate in the regulation of NRF2 expression through endogenous competition for binding to miR-365a-3p, as well as the role and mechanism in osteoarthritic cellular ferroptosis. Our findings demonstrated that NRF2 knockdown combined with miR-365a-3p overexpression significantly enhanced cellular ferroptosis and accelerated osteoarthritis progression. Conversely, both miR-365a-3p inhibition and ZEB1-AS1 overexpression were found to upregulate NRF2 expression, thereby mitigating cellular ferroptosis and OA development. Notably, ZEB1-AS1 overexpression exerted dual protective effects in chondrocytes by elevating NRF2 levels, effectively suppressing both ferroptosis and inflammatory damage. Mechanistically, we identified that the lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 modulates OA pathogenesis through the miR-365a-3p/NRF2 axis, suggesting this pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in OA progression."}

While an increase in hemoglobin level was associated with obesity (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.02\u20121.60), anemia was inversely negatively associated with obesity (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.12\u20120.93). This study indicates that 12% of the pregnant women in Rwanda were obese. Hemoglobin and anemia are associated with maternal obesity in Rwanda. There is a need for more efforts in nutritional programs targeting pregnant women to combat maternal obesity in Rwanda. Future research is recommended to explore the impact of maternal obesity on maternal and perinatal health."}

The study was prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on 17 June 2015 under the registration number DRKS00008759. Patients were categorized into two age-based groups: older patients (\u2265 65 years) and younger patients (< 65 years). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze factors on HRQL, including SRI scores, anemia, autonomy impairment, exacerbation history and other factors. 237 Patients with COPD with CHRF receiving NIV therapy were included. The mean SRI summary score was 49.9 \u00b1 16.8. with 23.2% (N = 55) suffering from anemia and 36.7% (N = 87) experiencing \u2265 2 exacerbations annually. Autonomy impairment was observed in 49.4% (N = 117) of patients. The updated Charlson Comorbidity Index (uCCI) was 2.2 \u00b1 1.86. No significant differences were found in SRI Summary Scale scores between age groups (p = 0.581), but notable disparities were present in the uCCI (p = 0.014). Multiple regression analysis revealed a negative association of exacerbation history (Young group: -9.2; 95% CI = -14.8/ -3.55 vs. Older group: -6.17; 95% CI = -11.91/ -0.43) and level of autonomy impairment (e.g. Level of Care 2 Young group: -13.91; 95% CI = -21.4/ -6.43 vs. Older group: -14.94; 95% CI = -22.64/ -7.24) on SRI scores with age-related differences.

This study aimed to analyze line-dependent outcomes and response patterns of lurbinectedin in SCLC patients. In this retrospective multi-center study analysis, we enrolled SCLC patients treated with lurbinectedin between January 2020 and December 2024. Patient demographics, treatment histories, and outcomes were collected from electronic medical records. Response assessment was performed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment duration were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology, with specific attention to outcomes across different lines of therapy. A total of 64 patients were enrolled, with 59 evaluable for analysis (36 males [56.3 %], median age 65 years [range 37-81]). Lurbinectedin was given as second-line therapy in 39 patients (66.1 %) and as third-line or beyond in 20 patients (33.9 %). The overall response rate (ORR) was 37.3 % (n = 22), including 1 complete response (1.7 %) and 21 partial responses (35.6 %). By line of therapy, the ORR was 38.5 % (n = 15) in second-line and 35.0 % (n = 7) in third-line or later. The median overall survival (mOS) for all evaluable patients was 7.7 months, and the median duration of treatment (mDoT) was 4.3 months. At data cutoff, 13 patients (22 %) were alive and censored in the OS analysis, with a median follow-up of 8.5 months among survivors. Prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO) exposure was documented in 71.9 % of patients (n = 46); although those with prior IO had numerically longer mOS (8.8 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.06) and mDoT (4.6 vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.14), neither difference reached statistical significance. This survival analysis included 43 patients in the prior-IO group (3 patients with prior IO were excluded due to incomplete follow-up) and 16 patients in the no-IO group. The presence of baseline brain metastases (47 %) did not preclude clinical benefit. Treatment was generally well tolerated: the most common hematologic toxicities observed were anemia (44.1 %), thrombocytopenia (37.3 %), and neutropenia (15.3 %), predominantly grade 1-2, and no grade 4 adverse events were observed. Lurbinectedin demonstrated meaningful clinical activity in second-line therapy for SCLC, while also showing durable responses in heavily pretreated cases. These findings support the consideration of lurbinectedin also beyond second-line therapy in selected SCLC patients, though larger prospective studies are needed to validate these response patterns."}

The TLR4 in the bone marrow macrophages of patients with untreated SAA were significantly higher than those in the remission and control groups, and were negatively correlated with clinical indicators. RNA sequencing of macrophages with TLR4 knockdown showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in the innate immune and inflammatory chemotaxis signaling pathways. After TLR4 knockout or TLR4 inhibitor addition in bone marrow macrophages of patients with untreated SAA, the mRNA and protein expression levels of pyroptosis markers interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18, NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin D were significantly lower than those in the control group. When CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with TLR4-knocked-down or inhibitor-added macrophages, the expression of perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced, and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity decreased.

CPOX encodes an enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) that is involved in the synthesis of heme. This study aims to report the identification of biallelic inactivating CPOX variants in three unrelated patients with PAI and their clinical characteristics. We reported three patients with childhood-onset PAI, including two patients with 46,XY DSD. All three had adrenal hypoplasia. Additionally, they commonly had severe neonatal jaundice; two of them developed skin blisters in the areas exposed to phototherapy, and two showed severe neonatal anemia requiring transfusions. Exome sequencing was performed to explore the genetic basis of the patients. The pathogenicity of the identified variants was confirmed with targeted mRNA and proteomic analyses of the patient-derived peripheral blood cells. We identified biallelic rare CPOX variants in each patient, including c.2T>G, p.Arg426*, c.1277G>A and p.Tyr429Cysfs33*. The three patients commonly had the start codon-altering c.2T>G variant. Analysis of the mRNA and proteome of peripheral blood cells from one patient (c.2T>G and p.Arg426*) showed that CPOX mRNA expression was comparable to controls, however CPOX protein expression was significantly decreased to 1%. We provided genetic evidence linking CPOX deficiency and PAI with 46,XY DSD, suggesting that the heme synthesis pathway plays an important role in human steroidogenesis."}

An etiology of SM was found in 223 (44.5%) of 501 patients with follow up. Patients with explained SM were older, had a larger spleen, and had altered biological parameters compared with patients with unexplained SM. There was a higher prevalence of non-malignant diseases than hematological malignancies (27.1% vs. 17.0%). Overall, lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) were diagnosed in 10 patients (2.0%), including 4 patients with GD (0.8%).

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "myocardial infarction", "text": "Acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are associated with increased morbidity and earlier mortality for people living with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The most common causes of PEx in CF are by bacterial infection and concomitant inflammation leading to progressive airway damage. To draw attention to the seriousness of PEx they have been labelled as 'lung attacks', much like a 'heart attack' for acute myocardial infarction. Treatment typically starts when a pwCF presents with worsening respiratory symptoms. Hence, there is a pressing need to identify indicative biomarkers of PEx onset to allow more timely intervention. Set within an ecological framework, we investigated temporal microbiota dynamics to connect changes in the lung microbiota of pwCF to changes in disease states across a PEx event. Species-time relationships (STR) describe how the richness of a community changes with time, here STRs were used to assess temporal turnover (w) within the lung microbiota of each pwCF (n = 12, mean sample duration 315.9 \u00b1 42.7 days). STRs were characterised by high interpatient variability, indicating that turnover and hence temporal organization are a personalized feature of the CF lung microbiota. Greater turnover was found to be significantly associated with greater change in lung function with time. When microbiota turnover was examined at a finer scale across each pwCF time series, w-values could clearly be observed to increase in the exacerbation period, then peaking within the treatment period, demonstrating that increases in turnover were not solely a result of perturbations caused by PEx antibiotic interventions. STR w-values have been found to have a remarkable degree of similarity for different organisms, in a variety of habitats and ecosystems, and time lengths (typically not exceeding w = 0.5). Here, we found w-values soon increased beyond that. It was therefore possible to use the departure from that expected norm up to start of treatment to approximate onset of PEx in days (21.2 \u00b1 8.9 days across the study participants). Here, we illustrate that changes in turnover of the lung microbiota of pwCF can be indicative of PEx onset in considerable advance of when treatment would normally be initiated. This offers translational potential to enable early detection of PEx and consequent timely intervention. Video Abstract."}

We employed advanced molecular techniques to investigate the upregulation of I\u03baB\u03b6 protein in mouse models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cellular oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), with a focus on nuclear localization. Our results indicate that inhibiting I\u03baB\u03b6 protein expression both in vivo and in vitro can reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and alleviate cardiac hypoxic injury. Mechanistically, I\u03baB\u03b6 influences cardiomyocyte apoptosis by binding to and regulating the activity of the intracellular signal transduction factor and transcriptional activator (STAT3). Upon AMI occurrence, the janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway is activated, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. It interacts with activated I\u03baB\u03b6 in the nucleus, resulting in decreased STAT3 activity and exacerbating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Treatment with a STAT3-specific agonist mitigated the pro-apoptotic effects caused by I\u03baB\u03b6 overexpression.

The primary endpoint was ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR), and the secondary endpoint was target lesion-related myocardial infarction (TLMI). Lesion characteristics were evaluated using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed higher ID-TLR occurrence at 5 years in the DCA+DCB group than the DCA+DES group (16.4% vs. 2.3%, P=0.027). In contrast, TLMI occurrence was similar (4.7% vs. 2.3%, P=0.667). The DCA+DCB group exhibited greater residual diameter stenosis (24.4% vs. 16.3%, P<0.001) on QCA and smaller minimum lumen area (7.33 mm\u00b2 vs. 8.42 mm\u00b2, P<0.001) and greater residual plaque area (48.9% vs. 45.3%, P=0.027) on IVUS compared to the DCA+DES group. In conclusion, the DCA+DCB strategy was associated with a higher ID-TLR incidence and a smaller luminal gain than DCA+DES. Although DCA+DCB provides a stent-less alternative, long-term monitoring is essential to address its limitations."}

Virtual monochromatic images (VMIs) of dual-energy coronary computed tomography angiography (DECCTA) provide a variety of diagnostic information with significant potential for detecting myocardial lesions. The aim of this study was to assess whether radiomics analysis in VMIs of DECCTA can help distinguish MFS from BH. A prospective cohort of patients who were suspected with an old myocardial infarction was assembled at two different centers between Janurary 2021 and June 2024. MFS and BH segmentation and radiomics feature extraction and selection were performed on VMIs images, and four machine learning classifiers were constructed using selected strongest features. Subsequently, an independent validation was conducted, and a subjective diagnosis of the validation set was provided by an radiologist. The AUC was used to assess the performance of the radiomics models. The training set included 57 patients from center 1 (mean age, 54 years +/- 9, 55 men), and the external validation set included 10 patients from center 2 (mean age, 59 years +/- 10, 9 men). The radiomics models exhibited the highest AUC value of 0.937 (expressed at 130 keV VMIs), while the radiologist demonstrated the highest AUC value of 0.734 (expressed at 40 keV VMIs). The integration of radiomic features derived from VMIs of DECCTA with machine learning algorithms has the potential to improve the efficiency of distinguishing MFS from BH."}

The occlusion of blood-supporting vessels by thrombus or emboli can contribute to massive brain cell damage, neurological deficits, and long-term disability, and in more severe conditions, results in sudden death. Current therapeutic strategies, along with rehabilitation, in part, but not completely, can restore the integrity and function of the brain. These features necessitate the advent of novel therapeutic protocols for yielding better regenerative outcomes in IS patients. In past decades, the discovery of stem cells and byproducts has led to promising results in in vitro settings and pre-clinical studies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles released from various cell types, for instance, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with certain signaling biomolecules, growth factors, and cytokines involved in cell-to-cell communication. A great plethora of studies have pointed to the fact that EVs with specific cargo can distribute easily in different parts of the body, making them appropriate therapeutics under different pathological conditions. The current review articles aimed to highlight the neuroangiogenesis properties of MSC EVs in IS conditions. How and by which mechanisms MSC EVs can orchestrate the process of nervous system regeneration is at the center of debate. We think that the current article can help us better understand MSC EVs' function in the restoration of brain function under IS conditions in terms of neurogenesis and angiogenesis."}

These impairments are not typically addressed during assessment or rehabilitation. Currently, most robotic paradigms for training of the upper limb have focused solely on improving motor function or have targeted proprioception in individuals with combined use of visual feedback. Our goal was to design a training paradigm that directly targets proprioception of the upper limb, while minimizing reliance on other sensory information to improve sensorimotor function after stroke. In this pilot study, 5 individuals with stroke and 5 age-matched controls were tested on a single-day proprioceptive training paradigm. Here, participants used a joystick with their less-affected arm to send commands to a KINARM exoskeleton that would passively move their more-affected arm. To complete the passive reaching task, participants relied only on proprioceptive feedback from the more-affected arm and were only given knowledge of results information after each trial. Sensorimotor function of the upper limb was measured pre- and post-training via robotic measures of motor function [Visually Guided Reaching (VGR)] and position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)]. Sensorimotor function was quantified as a Task Score, which incorporated multiple task-relevant parameters for both VGR and APM. Changes in sensorimotor performance due to training were calculated as the pre- to post-training difference for VGR and APM within the control and stroke groups. We found significant improvements from pre-training to post-training for VGR in individuals with stroke (p < 0.001, CLES = 100) that were not observed in control participants (p = 0.87, CLES = 80). We observed significant changes from pre- to post-training in both VGR (Posture Speed, Reaction Time, Initial Direction Angle, Min-Max Speed Difference, and Movement Time) and APM (Contraction/Expansion Ratio Our novel proprioceptive training paradigm is one of the first to implement a self-guided sensory training protocol.

A cohort of 449 asymptomatic T2DM patients was categorized into four groups: those without DN(G0) and those with DN, which was further subdivided into stages G1, G2, and G3. Through 4D-Auto LAQ analysis, we quantified the left atrial (LA) volume as well as the longitudinal and circumferential strains during the reservoir, conduit, and contraction phases. Additionally, we investigated the association between LA volume, strain parameters, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Among the participants, 190 patients in the DN group were followed up. The primary endpoint for follow-up was defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, or cardiac death.

The objective of this research was to explore the roles and underlying mechanisms of the circDnajc1/miR-27a-5p/C1qc signaling pathway in the development of ischemia stroke. For in vitro experiments, an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model was established following neuron-microglia co-culture. circDnajc1 siRNA and pcDNA3.1-circDnajc1 overexpression vectors were constructed and transfected into primary microglia. For in vivo experiments, an MCAO/R rat model was established. The molecular mechanisms were investigated using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro experiments showed that circDnajc1-induced cellular activation following microglia OGD/R injury, promoted the release of inflammatory factors, downregulated miR-27a-5p, upregulated C1qc, C3, and C5ar, and promotes neuronal apoptosis after microglia OGD/R injury. Interference with circDnajc1 reversed these effects. In vivo experiments, circDnajc1 knockdown exerted a protective effect on neurons in MCAO/R rats and inhibited microglial activation and the release of inflammatory factors. Consistent with the in vitro experiments, circDnajc1 regulated on the expression of downstream target genes of miR-27a-5p, C1qc, C3, and C5ar. CircDnajc1 plays a critical role in ischemia stroke and may influence nervous system homeostasis by regulating the circDnajc1/miR-27a-5p/C1qc signaling axis, which promotes microglia activation and regulates inflammatory factor release and neuronal apoptosis."}

With the exoskeleton, stroke survivors stood up significantly faster (8.8% reduction in stand-up time), more symmetrically (13.7% increase in weight-bearing symmetry), and with less effort on their affected side (32% reduction in peak quadriceps muscle activation, 25% reduction in peak biological torque generation). The exoskeleton effectively supplemented the lack of strength in their affected knee, increasing the total knee torque by 59%, which more closely matched their non-affected knee.

Compared with warfarin, edoxaban offers non-inferior thromboembolic protection with a lower risk of major bleeding. However, with the increasing clinical use of edoxaban, reports of serious adverse events (AEs) have emerged, necessitating a comprehensive safety assessment. A comprehensive systematic literature search of 6 databases was conducted until December 2024. Case reports of serious AEs were included. Data extraction was performed using a structured Excel-based data collection form. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to summarize the characteristics of the cases. 41 cases of serious AEs met the inclusion criteria. 26 involved severe bleeding events, whereas 2 cases involved thrombotic events. 7 patients had medication errors. P-glycoprotein inhibitors were co-administered in 9 cases, contributing to increased bleeding risk, while P-gp inducers were used in 2 cases, potentially reducing edoxaban efficacy. The median time to AE onset was within one month in 18 cases, but 1 case occurred after four years of therapy. 6 patients died, of whom 4 deaths were attributed to AEs. This study highlights the clinical risks associated with edoxaban, particularly in elderly patients, those with impaired renal function, and those receiving concomitant P-gp inhibitors. In addition to confirming previously known risk factors, this study provides practical prescribing insights by synthesizing real-world evidence on medication errors, inappropriate co-administration, and off-label use.

We present a multimodal approach integrating intraoperative thalamic and sub-scalp electroencephalogram recordings with post-implant reconstructions to define neural targets affected by centromedian nucleus stimulation. We find that stimulating low-activity regions near the centromedian nucleus, particularly the white matter of internal medullary lamina, induces significant cortical delta power increases greater than stimulation within high-activity areas inside the nucleus. Implantation in these low-activity targets results in greater than 50% seizure reduction in all three subjects.

Our work discovers that diosgenin, a natural steroid sapogenin, distinct from its classic cardioprotective effects, directly stimulates OPCs maturation predominantly in the corpus callosum, assuring CNS myelin recovery. To study the action of diosgenin on CNS myelin repair, we developed a pilocarpine mouse model of epilepsy and an in vitro seizure model. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and molecular docking map were employed to clarify the target and underlying mechanism of diosgenin on myelin repair promotion. Diosgenin greatly fostered OPCs differentiation in the corpus callosum. Of note, this action of diosgenin on OPCs was via targeting and stabilizing 122\u223c221 amino acid residues of GLUR2 subunit, thereby disrupted its interaction with GAPDH protein and subsequent GAPDH nucleus translocation in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that diosgenin acted as a direct GLUR2 ligand, thereby enhanced the intrinsic differentiation capacities of OPCs by blunting GLUR2/GAPDH interaction and highlighted that diosgenin may serve as a promising natural compound for the remission of CNS demyelination in epilepsy condition."}
{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "glaucoma", "text": "The desire for permanent cosmetic change of eye color has driven the development of various surgical techniques aimed at achieving this transformation, pursuing more enduring solutions. This demand has led to the emergence of three primary surgical approaches: cosmetic iris implants, laser iris depigmentation, and cosmetic keratopigmentation (KTP). Each technique presents distinct advantages, yet also entails specific limitations and potential risks. Cosmetic iris implants, originally designed for congenital or traumatic iris defects, have been repurposed for aesthetic use. However, they come with severe risks, including glaucoma, corneal endothelial cell loss, and even permanent vision impairment. As a result of these complications, they are not approved by major regulatory bodies and are widely considered unsafe. Laser iris depigmentation offers a less invasive approach, using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser to remove melanin from the anterior iris stroma. While it provides a natural-looking result, it lacks customization and has potential complications like patchy pigmentation, photophobia, and temporary intraocular pressure spikes. Additionally, there is limited long-term data on its safety. Cosmetic KTP, an advanced version of corneal tattooing, has emerged as the safest and most effective option. It involves embedding micronized mineral pigments into the cornea, allowing for precise, customizable, and long-lasting results. Studies show high patient satisfaction and minimal risks when properly performed. Among these techniques, KTP appears to be the best choice owing to its safety and aesthetic flexibility, while cosmetic iris implants should be avoided because of their high risk of complications, and laser iris depigmentation deals with limitations in color selection and long-term reliability. While KTP currently seems the safest option for cosmetic eye color change, this is largely based on limited single-center data and should be confirmed by larger studies in the future."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "glaucoma", "text": "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with an estimated 112 million people projected to be affected by 2040. The primary risk factor for POAG is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which is primarily driven by increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow through the conventional outflow pathway. Despite its prevalence, the precise biomechanical mechanisms underlying this resistance remain unclear. In this study, we utilized 3D in situ traction force microscopy to investigate the effects of the rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 and the YAP/TAZ inhibitor Verteporfin treatments on the trabecular meshwork (TM) and juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) cellular contractility and their extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization in both normal and glaucomatous human donor eyes. Our analysis revealed dysregulated traction forces within glaucomatous tissues, leading to significant ECM reorganization that may contribute to disrupting the homeostasis of the aqueous outflow pathway. Treatments appear to help restore normal ECM structure by adjusting cellular forces. The effect on contractile forces differed between genders, suggesting the significance of gender in treatment response. Our results suggest that targeting these biomechanical pathways may offer new therapeutic strategies to reduce outflow resistance, laying the groundwork for future therapies aimed at preserving vision by restoring ECM biomechanics and improving outflow."}

The diagnosis and management of POAG involves tests such as static perimetry, tonometry and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to track progressive structural and functional changes. All these methods have limitations. Advancements in the discovery of metabolomic plasma-derived biomarkers may improve clinical outcomes, through identifying susceptible individuals, predicting disease progression, and assessing treatment efficacy in POAG. We reviewed the current state of POAG management, identified limitations and need for biomarkers that could potentially fill the gap and current landscape of POAG plasma metabolomics, providing an overview of future potential biomarkers. Advances in the identification of metabolomic biomarkers can improve current clinical practices. These biomarkers can complement existing diagnostic tools, allowing for earlier detection and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges remain, including a lack of standardization in metabolomics protocols, variability in disease progression and finally, recording treatment non-response currently also suffers from a lack of standardization toward depicting treatment outcomes. Future research should focus on standardizing procedures, increasing diversity in study populations, and conducting longitudinal studies to validate biomarkers in clinical settings."}

This study aimed to compare the protein profile of extracellular vesicles derived from TMSCs and TM cells for a better understanding of their potential as a cell-free therapeutic agent for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Proteins were isolated from TM and TMSC sEV samples (n = 3 each) and proteomic profiling was carried out by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 2802 proteins in TMSC sEV and 2848 in TM sEV. Differential expression analysis identified distinct protein profiles between TMSC and TM sEV. Notably, sEV from TMSCs were enriched with proteins associated with wound healing, cell proliferation, migration, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities, consistent with the findings in other mesenchymal stem cells. Pathway analysis highlighted the enrichment of proteins associated with PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Further validation by western blotting confirmed that TMSC sEV effectively modulated these pathways in TM cells, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival under oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive protein profiling of TMSC-derived sEV, demonstrating the presence of functional proteins and their capacity to regulate the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways in the recipient TM cells.

The two most important risk factors for glaucoma are ocular hypertension (OHT) and advanced age. In this study, we explored the combined impact of aging and OHT on retinal neuronal and microvasculature health. We induced OHT using the bead-injection model in 12 week old (young) and 1.5 year old (old) mice and monitored intraocular pressure (IOP) for 2 weeks. We then explored vascular phenotypes, blood retinal barrier components, RGC counts, and electroretinogram (ERG) changes. Aged mice displayed reduced retinal microvasculature complexity, retinal vascular phenotypes in all three retinal capillary plexi (RCPs), and abnormal ERGs. Aging also impacted basement membrane (BM) and tight junction (TJ) morphology. The impact of OHT was much more evident in old mice; RGC loss was exacerbated, retinal vascular phenotypes were magnified across all three RCPs, and BM and TJ phenotypes were much more severe. However, the impact of OHT on retinal function was unchanged in old mice. Interestingly, the nature of these phenotypes was not equivalent among all RCPs, suggesting regional shared and distinct susceptibilities to aging and OHT. Taken together, aging causes multiple neurovascular phenotypes in mouse retinas, and OHT causes more severe effects in old mice. This suggests an interaction between aging and OHT that may help explain the increased prevalence of glaucoma in older humans."}

This study reveals significant differences in the occurrence of several non-communicable health conditions between White European and South Asian women. The observed higher incidence of several conditions in South Asian women, consistent with established knowledge regarding elevated risks for diseases such as diabetes, likely reflects the complex interplay of social, cultural, lifestyle, environmental, and genetic determinants. These findings emphasise the need for culturally sensitive and targeted public health interventions aimed at addressing modifiable risk factors at both the individual and systemic levels to alleviate the burden of long-term health conditions and reduce existing health inequalities.

Subgingival plaque from 135 patients (41 healthy, 47 gingivitis, 47 periodontitis) was analysed by V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Sequences were probabilistically assigned to unambiguous taxon groups (UTGs) using advanced bioinformatics. Beyond univariate analyses across health groups, samples were re-classified into microbiota patterns using unsupervised clustering. Bacterial community ordination was performed via correlation analysis. In total, 394 fully characterized UTGs were detected with a confidence level of at least 98% in all samples, with an average of 157 in each sample and 162 representing more than 95% of the bacteriome. Hierarchical clustering identified 10 UTG complexes, with 1 particularly associated with health (Complex 6) and 1 with disease (Complex 10). Complex 10 corresponded to 29 taxa, among which the three species from Socransky's red complex and additional 8 Treponema UTGs, as well as species from the orange complex. Complex 6 comprised species from Socransky's green, yellow and purple complexes. While gingivitis appeared as an intermediate state between health and periodontitis, k-clustering revealed five microbiota patterns related to disease progression, and with specific contributions of bacterial complexes, evidencing alternative pathophysiological routes. These 10 new complexes offer an entry point to understanding plaque ecology, beyond the complexity of microbial dynamics in the periodontal microenvironments revealed by the variability within these groups and the existence of 'boundary taxa' linking them. These microbial complexes co-exist in specific microenvironments, and shifts in their relative abundance mark the transition from a healthy microbiota to a diseased microbiota, with intermediary patterns in between.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the composition of the microbial association of the periodontal pocket in patients exhibiting varying degrees of periodontal tissue damage. The microbiologic composition of periodontal pocket contents was studied in a cohort of 34 patients diagnosed with K05.3 Chronic periodontitis. The state of periodontal tissues was evaluated using clinical, instrumental, and radiologic examination methods. The contents of the periodontal pocket were utilized as a subject for examination. The primary identification of microorganisms was carried out by means of the MALDI TOF MS method. The results of the study indicated the presence of various indicators of microbial composition in patients exhibiting different degrees of periodontal tissue lesions.

As the severity of the disease worsened, there was a shift towards an increase in the number of obligate microorganisms and a decrease in species diversity."}
{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "gingivitis", "text": "Sex hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, undergo continuous fluctuations throughout a woman's life, beginning at puberty and extending through the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. These hormonal variations significantly influence gingival health, leading to various periodontal conditions. During puberty, elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone enhance blood circulation to the gingival tissues, increasing their sensitivity to plaque and resulting in puberty gingivitis. This condition is characterized by gingival enlargement, redness, and bleeding. Throughout the menstrual cycle, hormonal fluctuations can cause menstrual gingivitis, presenting as inflamed and bleeding gums, typically occurring prior to menstruation and subsiding thereafter. Pregnancy induces substantial hormonal changes, with heightened estrogen and progesterone levels exacerbating gingival inflammation. This often leads to pregnancy gingivitis, marked by swelling, bleeding, and tenderness of the gums. In some cases, a localized overgrowth known as a pyogenic granuloma or \"pregnancy tumor\" may develop on the gingiva. The use of oral contraceptives, which alter hormonal levels, has been associated with increased gingival inflammation and exudate, similar to the effects observed during pregnancy. Menopause brings a significant decline in estrogen levels, leading to various oral health issues such as dry mouth (xerostomia), a burning sensation in the mouth, and an increased risk of osteoporosis affecting the alveolar bone supporting the teeth. These changes contribute to a heightened susceptibility to periodontal diseases in post-menopausal women. The influence of estrogen and progesterone on the immune response, oral microbial composition, bone density, and enzymes like collagenase plays a crucial role in modulating gingival inflammation and the risk of periodontal diseases. Understanding these hormonal impacts is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for maintaining optimal gingival health in women across different life stages."}

An accurate understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of endometriosis is essential for disease control and prevention. We aimed to use the latest data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 to comprehensively analyze the various epidemiological indicators of surgically confirmed endometriosis and their changing trends to better measure the disease burden and help improve health management. We delineated incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) of surgically confirmed endometriosis at the global, regional, and national levels. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess temporal trends in the age-standardized rate (ASR). In addition, we used joinpoint regression models to describe local trends in these indicators, assessed the correlation between disease burden and Socio-demographic index (SDI) levels, and used decomposition analysis to quantitatively analyze the driving factors leading to changes in disease burden. Globally, the age-standardized rate of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of surgically confirmed endometriosis all showed a decreasing trend from 1990 to 2021. The burden of surgically confirmed endometriosis is mainly concentrated in women aged 20-30 years and declines with increasing SDI levels. The results of the decomposition analysis indicated that population growth is the main driving factor for the upward in the number of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs cases of endometriosis worldwide. The overall burden of endometriosis has decreased globally from 1990 to 2021, but there are regional disparities. Managing this condition remains a major challenge, and more refined policies and interventions are needed to effectively address the burden of endometriosis."}

Currently, about 10% of all women worldwide experience this disease, but scientists have not determined its natural causes. Importantly, the development of endometriosis depends significantly on the dysfunction of the immune system, which results in impaired macrophage activity. Specifically, endometriotic lesions contain M2-like macrophages, supporting tissue reconstruction along new blood vessel formation and evading immune responses. Moreover, the survival of lesions and the processes of neurogenesis and inflammation depend on the actions of macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as well as cytokines and growth factors. In this context, this review investigates the process of macrophage polarization and details the cellular interactions found in endometriotic tissue environments and their therapeutic capacity. Ultimately, understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease will facilitate the development of immunomodulatory therapies aimed at reducing symptoms and improving clinical outcomes."}

This was a retrospective observational case series conducted by three minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons (X.G., T.K., B.T.) at a single tertiary care center between August 2021 and January 2025. A total of 92 patients underwent RALS using ICG fluorescence; 44 surgeries were performed by two junior surgeons, and 48 by a senior surgeon. The senior group had a higher percentage of patients with complete cul-de-sac obliteration (56.3% vs. 18.2%, p = 0.001). Our primary surgical outcome, total operative time, was 233 min in the junior group and 348 min in the senior group, initially showing a significant difference. However, after adjusting for factors such as history of prior abdominal surgery, cul-de-sac obliteration, and additional procedures (resection of ovarian remnant, bowel shaving, oophorectomy, enterolysis) using multivariable linear regression analysis, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Other perioperative outcomes-including patient characteristics, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain at weeks 1, 2, and 3-were comparable between the groups. Complication rates did not differ significantly. Notably, there were no cases of temporary or permanent ureteral injury in either group. These findings suggest that with ICG-assisted ureteral mapping, junior surgeons can achieve comparable surgical outcomes to senior surgeons. ICG facilitates intraoperative ureter identification, with the potential to enhance surgical safety by improving surgical precision and supporting the training of junior surgeons in managing complex endometriosis."}

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "endometriosis", "text": "Endometriosis is a serious multifocal condition that can involve various pelvic structures, with Pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration being a significant clinical indicator for diagnosis. To circumvent the need for invasive diagnostic procedures like laparoscopy, research has increasingly focused on imaging-based methods such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The limited diagnostic accuracy achieved through manual interpretation of these imaging techniques has driven the development of automated classifiers that can effectively utilize both modalities. However, patients often undergo only one of these two examinations, resulting in unpaired data for training and testing POD obliteration classifiers, where TVUS models tend to be more accurate than MRI models, but TVUS scanning are more operator dependent. This prompts a crucial question: Can a model be trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data to enhance the performance of a model exclusively trained with MRI, while maintaining the high accuracy of the model individually trained with TVUS? In this paper we aim to answer this question by proposing a novel multi-modal POD obliteration classifier that is trained with unpaired TVUS and MRI data and tested using either MRI or TVUS data. Our method is the first POD obliteration classifier that can flexibly take either the TVUS or MRI data, where the model automatically focuses on the uterus region within MRI data, eliminating the need for any manual intervention. Experiments conducted on our endometriosis dataset show that our method significantly improves POD obliteration classification accuracy using MRI from AUC=0.4755 (single-modal training and testing, without automatically focusing on the uterus region) to 0.8023 (unpaired multi-modal training and single modality MRI testing, with automatic uterus region detection), while maintaining the accuracy using TVUS with AUC=0.8921 (single modality TVUS testing using either an unpaired multi-modal training or a single-modality training)."}

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been implicated in the progression of endometriosis, though the precise mechanisms remain largely undefined. Among EDCs, elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-126 have been strongly associated with endometriosis, particularly in patients with deep infiltrating disease. In a mouse model of endometriosis, PCB-126 exposure significantly promoted the growth of ectopic lesions by activating the Steroid Receptor Coactivator-1 (SRC-1) isoform/Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9)/Estrogen Receptor-\u03b2 (ER\u03b2) axis, a key driver of disease progression. PCB-126 also enhanced ER\u03b2 activity via upregulation of the AXL Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (AXL)/Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) signaling pathway in endometriotic lesions. Notably, BMS-777607, an AXL inhibitor, effectively suppressed lesion growth in this model. Moreover, the PCB-126/ER\u03b2 axis directly increased expression of DNA Methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), contributing to inflammation and immune dysregulation in endometriotic tissue. Collectively, these findings suggest that PCB-126 promotes endometriosis progression through coordinated activation of the AXL/ER\u03b2/DNMT3A axis, driving estrogen-mediated epigenetic and immunoinflammatory responses."}

Specifically, it compared ovarian responses between a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol, used as a conventional controlled ovarian stimulation method, and a progesterone-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol, considered a relatively new method. This retrospective, observational study was conducted at a single in vitro fertilization clinic in Tokyo, Japan, from April 2022 to March 2024. The study population included infertile patients who were scheduled for treatment and met the inclusion criteria. Eligible participants were Japanese women aged 20-45 years with preserved ovarian function, indicated by an anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone level of \u22650.8 ng/mL. Exclusion criteria included contraindications for follitropin delta, previous oocyte stimulation for egg donation or fertility preservation, follicle-stimulating hormone levels \u226535 mIU/mL, uncontrolled malignant disease, stage III/IV endometriosis, and the use of hormone preparations (excluding thyroid medication) during the last menstrual cycle prior to study entry. The primary endpoint was the pregnancy rate per transfer in GnRH antagonist and PPOS cycles. Secondary endpoints included the number of oocytes retrieved and the blastocyst formation rate. Ongoing pregnancy was defined as a pregnancy in which a fetal heart rate was confirmed by 10 weeks of gestation. Accumulated data from GnRH antagonist cycles and PPOS cycles at the institution were combined to compare oocyte retrieval outcomes and pregnancy rates per transfer. Additionally, a stratified analysis by age (<35, 35-39, and \u226540 years) was performed. Accumulated data included 149 GnRH antagonist cycles and 147 PPOS cycles. Oocyte retrieval outcomes and pregnancy rates per transfer were compared between the two protocols. There was no significant difference in the number of oocytes retrieved. However, the number of blastocysts showed a higher trend in the PPOS group compared to the GnRH antagonist group (p = 0.065). Across all age groups, the PPOS cycle tended to yield higher numbers of retrieved oocytes and blastocysts. Nonetheless, no significant difference was observed in the pregnancy rate per transfer between the two protocols. Both the GnRH antagonist and PPOS protocols demonstrated trends toward higher numbers of retrieved oocytes and blastocysts, with comparable pregnancy rates across all age groups, suggesting similar clinical outcomes. A key limitation of this study is its retrospective design at a single institution; therefore, future prospective, large-scale studies are warranted."}

The study cohort consisted of 49 newly diagnosed treatment-na\u00efve adult patients (13 Crohn's disease (CD), 13 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 23 IBS) and 12 healthy individuals. Inflammatory and metabolism-related serum proteins were assessed using PEA multiplex panels, while gut microbiota composition was determined by 16 s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Serum proteins AXIN1, TNFSF14, RNASE3, EN-RAGE, OSM, ST1A1, CA13 and NADK were identified as markers with the most promising specificity/sensitivity and predictivity between healthy and disease groups, while IL-17A and TNFRSF9 enabled differentiation between IBD and IBS patients. Increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was associated with protein markers significantly elevated in IBD/IBS. In contrast, depletion of beneficial taxa like Ruminococcaceae and Verucomicrobiaceae (i.e. Akkermansia muciniphila) was associated with decrease of a set of markers in diseased groups. Differences in the abundance of Turicibacteriaceae were more predictive to discern CD from UC than any of the serum proteins investigated. By using a broad panel of inflammation and metabolism-related proteins, we determined serum markers with significantly different levels in treatment-na\u00efve IBD and IBS patients compared to healthy individuals, as well as between IBD and IBS.

To ensure the robustness of causal estimates, we applied multiple MR methods and extensive sensitivity analyses. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step mediation analyses were performed to explore direct causal effects and potential mediating factors. After multiple-testing correction, genetic liability to mood instability was significantly associated with an increased risk of four GI disorders: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticular disease, and cholelithiasis. Reverse MR analysis further suggested that genetically predicted GERD and IBS also increased the risk of mood instability. These findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses and were validated in independent datasets. Moreover, MVMR and mediation analyses indicated that smoking and depression may partially mediate the causal effects on GERD. Mood instability, as a personality trait, may play a causal role in the development of multiple GI disorders. Our findings suggest that behavioral interventions, such as smoking cessation, may help reduce GI risk among individuals prone to mood instability.

This study introduces the Incremental Burst Sequence (IBS) method to induce the population of polydisperse targeted MBs to burst progressively, achieving MBs spatial separation and enabling high-resolution USMI (HR-USMI) localization. IBS method employs interleaved imaging and bursting pulses, with transmit voltages of bursting pulses incrementally increased to produce a gradual rise in the acoustic pressure. IBS is first validated optically in vitro using a cellulose tubing phantom, and MB remaining count during IBS is measured. Thereafter, in vivo validation is performed in a murine tumor model, and the intra-tumoral targeted MB signal intensity is measured during IBS. Furthermore, high frame-rate data for SRUS and IBS data for HR-USMI are acquired from a single bolus injection of MBs to generate composite images with high-resolution molecular signatures superimposed on the tumor microvasculature. Both in vitro and in vivo results validate the technical feasibility of the proposed IBS method. In addition, we demonstrate that higher bursting pulse repetitions lead to a faster disruption of the MB population during IBS. Finally, HR-USMI signals localized within a 50 \u03bcm \u00d7 50 \u03bcm grid are aligned with microvessels resolved better than 100 \u03bcm, presenting a combination of molecular signatures and anatomical structures at fine resolution."}

Additionally, it accounts for potential model misspecification, ensuring robustness across a wide range of settings. We assess the performance of CoxTL through extensive simulation studies, considering data under various types of distributional shifts. Additionally, we apply CoxTL to predict End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in the Hispanic population using electronic health record-derived features from the All of Us Research Program. Data from non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations are leveraged as source cohorts. Model performance is evaluated using the C-index and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). In simulation studies, CoxTL demonstrates higher predictive accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving multi-level heterogeneity between target and source datasets. In other scenarios, CoxTL performs comparably to alternative methods specifically designed to address only a single type of distributional shift. For predicting the 2-year risk of ESRD in the Hispanic population, CoxTL achieves an increase in C-index up to 6.76% compared to the model trained exclusively on target data. Furthermore, it demonstrates up to 17.94% increase in the C-index compared to the state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on Cox model.

Data for this retrospective cohort study were sourced from 746,060 individuals in the NHIS-NSC database, classified according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD) version 6, based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The drugs were also identified by their GNL code in Korea. We focused on individuals diagnosed with rosacea and their subsequent development of IBS. This study was conducted with 1,087 patients diagnosed with Rosacea between 2002 and 2013 in NHIS-NSC. A total of 4,348 controls were matched at 1:4 based on sex, age, and index data. Adjustments were made for potential confounders such as age, sex, and comorbidities through multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, to assess the risk of IBS among patients with rosacea compared to those without it. Our findings show that individuals with rosacea have a significantly higher incidence of IBS than those without rosacea. After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, the association remained significant, with rosacea patients showing a 21% increased risk of developing IBS compared to controls. The study also noted that the incidence of IBS increased as rosacea became chronic. The findings support the hypothesis that rosacea may be associated with an increased risk of IBS, potentially mediated by systemic inflammatory pathways and neurological interactions as suggested by the gut-skin axis. This indicates that gastrointestinal symptoms and diseases should be considered when managing rosacea patients. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of this association and to confirm these findings in other populations."}

Metronidazole (MET), a commonly prescribed antibiotic for treating anaerobic infections, has been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota (GM), which in turn are associated with various adverse side effects in the host. Recent studies have shown that the GM plays a key role in regulating bone homeostasis, though the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that MET promotes inflammatory osteoporosis through gut dysbiosis, with Klebsiella variicola (K. variicola) identified as a major pathogen influencing bone metabolism. The pro-inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by K. variicola induce enhanced inflammatory responses and osteoclastic differentiation in both bone macrophages and bone tissue. Notably, the use of antibiotics that target K. variicola effectively mitigates MET-induced bone loss in vivo. This study expands our understanding of the mechanisms underlying antibiotic-induced bone loss and underscores the significant role of the pathogenic bacterium K. variicola in the development of osteoporosis, providing new avenues for future research on the microbiota-gut-bone axis in bone-related diseases."}

This study aimed to develop a functional food by promoting osteogenesis through the synergistic effects of compound plant extracts (CPE) and Lactobacillus plantarum. First, it was determined that CPE could promote the growth, metabolic activity, biofilm formation, calcium enrichment, and antioxidant properties of L. plantarum, improving the bioavailability of calcium. Cell experiments showed that the combined application of CPE and L. plantarum (CPEL) significantly promoted the proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, CPEL activated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and BMP2/Smad signaling pathways, which are essential for bone formation. The multi-omics integration of metabolomics and molecular docking revealed key metabolic changes, particularly in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways, contributing to enhanced osteogenic activity. Molecular docking also clarified the strong binding interactions between differential metabolites (leucine, salicylic acid, and fumaric acid) and osteogenic targets, providing new insights into plant component-microbe synergy in functional food development. The combined application of CPE and L. plantarum could promote bone formation through multiple targets and pathways. These findings highlight the potential of plant extract-probiotic synergy in developing functional foods for bone health, offering a promising dietary strategy to prevent osteoporosis. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."}

In the context of various chronic pathologies, this condition may present an even higher prevalence, impacting morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden. To synthesize and compare available evidence from systematic reviews on the prevalence of osteoporosis across different chronic diseases. An umbrella review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis) reporting prevalence data of osteoporosis in adults with at least one chronic disease. Databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE, were searched, covering publications between 2009 and 2023, without language restrictions. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction, resolving discrepancies through consensus. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the ROBIS tool. Prevalence estimates reported in each review were analyzed, classifying diseases according to the magnitude of the percentages found. Thirteen systematic reviews were evaluated (twelve included meta-analyses). The highest prevalence of osteoporosis was observed in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (up to 36.8%) and diabetes mellitus (approximately 27.7%). Other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, liver cirrhosis, and celiac disease, showed variable prevalence but were equally relevant in clinical terms. Methodological heterogeneity, both in diagnostic criteria and populations, was a notable factor. The results highlight the need for systematic assessment of bone health in patients with chronic diseases, particularly those with a higher prevalence of osteoporosis.

This study delved into the impacts of gastrointestinal stress on S. boulardii and the corresponding adaptive mechanisms employed by the yeast at the membrane level using physiological methodologies. The findings demonstrated that exposure to gastrointestinal stress compromised cellular integrity, resulting in cell wall rupture and the subsequent leakage of intracellular contents. To mitigate the adverse effects of gastrointestinal stress, S. boulardii activated several membrane-associated defense strategies. Notably, there was a decrease in membrane fluidity, and significant alterations in fatty acid composition, including a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, intracellular ergosterol and glutathione levels were substantially elevated, contributing to the stabilization of the cell membrane and minimizing damage caused by gastrointestinal stress. Taken together, the comprehensive analysis presented in this study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in S. boulardii. These results support the enhancement of the application of probiotics in osteoporosis, especially for oral administration requiring resistance to gastrointestinal stress."}

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a novel dual-parameter optimized ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT) protocol for quantitative BMD assessment in the lumbar spine, comparing its radiation dose, image quality, and diagnostic performance against standard-dose CT (SD-CT). In this prospective study, 245 patients undergoing lumbar surgery received paired pre- and postoperative CT scans: SD-CT (120kV/250mAs) and ULD-CT (100kV/30mAs). Radiation dose metrics (CTDIvol, DLP, effective dose [ED]), objective image quality (noise, SNR, CNR), and subjective quality (5-point Likert scale) were analyzed. Volumetric BMD (vBMD) was measured using QCT and classified per American College of Radiology criteria (normal, osteopenia, osteoporosis). Diagnostic performance was evaluated via sensitivity/specificity and ROC analysis. ULD-CT reduced radiation dose by 92.5% compared to SD-CT (ED: 0.88 vs. 11.68 mSv; CTDIvol: 1.93 vs. 25.66 mGy, both P < 0.001). While SD-CT demonstrated superior objective (P=0.001-0.01) and subjective image quality (P<0.001), ULD-CT maintained diagnostic acceptability (scores \u22653; interobserver ICC=0.73). ULD-CT showed slight BMD overestimation but no significant differences in gender, age, or osteoporosis subgroups (P>0.05). ROC analysis revealed high diagnostic accuracy for ULD-CT (AUC: 0.986-0.996), with sensitivity/specificity of 94.74-100% and 95.74-98.01%, respectively. The dual-parameter ULD-CT protocol achieves substantial radiation reduction (92.5%) while preserving the image quality and diagnostic accuracy for osteoporosis classification, offering a safer alternative for longitudinal BMD monitoring without compromising clinical utility."}

The FLS was associated with an additional cost of $50 and a gain of 0.03 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1663 per QALY, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a FLS program compared to current practice in Iran, from a societal perspective. The target population was patients aged 50 years or older with recent sentinel fragility fractures. Data were collected using various resources, including previously published literature, treatment guidelines, and hospitals. A state-based microsimulation model with a lifetime horizon was designed to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Treatment pathways for patients under current practice and FLS were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). For patients aged 50 years and older with a sentinel fragility fracture, FLS was associated with an incremental cost of $50 and a gain of 0.03 QALYs compared to current practice. Consequently, the ICER was estimated at $1663 per QALY gained, which is below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of one GDP per capita ($4466 per QALY). Simulations showed that comparing the current practice, FLS could prevent 59 new fractures and 10 related deaths per 1000 patients. The one-way sensitivity analysis indicated that treatment efficacy and medication costs exert the greatest influence on the ICER. The findings of this study demonstrate that FLS is cost-effective compared to current practice in Iran. Given the significant prevalence of osteoporosis and the increasing aging population in Iran, these results underscore the potential of FLS to enhance patient outcomes."}

Studies have highlighted the significant role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the survival of leukemia patients. However, the heterogeneity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and their impact on clinical correlation in the peripheral blood of patients with DLBCL remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed on 9 blood samples, sourced from 6 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 3 healthy individuals (HIs), to delineate clinically pertinent \u03b3\u03b4 T cell states and subsets in DLBCL patients. Flow cytometry was then employed to validate the relationship between DLBCL prognosis and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets. Our study integrated genetic drivers through consensus clustering, leading to the identification of 6 distinct \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets in DLBCL and HIs. These subsets include a na\u00efve \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset characterized by TCF7 and LEF1 expression, a memory \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset sharing common genes such as GZMK, IL7R, an anti-tumor \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset with overexpression of IFNG, TNF, and CD69, and two subsets exhibiting TIGIT overexpression indicative of an exhausted \u03b3\u03b4 T cell phenotype. Additionally, a cytotoxic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset marked by increased NKG7 and GZMB levels was identified. Our results revealed that while \u03b3\u03b4 T cells possess anti-tumor capacities, their functional effectiveness is diminished due to differentiation into exhausted subpopulations. Several clusters with high cytotoxicity scores also showed elevated exhaustion scores (C13-\u03b3\u03b4-TIGIT.1, C14-\u03b3\u03b4-TIGIT.2), suggesting the presence of a population in DLBCL samples that is simultaneously exhausted and cytotoxic. In particular, the TIGIT.2 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset manifests a more pronounced exhaustion score relative to TIGIT.1 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset, indicating differential levels of cellular exhaustion among these groups. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between high expression of TIGIT \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets and poorer patient prognoses. We also discovered unique expression profiles within these subgroups: TIGIT.1 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are marked by elevated CXCR4 expression, contrasting with the TIGIT.2 \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subgroup which exhibits increased CX3CR1 expression. Pseudotime analysis implies a potential differentiation trajectory from na\u00efve and GZMK \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to various terminally differentiated subsets, with genes associated with stemness (e.g., TCF-1) subsequently downregulated. These findings suggest that TIGIT.2 subset may be further along in the differentiation trajectory, potentially representing a more terminally differentiated state than TIGIT.1 subset. According to our clinical validation cohort, the TIGIT We identified genetic subtypes of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with distinct genotypic and clinical characteristics in DLBCL patients. Expression levels within these subgroups emerged as potential indicators for patient outcomes and as crucial factors in shaping therapeutic strategies.

A statistically significant increase in perceived quality of life (QOL) was observed from prior- versus post-BTKi discontinuation. Of patients who reported that they experienced clinical CLL progression (n = 80), 46% reported that these events did not happen for \u2265 1 year after BTKi discontinuation. Those that were on a BTKi for \u2265 2 years before discontinuation had more time without CLL relapse. These data provide a unique report of patient experiences. The data suggest that BTKi may be feasible and result in a period of treatment-free remission. The data also indicate that patients are generally relieved when they anticipate BTKi discontinuation and observe significant QOL improvements after BTKi discontinuation.

Fifty female Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, ZNS (100 mg/kg/day), LCM (30 mg/kg/day), CLB (12.5 mg/kg/day), and OXC (100 mg/kg/day). Drugs were administered orally for 90 days. Mating was synchronized with estrous cycles, and implantation sites were assessed histologically using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), E-cadherin, and transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), quantified by H-score analysis. Expression levels of LIF, E-cadherin, and FOXO1 were significantly lower in all treatment groups compared to controls (p < 0.001). Tukey's post hoc analysis revealed significant differences in LIF and E-cadherin among most groups (p < 0.05). No significant differences in FOXO1 expression were observed between ZNS vs. CLB (p = 0.152) or ZNS vs. LCM (p = 0.070), while all other comparisons were significant (p < 0.05). The most pronounced reduction in implantation markers was found in the LCM group. These results suggest that long-term administration of ZNS, OXC, CLB, and LCM may impair implantation by altering key molecular markers.

They post-transcriptionally direct gene expression either by inhibiting translation or initiating degradation of mRNA. Conserved evolutionarily, these miRNAs have a significant role in several developmental and regulatory functions in organisms including mammalian cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. An individual miRNA can modulate a network of mRNA expression by binding to multiple mRNAs through imperfect sequence complementarity. In several types of cancer, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to cell initiation, migration, incursion, proliferation, immortality, and drug resistance. Among all leukemia cases, approximately 15 % of patients suffer from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). miRNA-based modulation offers the idiosyncratic competence for regulating a variety of genes simultaneously; in that way, it could help to modulate accordant signalling pathways that are engaged in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.

GIPA@DP maintained an essentially constant GI/PA ratio in vivo and actively targeted AML cells at different leukemia sites. Selective AML-targeting in conjunction with ratiometric drug codelivery and synergistic anti-AML effects of GIPA@DP collectively led to significant survival benefits in CD38-upregulated MV-4-11 and Molm-13-Luc AML models, outperforming the nontargeted control (GIPA@P) and a mixture of two targeted single drug formulations (GI@DP + PA@DP).

Additionally, CHH modifications showed high methylation across all genomic regions. Within the differential methylation loci (DML), we identified several genes related to tumorigenesis and progression (such as ZDHHC11, NBPF1, and TPTE). Furthermore, we systemically reviewed the literatures on leukemia and DNA methylation modifications, providing a comprehensive description of their correlation. In summary, these findings indicate that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of ALL, offering valuable insights for future research into its impact on leukemia development."}

Due to its rarity, rectal malignant melanoma is often not considered in the initial differential diagnosis. In such clinical scenarios, avoiding misdiagnosis, achieving early detection, and providing appropriate treatment remain major challenges and require particular attention. This case report presents a detailed account of the diagnostic and therapeutic process in a patient with primary rectal malignant melanoma. By sharing this case, we aim to provide clinicians with practical experience and valuable insights, thereby enhancing awareness and understanding of this rare condition within the medical community. A 56-year-old female presented to the hospital with a 10-day history of a perianal mass and hematochezia. Physical examination revealed a soft, flat abdomen with no palpable masses and normal bowel sounds. Imaging findings showed localized thickening of the distal rectum, diffuse mild thickening of the mid-to-upper rectal wall, and multiple small lymph nodes in the sigmoid mesocolon.Postoperative histopathological analysis, supported by immunohistochemical staining, confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic Miles surgery, followed by adjuvant abdominopelvic radiotherapy (GTVtb 50 Gy, CTV45 Gy) and targeted therapy with tislelizumab. She had an uneventful recovery and remained free of disease progression during 48 months of follow-up. This case of rectal malignant melanoma, incidentally diagnosed during hemorrhoidectomy, was successfully treated with laparoscopic Miles' procedure and targeted immunotherapy, resulting in long-term disease-free survival, thereby raising clinical awareness and providing valuable insights for managing similar cases."}

This single-center study involved SC patients from Yamagata University Hospital, enrolled between May 2017 and April 2020. For the healthy controls (HCs), our database comprising salivary metabolomics data of HCs was used. Whole unstimulated saliva samples were collected from patients with SC (n = 75) and HCs (n = 77). Paired tumor and control tissues after SC resection were obtained from the same patients who donated saliva. Hydrophilic metabolites in the tissue and saliva samples were comprehensively analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Using these candidate metabolites, a multiple logistic regression (MLR) model was developed to differentiate SC from HCs RESULTS: Sixty-six and 12 metabolites showed significant differences in tissues and saliva, respectively. Of these, six metabolites were commonly different between SC and HCs. Spermidine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and isoleucine were selected to develop the MLR model. The model exhibited a large area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.802, 95 % confidence interval: 0.731-0.874, P < 0.0001). Additionally, no significant differences were shown in candidate salivary metabolites between stages in both malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The salivary metabolomic profiles between SC and HCs differed clearly. This combination of salivary metabolites could serve as non-invasive biomarkers for screening SC."}

While vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling has been identified as an immune checkpoint and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, its role in melanoma remains unexplored. This study investigated the impact of a novel VIP receptor antagonist, ANT308, on melanoma cell behavior and tumor growth. Using both murine and human UVM/cutaneous melanoma cell lines, we examined the inhibition of VIP receptor signaling and its effects on cell migration and proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, ANT308 downregulated melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) and N-cadherin expression at both the RNA and protein levels, as demonstrated by RNA sequencing and western blot analyses. Knockdown of the VIP receptor VPAC2 in mouse and human melanoma cells produced similar effects on cell migration, proliferation, and MCAM protein expression, further implicating VIP-VPAC2 signaling in tumor progression. In vivo studies revealed that ANT308 treatment decreased MCAM expression in intraocular primary tumors, reduced the number and size of liver metastases following intraocular or subcutaneous melanoma injection, and showed a trend toward reduced tumor volume at the primary tumor site. In conclusion, our findings indicate that VIP receptor signaling promotes liver metastasis in melanoma, and targeting this pathway with VIP receptor antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating metastatic UVM."}

Mitochondria, regulated by various signaling pathways, are an important target in cancer therapy. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probes have gained interest due to their properties such as deep tissue penetration, high image sensitivity, and precision targeting. In this study, we developed a novel NIR fluorescent probe IR-545 for melanoma imaging, which demonstrated mitochondrial targeting and antitumor activity in melanoma cells. In vitro experiments showed that IR-545 was taken up by melanoma cells through organic anion-transport polypeptides and targeted tumor cell mitochondria. IR-545 induced apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of melanoma cells. In vivo, IR-545 significantly inhibited tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and H&E staining confirmed that IR-545 induced tumor cell apoptosis and inhibited proliferation without notable side effects. In conclusion, IR-545 shows significant potential in imaging and treating melanoma, offering a promising new therapeutic approach."}

While the preferred management for early-stage PMMV and PMMC is surgery, comprehensive reports on the impact of various surgical techniques on cancer outcomes are scarce. This study aimed to compare outcomes between open and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in PMMV and PMMC, and concurrently evaluated prognostic risk factors for these conditions. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of PMMV and PMMC patients treated surgically from January 2000 to July 2021. Clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes were assessed retrospectively. Patients underwent either open surgery or MIS. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rates were compared. Of 45 eligible patients, the MIS group showed a higher rate of total vaginectomy (P = 0.022), reduced median intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.031), shorter median hospital stay (P = 0.042), and no significant increase in perioperative complications (P = 0.867). The incidence of negative margins < 1 cm was significantly lower in the MIS group (P = 0.032). Cox proportional hazards regression identified microsatellites (HR = 2.893 [1.042-8.029]; P = 0.042), surgical negative margin distance (HR = 0.042 [0.008-0.217]; P < 0.001), and total vaginectomy (HR = 0.042 [0.008-0.217]; P < 0.001) as independent prognostic factors for DFS. MIS was linked to a significant difference in 2-year DFS (P = 0.030), but there was no notable difference in overall survival (OS) compared to open surgery (P = 0.078). The outcomes are validated through sensitivity analysis and hierarchical assessment, leading to the development of a novel nomogram simultaneously. Total vaginectomy may improve DFS in PMMV and PMMC patients. A combination of MIS and radical vaginal resection can effectively manage PMMV and PMMC as an initial surgical strategy."}

While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks such as skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images and enhanced nondermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results show PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of artificial intelligence support in healthcare."}

A machine learning-based algorithm trained with information on the biological effects and molecular descriptors of analgesics, anesthetics, hypnotics and opioids predicted antitumor effects for dexmedetomidine (DEX). DEX is a sedative acting as an alpha2-adrenoceptor (ADRA2) agonist. Based on these premises, we investigated the putative antineoplastic effects of DEX. In vitro, DEX promoted premortem stresses such as autophagy and partial endoplasmic reticulum stress with the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha and the inhibition of the splicing of X-box binding protein 1. DEX elicited the biomarkers of immunogenic cell death, including the release of ATP and high-mobility group box 1 protein, and the cell surface exposure of calreticulin, enhancing the engulfment of malignant cells by dendritic cells. In immunocompetent mice, DEX decreased the progression of colorectal cancers, fibrosarcomas, mammary carcinomas and melanomas, as it improved overall survival. These effects were inhibited by the ADRA2 antagonist yohimbine, suggesting that DEX mediates its anticancer effects at least in part on-target. Depending on the specific tumor model, DEX also enhanced the cytotoxic T cell/regulatory T cell ratio in the tumor bed and draining lymph nodes. Programmed cell death protein 1 blockade tended to improve DEX effects. After rechallenge with antigenically identical cells, no tumor appeared, indicating the formation of immunological memory. These results confirm the machine learning-predicted anticancer activity of DEX. Beyond its utility as a sedative agent in oncological intensive care, DEX may improve anticancer immunosurveillance and sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint blockade."}

They exert diverse functions in immunity by rapidly releasing a plethora of preformed mediators, including proteoglycans, cytokines, and proteases, which are stored in cytoplasmic granules. Our aim was to systematically and globally identify mast cell-released protein mediators and elucidate their functions. We analysed the secretomes of antigen-activated primary mouse mast cells using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and conducted follow-up studies in vitro, ex vivo and using mast cell-specific genetic mouse models. We identified CSF1 as a novel preformed mast cell mediator present in the granules of all connective tissue-type mast cells. We further show that the mast cell secretome can induce macrophage differentiation and a unique polarisation pattern via CSF1 and other mediators. Mast cell-derived CSF1 has systemic functions, as mast cell-specific CSF1-deficient mice have lower serum CSF1 levels and reduced numbers of circulating monocytes. In addition, using an orthotopic transplantation-based melanoma mouse model, we show that loss of mast cell-derived CSF1 promotes cancer cell expansion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSF1 is also prestored and released by human mast cells. CSF1 is an evolutionarily conserved, constitutive mast cell granule component. Mast cell degranulation induces macrophage differentiation and a unique polarisation state, the former being completely dependent on CSF1, while the latter is only modulated."}
{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "melanoma", "text": "Mild photothermal therapy (mPTT) holds significant potential as a minimally invasive strategy for tumor ablation. However, its clinical translation remains constrained by the uneven intratumoral distribution of photothermal agents and the induction of autophagy pathways. These limitations frequently culminate in suboptimal therapeutic efficacy, facilitating immune evasion by residual tumor cells and thereby elevating the risk of recurrence and metastasis. Here, we report the development of nitric oxide-driven nanomotors (L-Arg-CaP@PDA-CQ) constructed by encapsulating L-arginine within calcium phosphate nanoparticles, functionalized with poly-dopamine shells and loaded with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. These self-propelled nanomotors demonstrated the ability to evade lysosomal phagocytosis, penetrate vascular barriers, and enhance intratumoral accumulation. Autophagy inhibition sensitized melanoma cells to mPTT, while the combination of chloroquine with mPTT induced reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial disruption. Furthermore, mPTT facilitated immunogenic cell death, and chloroquine-mediated inhibition of autophagosome degradation enhanced tumor antigen presentation, stimulating robust T-cell infiltration and immune activation. This dual mechanism significantly suppressed tumor recurrence and metastasis. The proposed nanomotors provide a synergistic paradigm for augmenting mPTT and activating antitumor immunity, highlighting their translational potential in clinical oncology. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mild photothermal therapy (mPTT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that operates at lower temperatures to minimize damage to healthy tissues while promoting antitumor immune responses. However, its efficacy can be limited by the activation of autophagy in tumor cells, which supports tumor survival. In addition, the hypoxic microenvironment of melanoma tumors often restricts drug penetration, further complicating treatment. To address these challenges, we have designed self-propelled smart nanomotors that can actively penetrate acidic tumor tissues and deliver drugs to the tumor site.These nanomotors modulate autophagy to enhance the sensitivity of melanoma cells to mPTT, leading to efficient tumor cell ablation.When combined with chloroquine, this approach generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species and causes mitochondrial damage, while promoting T-cell infiltration through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This strategy not only enhances the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT but also holds significant potential for clinical translation in the treatment of melanoma."}

We cultured these astrocytes and neurons in a 3D hydrogel that contained a domain with metastatic melanoma cells. This approach generated a spatially organized co-culture system with no physical boundary between the tumor and stromal compartments. Then, we leveraged several imaging modalities to study tumor-stroma interactions and changes in the microenvironment. Using non-destructive, luminescence-based methods, we spatially resolved changes in cell viability, metabolite concentration, and other biochemical parameters. We also used luminescence to analyze the effect of radionuclides on tumor cell viability and used PET imaging to monitor their diffusion across the system.&#xD."}

Data on patient demographics, ED visit frequency, length of stay, and medications administered were collected. The primary outcomes were the duration and frequency of ED visits and the types and frequency of analgesics administered. The study included 421 patients accounting for 20 508 ED visits. The average length of stay per ED visit was 4.7 hours. Morphine was the most frequently used opioid, administered to 86% of patients, while paracetamol was the most commonly used analgesic overall (93%). Regional differences were observed, with less opioid use in the Eastern region, where the disease is less severe due to haplotype variations. Ketamine was used in 13% of cases, predominantly in the Western region. The study highlights a diverse approach to AVOC management across Saudi Arabia, with variations influenced by regional differences and physician practices.

We interviewed 7 caregiver-adolescent dyads and 1 caregiver whose child didn't meet inclusion criteria due to age. Thematic analysis revealed 3 major inter-related themes: burden of sickle cell disease, decisional regret about reproductive choices, and hope that infertility would not impact them. Our study found that comprehension about the potential for infertility varied significantly, with a strong underlying hope that infertility will not impact them. Many of our caregivers and adolescents indicated decisional regret, suggesting they would now make a different choice about fertility preservation before transplant. Conversations and communication surrounding infertility in the setting of stem cell transplant is vital for our patients to understand the long-term impacts of curative therapy, to best ensure that their long-term quality of life goals will be met.

While full-thickness penile gangrene is a rare but recognized complication of prolonged ischemic priapism, other cutaneous complications have not been described. We present an unprecedented case of a 40-year-old male who developed vesiculobullous necrosis with distinctive periurethral sparing following trazodone-induced priapism. The patient presented with a 15-hour priapism requiring surgical intervention with a modified proximal shunt, followed by the development of tense bullae on the penile shaft 48 hours after the procedure. We propose that this atypical morphology and distribution reflects distinctive features of the vascular anatomy of the penis, where the glans and periurethral tissues receive redundant blood supply from the terminal branches of the internal pudendal artery, while the shaft skin depends on superficial vessels vulnerable to compression during elevated intracavernosal pressures. The 48-hour delay between intervention and vesiculation is consistent with ischemia-reperfusion injury, a mechanism involving oxidative damage and inflammation triggered by the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues. This case represents a novel cutaneous manifestation of drug-induced priapism that clinicians should distinguish from other vesiculobullous disorders. Recognition of the characteristic distribution may permit clinical diagnosis without the need for biopsy, allowing for appropriate conservative management."}

SCD is a chronic disease that requires knowledge of the disease, self-management, and adherence to treatment plans. While mHealth apps have been made with single features for SCD, there is limited understanding of using an mHealth app with a more comprehensive set of features that could engage adults with SCD, depending on what features they prefer and need to engage and empower them in living with their disease. We evaluated the usage of an mHealth app with various features, including pain tracking, quizzes for patient-facing guidelines, pain and asthma action plans, and goal setting. Adults with SCD were enrolled at 2 sickle cell centers between 2018 and 2022 as part of a 6-month feasibility randomized controlled trial with participants completing surveys at baseline and 6 months. Participants were randomized into receiving either an mHealth app and booklet with patient-facing guidelines or a booklet with the guidelines alone. The mHealth app comprised web pages with patient-facing guideline material and a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) project. The REDCap project included a personal profile, a pain tracker, goal setting, quizzes about the guidelines, and pain or asthma action plans. The REDCap project also included the ability to send daily text messages at a time they chose, which contained a message they could create and a link to their profile. Outcomes included SCD-specific knowledge and acute health care utilization (emergency room visits and hospitalizations). We evaluated the usage of these different features and relationships with baseline variables, each other, and study outcomes. Approximately 75% (50/67) of the enrolled and randomized participants completed all the study components, and 100% (26/26) of the participants who were randomized to the mHealth app arm and completed the study used the mHealth app. Further, 15/30 (50%) participants used multiple features.

Zinc and magnesium are essential micronutrients involved in many cellular processes. Several studies have found that their deficiencies are common in SCD patients and may further complicate the disease. This study was conducted to examine plasma levels of zinc and magnesium in a group of SCD patients in Latakia. Methods A total of 85 SCD patients (52 males and 33 females) with both sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and hemoglobin sickle-beta-thalassemia (Hb S/\u03b2-Thal) genotypes at the steady state, and 30 healthy controls, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with no age limits. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were measured using colorimetric methods. Results Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls (P < 0.05). Twelve SCD patients (14.1%) were zinc-deficient, and 37 (43%) had magnesium deficiency. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were higher in HbSS patients than those with Hb S/\u03b2-Thal patients, but with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Notably, all zinc-deficient SCD patients were < 16 years old. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in zinc deficiency distribution between males and females. Age and gender had no significant statistical relations with magnesium deficiency in SCD patients (P > 0.05). Conclusion This study has shown that plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls, with no significant difference between HbSS and Hb S/\u03b2-Thal genotypes. Zinc and magnesium administration may be required in SCD patients from an early age, especially zinc, to mitigate the adverse effects of their deficiencies."}

Cryptococcal meningitis, caused by C. neoformans, has a high mortality rate and poses a significant threat to global public health. Research indicates that C. neoformans employs various strategies to cross the BBB, with transcellular transport being particularly critical. We observed that C. neoformans infection significantly upregulates the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Silencing EGFR using siRNA technology resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of C. neoformans to traverse the BMEC monolayer. Furthermore, C. neoformans infection also upregulates EGFR ligands, such as HB-EGF, in BMECs, thereby activating the EGFR signaling pathway. This activation involves the engagement of ADAM family metalloproteinases and the metalloprotease Mpr1 from C. neoformans.

However, its efficacy in treating pediatric tuberculous meningitis-related hydrocephalus (TBMH) remains uncertain. The authors' review aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ETV compared to VPS. The authors searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for articles comparing ETV with VPS in the pediatric population. They included studies evaluated success rate, mortality, postprocedural complications, and infections. A random-effects model was used, with heterogeneity assessed with I2 and sensitivity analysis. A pooled analysis of 369 patients from 5 studies (2 randomized controlled trials and 3 observational studies), including 162 patients who underwent ETV and 207 VPS, revealed no significant difference in the success rates between ETV and VPS for TBMH (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45-1.14, p = 0.159, I2 = 0%). Furthermore, no significant differences in the postoperative complication (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08-4.17, p = 0.599, I2 = 75%), mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.23-2.65, p = 0.684, I2 = 0%), or infection (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09-2.87, I2 = 11%) rates were observed. The authors' meta-analysis shows no significant differences in success rates, mortality risk, and incidence of complications and infections between ETV and VPS for children with TBMH. However, the broad confidence intervals and limited number of included studies introduce significant uncertainty. Therefore, while no statistically significant differences have been demonstrated, the equivalence of these treatments cannot be conclusively affirmed, and the potential for clinically significant differences remains."}

The authors followed up 31 patients with traumatic anterior skull base fractures (ASBF) between November 15, 2020 and October 10, 2023. The clinical characteristics, tomography data, and occurrence of CSF fistulas were documented in these patients. Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of admission for most of the 31 patients with anterior skull base fractures (ASBF) (71%, n=26). Rhinorrhea was observed in 9 patients (29.0%). ASBF were most commonly seen in compartment I, representing the frontal sinus region, in 24 patients (77.4%), followed by compartment III, representing the sphenoid sinus region, in 22 patients (71.0%), and compartment II, representing the fovea ethmoidalis and cribriform plate region, in 21 patients (67.7%). Although conditions such as skull base fracture displacement and the presence of pneumocephalus were numerically higher in the patient group with rhinorrhea, they were not statistically significant. In addition, the contribution of acetazolamide use and high body mass index values \u200b\u200bto the development of rhinorrhea in traumatic anterior skull base fractures was not statistically significant. Traumatic ASBF are complicated due to conditions such as CSF fistula, intracranial hemorrhage, and meningitis, and should be managed with a multidisciplinary approach. Traumatic anterior skull base fractures occur more frequently in compartment 1. Numerous factors may influence the formation and duration of posttraumatic CSF fistula, and these factors should be assessed in larger patient series."}

Here, we present a five-country, within-trial analysis exploring the household economic impact of cryptococcal meningitis. Eight hundred and ten participants were recruited into this sub-study in Botswana, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe between January 2018 and February 2021. We collected data on annual household expenditure, direct costs and indirect costs incurred prior to enrolment and during the 10-week trial period. Costs were inflated and converted to 2022 USD. We calculated out-of-pocket expenditure, lost income and catastrophic healthcare expenditure, defined as costs exceeding 20% of annual household expenditure. The average total out-of-pocket expenditure plus lost income prior to enrolment was $132 and 17.9% (145/810, 95% CI 15.3-20.5) of participant households had already experienced catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Among the 592 surviving participants, when combining out-of-pocket expenditure and lost income, the average cost was $516 and 29.1% of annual household expenditure across all countries, ranging from $230 (7.6%) in South Africa to $592 (64.2%) in Zimbabwe. More than half (296/581, 51.0%, 95% CI 46.9-55.0) of households experienced catastrophic healthcare expenditure by the end of the trial, ranging from 16.0% (13/81, 95% CI 7.9-24.2) in South Africa to 68.1% (156/229, 95% CI 62.0-74.2) in Uganda.

While some cases are asymptomatic, others present with diverse clinical manifestations, including cerebellar dysfunction, brainstem compression, headaches, hydrocephalus, myelopathy, oropharyngeal dysfunction, sleep-related breathing disorders, scoliosis, and syringomyelia. Surgical intervention is the only treatment option for symptomatic patients, involving foramen magnum decompression (FMD) to decompress the craniovertebral junction and normalize cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Cervical laminectomy and duraplasty may be added depending on the severity of cerebellar tonsil herniation and brainstem compression. Complications of duraplasty include pseudomeningocele formation, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, acute postoperative hydrocephalus, and meningitis. We report a devastating case of a pediatric patient with Chiari malformation who developed cerebellar hemorrhage from a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) after FMD, resulting in death. A 16-year-old female was diagnosed with scoliosis, Chiari malformation, and syringomyelia at age 4. At age 15, due to the progression of scoliosis, corrective fusion surgery was planned, but surgical treatment for Chiari malformation was performed first. The surgery involved FMD, during which a well-developed occipital sinus was observed. When performing duraplasty in addition to FMD and upper cervical laminectomy, the occipital sinus was ligated to reduce bleeding risk. The postoperative course was uneventful with no obvious neurological deficits, and the patient was discharged home. The corrective fusion surgery for scoliosis was also successfully completed, and outpatient follow-up continued. One year and five months after the FMD surgery, the patient presented with a sudden headache and vomiting. Brain MRI revealed cerebellar hemorrhage and suspected dAVF to the occipital sinus. Cerebral angiography showed the occipital artery as the main feeder, the paramedian posterior marginal sinus as the shunt point, and the occipital sinus as the main drainer. Due to deep venous reflux indicating high risk of rebleeding, transarterial and transvenous embolization were performed. However, cerebral edema progressed, hydrocephalus worsened, and cerebellar hemorrhage recurred, resulting in the patient's death. When performing FMD in pediatric cases, thorough preoperative evaluation of venous sinuses is essential. Care should be taken to avoid ligation when a well-developed occipital sinus is observed. In such cases, consider limiting the procedure to bony decompression only."}

This study aimed to identify exosomal miRNAs that could serve as novel biomarkers of type 1 AIP. We extracted miRNAs from the exosomes of patients with AIP, chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic cancer, and healthy control individuals. To identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) associated with AIP, second-generation sequencing and differential expression analysis were performed. Target gene prediction, immune correlation analysis, functional annotation, and construction of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and transcription factor (TF)-miRNA-mRNA networks were then performed. Finally, qPCR analysis and ROC evaluation were performed for hub DEmiRNA. Exosomal miRNAs exhibited specific expression profiles in patients with type 1 AIP. The differentially expressed target genes PLXNA2 and PGM3, and the differentially expressed lncRNA MALAT1 associated with hsa-miR-30b-5p were identified. KEGG analysis showed that PLXNA2 was enriched in the axon guidance. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that PLXNA2 and PGM3 were significantly negatively correlated with activated CD4 T cells, type 1 T helper cells and other immune cells. The TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network showed that FOXA1 was a TF for PLXNA2 and PGM3, and RUNX2 was a TF for PLXNA2. Moreover, FOXA1 and RUNX2 were also the target genes of hsa-miR-30b-5p.

This study included 114 patients with AIP treated at Tohoku University Hospital. The SM index was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis device, grip strength was measured using a hand dynamometer, and bone mineral density was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze factors associated with SM loss and sarcopenia. Among 114 patients, 57 (50.0%) had SM loss, 31 (27.2%) had reduced grip strength, and 27 (23.7%) had both. Patients with SM loss were older and had a lower body mass index, weaker grip strength, higher Controlling Nutritional Status scores, and lower serum lipase and albumin levels compared to those without SM loss. Computed tomography scans revealed a higher prevalence of pancreatic parenchymal atrophy in patients with SM loss. Similar differences were observed between patients with sarcopenia and those without.

Our small RNA sequencing analysis identified microRNA (miR)-100-5p as a potential target. Adult male Balb/c mice were then randomly assigned to the IMQ, IMQ plus MSC-exosomes (IMQ + Exo), IMQ plus MSC-exosomes treated with a specific miR-100-5p inhibitor (IMQ + Exoi), or IMQ plus agomiR-100-5p group (IMQ + AgomiR) (n = 6 per group). Control groups were also included. Mice were sacrificed, and psoriasis severity was assessed the day after 6 consecutive days of daily IMQ exposure, followed by 7 consecutive days of daily treatment.

This resulted in clinical and morphological complete and sustained remission of CRMO within 12 weeks and a significant improvement of the psoriasis after six months of treatment with no occurrence of severe adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first case report demonstrating complete and safe remission of CRMO associated with palmoplantar psoriasis treated with the TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib."}

Although previous studies and meta-analyses found an association between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease later in life, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal. Furthermore, research conducted to date has not consistently excluded women with chronic hypertension and/or kidney disease prior to pregnancy, indicating a possible selection bias. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of the updated literature on renal outcomes in women who were healthy prior to pregnancy and experienced pre-eclampsia. We searched PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase for eligible studies. We included retrospective and prospective studies involving healthy women with pre-eclampsia and reporting kidney outcomes. Of the 2,796 titles originally screened, 9 studies met our inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analytic model was used for statistical analysis. A statistically significant increase in the risk of developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease later in life following pre-eclampsia was found (meta-analytic risk ratios [95% confidence interval]: 1.83 [1.16-2.89] and 8.96 [4.94-16.23], respectively), with high statistical heterogeneity. However, the only prospective study did not find a significant association between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease. Although a significant association was identified, its clinical relevance and causality remain unclear. Postpartum medical investigation in women affected by pre-eclampsia is essential, but long-term follow-up may not be indicated in the absence of underlying conditions. Only prospective studies could clarify the relationship between pre-eclampsia and kidney disease in women who were healthy before pregnancy."}

TGF\u03b2 is a powerful cytokine capable of dominating the fibrotic process. Targeting factors capable of activating latent TGF-\u03b2 is a more effective and safe strategy to reduce TGF-\u03b2-induced fibrosis, but appropriate targets need to be identified. Here, we show that ADAMTS18/Adamts18 is significantly upregulated in the fibrotic kidneys of human CKD patients and mice. ADAMTS18 is primarily produced by renal tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts during RF. Functionally, Adamts18 deletion inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, and collagen synthesis. Conversely, Adamts18 overexpression exacerbates progressive renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, the KPFR sequence in ADAMTS18 disrupts the latency-associated peptide (LAP) interaction with TGF-\u03b2 and increases the release of mature TGF-\u03b21. Blockage of ADAMTS18-mediated latent TGF-\u03b2 activation by a tetrapeptide (LSKL) effectively reverses RF.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 38 (USP38) has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in CKD-related ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is yet to be clarified. This research systematically explores the involvement of USP38 in the development of VAs in CKD. This study employed cardiac-specific Usp38 knockout and transgenic Usp38 mice, along with H9c2 cells transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying Usp38 (AdUsp38) or shRNA targeting Usp38 (AdshUsp38). The mouse model was generated via 5/6 nephrectomy, and CKD cell models were created using indoxyl sulfate (IS) induction. These models underwent extensive evaluation, including echocardiography, electrophysiology, histological studies, and molecular analysis. In CKD mouse models, USP38 expression was markedly elevated and predominantly localized in ventricular myocytes. Knocking out Usp38 markedly decreased the susceptibility and duration of rapid VAs in CKD mice and corrected the abnormal expression of ion channel proteins. Comparable findings were observed in Usp38 transgenic mouse models. From a mechanistic perspective, Usp38 knockout reduced oxidative stress in cardiac tissues and upregulated antioxidative enzyme expression. The enhancement was mainly achieved by increasing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) ubiquitination and degradation, along with inhibition of downstream CaMKII activity. In contrast, USP38 overexpression had harmful effects on the heart, which were alleviated by NOX4 inhibition. This study demonstrated that USP38 stabilizes NOX4 expression via deubiquitination, resulting in increased oxidative stress and hyperphosphorylation of CaMKII, which markedly enhances the susceptibility of CKD mice to VAs. These findings underscore the critical regulatory role of USP38 in CKD-related arrhythmias, providing a promising therapeutic target for USP38-directed treatments."}

Many small-sample, single-institution studies have looked at how patient factors can affect the risk of failure of these first-line treatments. Few have looked at a large, multi-institutional cohort to determine the significant risk factors. Patients who have chronic knee PJIs were identified in a de-identified records database. Failure after first-line treatment was defined as the need for further surgery, such as irrigation and debridement, re-revision, amputation, or arthrodesis, or the need for suppressive antibiotics. The five-year risk of failure was evaluated for individual patient factors in order to identify variables for a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Overall risk for the individual measures of failure, as well as 90-day mortality, was also reported. Over five years after first-line treatment, 27.8% of 2-stage revisions failed and 40.4% of 1-stage revisions failed. Treatment failure was seen more commonly in patients who had prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, a body mass index greater than or equal to 30, or a previous diagnosis of depression. Those patients who underwent 2-stage revision surgeries first were more likely to fail with previous diagnoses of chronic kidney disease, lymphedema, or resistance to other antimicrobials.

We analyzed retrospective data from 124 CKD stage 5 patients who underwent kidney transplantation. Pulse wave signals were collected using SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia), and CAC scores were determined via CT scans. Machine learning models were developed using either pulse wave features or traditional risk factors (TRF) to detect high CAC scores (\u2265100 Agatston units). The pulse wave-based model outperformed TRF-based model in identifying high CAC scores, particularly among younger patients. Specifically, the pulse wave-based classifier showed superior balanced accuracy in all analyzed age groups and superior sensitivity in patients under 60 years old, especially in those under 50 years old. The overall balanced accuracy of the pulse wave-based model exceeded 80 %, suggesting its potential as a reliable screening tool for detecting high risk of coronary atherosclerosis in CKD patients.

For the verification of tooth recognition, the data from the validation set were randomly selected for analysis. Three groups of Mask R-CNN networks were compared: A scratch-trained baseline using randomly initialized weights (R group); A transfer learning approach with models pre-trained on COCO for object detection (C group); A variant pre-trained on ImageNetfor for object detection (I group). All configurations maintained identical hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. The deep learning model used ResNet-50 as the backbone network and was trained to 300epoch respectively. We assessed training loss, detection and training times, diagnostic accuracy, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and coverage precision to compare performance across the groups. Transfer learning significantly reduced training times compared to non-transfer learning approach (p < 0.05). The average detection time for group R was 0.269 \u00b1 0.176 s, whereas groups I (0.323 \u00b1 0.196 s) and C (0.346 \u00b1 0.195 s) exhibited significantly longer detection times (p < 0.05).

A nested case-control study was conducted in a prospective cohort study to follow up preschoolers from 36 months to 48 months of age. Dental caries status and supragingival plaque data were collected at each follow-up visit, and questionnaire surveys of their mothers were conducted to collect information on the socio-demographic backgrounds and oral health-related behaviors of the preschoolers. High-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing technology was used to observe the oral microbial diversity in children, and an ECC risk prediction model was constructed using the random forest method. There were 18 preschoolers each in the caries-free to caries-free group (H2H), caries-free to decayed group (H2C) and decayed to decayed group (C2C) according to ECC progression. The alpha diversity analysis showed statistically significant differences in the Simpson and Shannon indices between the H2H and H2C groups (P < 0.05), and the beta diversity analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the H2H group and the H2C and C2C groups.

This study aimed to examine the association between these interventions and caries experience in preschool children, and to assess related socioeconomic inequalities. We analysed aggregated municipality-level data (n = 346) on dental caries outcomes in five-year-olds, coverage of fluoride varnish applications, delivery of toothbrushing materials (toothbrushes and 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste), exposure to community water fluoridation (CWF), rurality, and socioeconomic deprivation. The primary outcome was the caries experience of children covered by the programme since its national rollout in 2015. Univariate and multivariate weighted linear regression models assessed associations between programme interventions and caries experience, adjusting for deprivation and CWF. Socioeconomic inequalities in caries experience were evaluated using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). The distribution of programme delivery across socioeconomic deciles was assessed using weighted regression models. Data on 309,360 five-year-olds were included. Complete delivery of toothbrushing materials was associated with lower caries experience (50.1% vs. 55.0%), a 4.9% difference (95% CI: 2.5%, 7.2%) after adjustment. CWF exposure was associated with a 7.5% lower caries experience (95% CI: 4.2%, 10.9%). The combination of both interventions showed the lowest caries levels, with a 13.4% difference compared to areas with neither intervention (95% CI: 7.5%, 19.3%). Fluoride varnish application was not significantly associated with caries experience. Delivery of interventions was equitable across socioeconomic groups.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "dental caries", "text": "We know that ECC (Early Childhood Caries) has a multifactorial aetiology, in which dietary factors play a particularly significant role. Early childhood is a critical period during which exposure to various foods and flavours significantly shapes dietary preferences and future eating behaviours. Early dietary patterns can also influence bacterial ecology, including the colonisation of Streptococcus mutans, whose presence is a strong predictor of future caries incidence in young children. Early exposure to sugary foods and beverages can, therefore, have important consequences, laying the groundwork for future cariogenic dietary patterns or shaping acidogenic bacterial populations in the oral cavity. The American Heart Association recommends avoiding added sugars in food and beverages for children under two years of age. Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against introducing fruit juices before 12 months of age and recommends limiting their consumption to no more than four times per week for children aged one to three years. ECC also shares common risk factors with other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Therefore, strategies for the prevention of dental caries should aim not only at ensuring proper oral hygiene but also at promoting appropriate dietary habits from early childhood- namely, limited intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and refined foods. In this context, parents can and must play a crucial role by providing their children with healthier dietary choices and behaviours. We must thus consider early childhood caries as a condition whose origins-and solutions-lie within the family environment: children learn habits from those who care for them and control what, when, and how they eat. Changing a family's dietary habits is undoubtedly challenging, but we must recognise that interventions in ECC cases-especially early forms-necessarily require a family-centred approach. It is therefore essential to work in close collaboration with experienced nutritionists to collect data on dietary habits, identify unhealthy patterns, and design balanced, healthy diets for the entire family- supporting a virtuous path toward overall, not just oral, health."}

Children with disabilities, in particular, are at a higher risk of developing dental caries due to a lack of ability to carry out routine oral healthcare procedures and limited access to dental care. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of various caries preventive strategies among children with disabilities. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched from the commencement of the search to 22nd January 2024. Randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different caries preventive strategies in children with disabilities were included in the study. The risk of bias in the studies was determined by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I). A total of 130 articles were obtained after applying the search strategy with the assigned keywords. Two reviewers extracted the outcome data and independently evaluated the quality of the study. Studies applying the various caries preventive strategies in disabled children were included, and a qualitative analysis was conducted on nine articles with full text. The study found that preventive strategies, such as fluoride treatments, pit and fissure sealants, and regular dental check-ups, were effective in reducing the incidence of dental caries among children with disabilities. The study also highlighted the need for improved access to dental care for this population. By providing accessible facilities, effective communication mediums, and individualized preventive strategies, we can ensure that these children receive the best oral health care available.

{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "dental caries", "text": "Dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease resulting from the interplay of microbial, dietary, and host-related factors. In young children, the occurrence of severe caries (SC) is characterized by the presence of one or more decayed lesions in the primary teeth before the age of six. A particularly aggressive variant, known as early childhood caries (ECC), emerges during infancy and early childhood. ECC is recognized as a significant global health concern, impacting both industrialized and developing nations alike. It often presents at an early stage, advances swiftly-particularly in high-risk populations-and frequently remains untreated.Beyond its immediate dental implications, ECC adversely affects a child's overall health and well-being, with potential repercussions for their family. The condition is associated not only with pain, infection, and compromised oral function but also with broader systemic outcomes, including nutritional deficiencies and growth disturbances. Children with ECC are frequently reported to have lower body weight, impaired growth patterns, and a higher prevalence of anemia and malnutrition.Among the nutritional deficiencies linked to ECC, iron deficiency anemia-and specifically diminished serum ferritin levels-has drawn particular attention. Ferritin, as an indicator of iron stores in the body, plays a crucial role in growth and development, and its depletion can influence both systemic and oral health. Despite the widespread prevalence of both dental caries and iron deficiency across the globe, limited research has been conducted to determine whether a correlation exists between the two.Given this context, the present study aims to examine the potential association between serum ferritin levels and the presence of ECC in pediatric patients. Establishing such a relationship could provide valuable insights into the shared risk factors and possible integrated strategies for prevention and management. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO, Embase, Google Scholar, and other relevant platforms. The search strategy was designed to identify studies focusing on the relationship between ECC and iron status, particularly serum ferritin levels. Keywords and search terms included combinations such as \"early childhood caries,\" \"ECC and ferritin,\" and \"ECC and iron deficiency.\" Studies were included if they examined the association between ECC and serum ferritin or other indicators of iron deficiency. Both observational and interventional studies involving pediatric populations were considered, with no restrictions placed on geographical location or study design. Findings from the reviewed literature suggest a potential inverse relationship between ECC and serum ferritin levels, indicating that children with ECC may be at greater risk for iron deficiency. However, further investigations involving larger, well-defined sample populations are needed to draw more definitive conclusions and to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this association. Management of dental conditions, especially in young children, should extend beyond the oral cavity to consider the patient's overall health. The early pediatric age-group is particularly vulnerable, and dental professionals must recognize the importance of systemic factors-such as nutritional status and iron levels-in relation to oral disease. An integrated approach that includes routine screening for iron deficiency in children with ECC could contribute to more comprehensive care and better long-term health outcomes.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 94 LDS patients (47 males and 47 females) at Mayo Clinic locations in Arizona, Rochester, and Florida. Data were collected from chart reviews, including comorbidities, physical exam findings, vascular events, and surgeries. Statistical analysis included Chi-square tests to compare the two groups. Among the cohort, females had higher rates of obesity (23.4 % vs. 8.5 %, p = 0.049) and migraines (44.7 % vs. 21.3 %, p = 0.027). Females also had more easy bruising (31.9 % vs. 8.5 %, p = 0.005), while dolichocephaly was more common in males (21.3 % vs. 6.4 %, p = 0.036). Males had more aneurysms and dissections, including ascending aortic (89.4 % vs. 72.3 %, p = 0.036) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (34 % vs. 10.6 %, p = 0.006), and aneurysms in other locations (63 % vs. 42.6 %, p = 0.048).

Migraine is characterised by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and pain hypersensitivity. This study evaluated effects of RA in a nitroglycerine (NG) induced model of migraine like headache with sumatriptan as a standard drug. Mice were divided into five groups namely: control, NG-treated, NG + RA (20 mg/kg), NG + RA (40 mg/kg), and NG + sumatriptan. It was observed that NG administration led to reduced pain thresholds, increased head-scratching, photosensitivity, elevated nitrite levels, oxidative stress, and upregulated neuroinflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, CGRP). RA, particularly at 40 mg/kg, significantly reversed these effects by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing inflammation, and improving neuronal integrity. Histopathological analysis revealed reduced satellitosis and preserved cortical and trigeminal nucleus caudalis structures. These findings highlight RA's neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for migraine."}
{"entity_type": "disease", "query": "migraine", "text": "Triptans are efficacious, largely prescribed antimigraine drugs but where and how they exert their therapeutic effect is debated. Because of the presumed impermeability of the blood brain barrier to triptans, a peripheral antimigraine effect of these drugs have been repeatedly proposed. Recent findings, however, indicate that triptans cross the blood brain barrier, and counteract central nociception in models of pronociceptive sensitization. Here, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan in models of opioid withdrawal and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, two conditions sustained by deranged descending facilitation by the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). We found that s.c. sumatriptan injection in morphine-dependent rats 30 min before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal reduced severity of withdrawal symptoms. We also found that at the time of naloxone injection sumatriptan reached contents of 294\u00b119 and 371\u00b130 pg/mg of tissue in the RVM and locus coeruleus, respectively. In keeping with data on morphine withdrawal, s.c. sumatriptan injections suppressed thermal hyperalgesia in rats undergoing repeated dosing of morphine. Sumatriptan affected neither behavioral signs in morphine-dependent rats unexposed to naloxone, nor the extent of the initial antinociceptive response to morphine. Overall, data suggest that peripherally injected sumatriptan reaches CNS concentrations sufficient to exert functional neuromodulation of brainstem regions involved in pronociceptive sensitization and nociplasticity. PERSPECTIVE: This article reports that sumatriptan reduces symptoms of morphine withdrawal and morphine-induced hyperalgesia. Data suggests that triptans exert their antinociceptive effects through central mechanisms."}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry plays a crucial role in identifying these alterations, yet the clinical significance remains debated. While gray matter volume and cortical curvature are commonly analyzed, cortical thickness offers a more direct measure of cytoarchitectural differences and neuroplastic changes in migraine. Advanced structural MRI techniques, including surface-based morphometry and voxel-based morphometry, have provided insights into cortical thickness alterations in migraine. These methods enable high-resolution assessment of brain morphometry, revealing dynamic changes associated with migraine phases and treatment.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes findings from cortical thickness studies, focusing on methodological approaches, variations in imaging sequences and study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.ResultsStudies using surface-based morphometry (i.e. SBM) and voxel-based morphometry (i.e. VBM) have reported inconsistent findings. Increased thickness is frequently observed in pain-processing regions, such as the somatosensory cortex, insula and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting hyperexcitability or maladaptive neuroplasticity. by contrast, cortical thinning has been noted in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and visual cortex, suggesting neuronal loss or impaired cortical integrity. Differences between episodic and chronic migraine further highlight progressive structural changes associated with disease burden. Emerging evidence also suggests that preventive treatments, including calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies and botulinum toxin A, may reverse some of these cortical alterations, particularly in treatment responders.ConclusionsCortical thickness analysis provides valuable insights into migraine pathophysiology, offering a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response. However, inconsistencies across studies highlight the need for standardized MRI protocols and larger longitudinal investigations to clarify the clinical relevance of cortical thickness changes in migraine."}

This study aims to explore the potential relationship between the TC/HDL-C ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with migraine and determine optimal thresholds for prognostic prediction. Data from the 1999\u20132004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, encompassing 654 patients with migraine, were analyzed. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) was employed to delineate the dose-response relationship between the TC/HDL-C ratio and mortality risk. TC/HDL-C ratio was categorized into two groups based on thresholds derived from RCS and the maximally selected rank statistics method (MSRSM). Weighted multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess associations, adjusting for demographic variables, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were conducted to evaluate survival prognosis and prediction accuracy. Over a median follow-up of 16.33 years, 126 (19.27%) of the 654 patients died. RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between TC/HDL-C ratio and all-cause mortality. In the multivariable model, higher TC/HDL-C ratio (MSRSM-derived threshold of 5.15) were associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio = 2.986, 95% confidence interval = 1.495\u20135.967, This study reveals a nonlinear, U-shaped relationship between the TC/HDL-C ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with migraine, with higher TC/HDL-C ratio emerging as a robust, independent predictor of mortality.

Blood-based biomarkers for inflammation and neuronal and glial injury have been evaluated as potential markers of disease severity and prognosis in AE. Patients diagnosed with LGI1 AE, confirmed by cell-based assay, were enrolled and followed prospectively to gather plasma samples for biomarker testing. Biomarkers of neuronal and glial injury included plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL-1), tau, and cytokine markers of inflammation. Biomarker data were logarithmically transformed and analyzed using longitudinal regression with the ratio of means between LGI1 AE and non-inflammatory controls. Clinical data were collected and correlated with blood-based biomarkers to assess their relationship to disease severity and long-term outcomes. Twenty-one LGI1 AE patients were enrolled from October 2018 to April 2024, and 16 migraine headache patients (56.3% male; average age: 58 years) served as non-inflammatory controls. One LGI1 AE patient in our cohort had a clinical relapse. Modified Rankin Score (mRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved over time. The mRS at symptom onset was 3.34 and dropped to 0.56 in a 5-year follow-up. Mean MoCA scores were 18.45 at the onset and increased to 29.40 in the 6-year follow-up. The model estimated geometric mean plasma NfL values at disease diagnosis to be 11.86 pg/mL; it was estimated to be 6.07 pg/mL when compared to non-inflammatory controls. The model also estimated the plasma GFAP values to be 77.70 pg/mL; it was estimated to be 36.26 pg/mL when compared to non-inflammatory controls. The trend of clinical improvement is paralleled with a slow decline in NfL and GFAP levels, returning to levels like our control population after 6 and 3 years, respectively. MoCA scores tended to recover more quickly in patients presenting with lower Nfl scores at symptom onset. Improved clinical symptoms were correlated with improvements in initially high NfL and GFAP levels. In one patient with a clinical relapse, NfL and GFAP levels increased. NfL and GFAP may be useful biomarkers of disease progression in patients with LGI1 AE. However, additional studies are needed to better understand the effects of immunotherapy."}

As clinical adoption increases, postmarket surveillance becomes essential to ensure safety beyond controlled trial environments. This study aimed to characterize postmarket adverse events and product problems associated with FDA-cleared PDTs using data from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. This approach supports the generation of hypothesis-forming safety signals in naturalistic care settings, where adherence patterns, off-label use, and user variability are more likely to emerge. Methods We conducted a retrospective, pharmacovigilance study of the MAUDE database through April 30, 2025. Device-specific product codes were used to identify reports related to 13 FDA-cleared PDTs as follows: reSET (Middletown, CT: PursueCare) for substance use disorder, reSET-O (Middletown, CT: PursueCare) for opioid use disorder, Somryst (Alpharetta, GA: Nox Health) and SleepioRx (San Francisco, CA: Big Health) for chronic insomnia, EndeavorRx (Boston, MA: Akili, Inc.) for pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parallel (San Francisco, CA: Mahana Therapeutics Inc.) and Regulora (Chicago, IL: metaMe Health) for irritable bowel syndrome, Stanza (San Francisco, CA: Swing Therapeutics, Inc.) for fibromyalgia, AspyreRx (New York City, NY: Click Therapeutics, Inc.) for type-2 diabetes, Rejoyn (Princeton, NJ: Otsuka Precision Health, Inc.) for major depressive disorder, DaylightRx (San Francisco, CA: Big Health) for generalized anxiety disorder, MamaLift Plus (Princeton, NJ: Curio Digital Therapeutics) for postpartum depression, and CT-132 (New York City, NY: Click Therapeutics, Inc.) for episodic migraine. Each report was manually reviewed for relevance and data extracted on event type, patient demographics, outcomes, and product details. Results Four reports were initially identified. Two were excluded after verification that they involved non-cleared or over-the-counter digital products. Of the remaining two, one report involved Somryst for insomnia prescribed to a patient with a seizure disorder, a known contraindication listed in its labeling, and resulted in disability. The other involved EndeavorRx, which reported perceived ineffectiveness without clinical harm. No adverse events were identified for the remaining 11 PDTs. Conclusions In this study, only two adverse event reports associated with FDA-cleared PDTs were identified in the MAUDE database. While this may suggest a favorable safety profile, the findings must be interpreted with caution given the limitations of passive surveillance systems, including underreporting, reporting bias, and limited capacity to capture software-specific harms. These preliminary results highlight the need for modernized, active safety monitoring frameworks tailored to the unique risks of digital therapeutics."}

Ten key factors were identified in the analysis: four factors consistently acted as barriers (fatigue, sensory overload, symptoms, social expectations), four as facilitators (physical activity, assistive items, social support, health professional support), and two demonstrated a more complex, bidirectional influence (mental health, environment). These ten factors were organized to four overarching thematic groups: intrinsic factors, environmental and adaptive factors, social influences and symptom management. Adults with symptoms lasting greater than 10 days post-mild TBI report that a combination of symptoms, including fatigue and sensory overload prevent their ability to return to physical activity. The environment, social support structures, and access to health professional support facilitated individuals with returning to their physical activities.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) matched and analyzed the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to describe work-related MVCs. BLS matched CFOI and FARS data for 2011-2014. The matching algorithm used a series of iterative matches allowing for increasing levels of flexibility. Descriptive epidemiologic analysis was conducted to examine potential risk factors for MVCs. Crashes: Information on 3,822 fatal work-related MVCs was successfully matched. A collision (n = 3,156, 82.5%) was most often the first injury- or damage-producing event. Collisions with motor vehicles in transport accounted for 1,769 (46.5%) of crashes. Vehicles: The match identified 3,879 vehicles. Over half (53.6%) were large trucks. In most vehicles, one fatality (n = 3,657) occurred. Multiple worker fatalities per vehicle (n = 203) were more common in heavy trucks (n = 59, 29.1%) and pick-up trucks (n = 36, 17.7%). The match identified 4,060 workers, 3,581 (88.2%) of whom were drivers. Workers employed in transportation, warehousing, and utilities (38.2%) and services (24.4%) accounted for most fatalities. Among passengers, the highest proportions were observed in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (28.6%) and construction (20.0%).

We investigated changes in motor output of mechanically induced cough during a repeated stimulation protocol, as may occur during aspiration of food / liquid over a meal. The occurrence, magnitude, phase durations, and power spectra characteristics of diaphragm and abdominal muscle electromyograms, and esophageal pressures during coughing were recorded during repeated mechanical stimulation of the trachea in cats. After the initial increase in cough excitability, repeated tracheal stimulation resulted in reduced cough number, electromyograms and esophageal pressure magnitudes, which fit an exponential model. There was little change in cough phase durations. Additionally, a pause in sequential airway stimulation (lasting several minutes) resulted in a further cough reduction, associated with prolongation of cough phase durations, but was resolved after one additional stimulus trial, consistent with long-latency transient depression. Power spectral analysis suggested changes in recruitment of motor units for parasternal muscles and no signs of fatigue although hundreds of coughs were executed. Our results are consistent with the presence of central adaptive mechanisms that can regulate the excitability of repetitive coughing, likely overlapping with transient potentiation and depression.

In a randomized crossover design, fourteen active women performed four different inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW) protocols followed by maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and repeated inspiratory resistance breathing (RIRB) tests. Heart rate variability was also monitored before and after IMW. IMW techniques included deep inspiration with normal expiration (DI), deep inspiration with short breath-holding (DI-H), deep inspiration with short breath-holding followed by shallow breathing alternate (DI-H/SB), and deep inspiration and expiration (DI-DE). Each protocol was performed six breathing cycles per set for five sets, one-minute rest between sets. MVV and RIRB score were significantly increased by both protocols with breath-holding (MVV: p = 0.002, p =0.021; RIRB p = 0.002, p= 0.002, in DI-H and DI-H/SB, respectively). Deep inspiration alone did not affect both parameters. On the other hand, slow deep inspiration and deep expiration increased RIRB attempts (p = 0.020) without any effect on MVV value. Electrocardiogram indicated a significant decrease in RMSSD heart rate variability in deep inspiration with short breath-holding continuously (p = 0.043) and slow deep inspiration and deep expiration techniques (p = 0.032). However, a decrease was not observed in the technique of deep/shallow breathing alternate. The data suggested that the addition of short breath-holding during IMW exerted significant stress on inspiratory muscles, which consequently activated a higher tolerance to fatigue. Deep/shallow alternate breathing helped lessen the stress due to breath-holding."}

High-intensity resistance training (HIRT) seems to be effective in reducing fatigue among PwMS. To qualitatively describe experiences and perceived outcomes of PwMS who participated in a randomized controlled trial of HIRT, and their perceptions on maintenance of training in their everyday life. Of 68 eligible participants, 17 PwMS (4 men, 13 women) were recruited through purposive sampling. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted via Zoom or Teams. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis. The theme \"Feeling hopeful and empowered by exercise in a socially supportive setting\" illustrated participants' overall experience. The theme was supported by the three categories: \"Exercise in a safe and encouraging context\", \"Feeling confident in living with MS-fatigue\", and \"Challenging to maintain exercise habits\", and seven subcategories. Participating in the HIRT trial was overall described as a positive and motivating experience. It provided a safe and encouraging environment. Most participants described reduced fatigue and an increase in their engagement in everyday life. Despite the overall positive perception of HIRT, participants encountered difficulties in sustaining their exercise routines over time. Peer support from both individuals with MS and physiotherapists with MS competence were important factors to enhance engagement in the HIRT programme. The group setting provided a supportive and encouraging environment. In addition, the training seemed to be a tool to alleviate fatigue and facilitate partaking in everyday activities for most participants. However, ongoing support to maintain exercise habits in the long term may be needed."}

Spinal fluid drainage (SFD) is used to reduce SCI risk in open surgery; however, many question the safety of SFD in endovascular repair. The objective of this retrospective study was to review the risks of prophylactic spinal fluid drainage in 1445 patients undergoing open and endovascular TAA and TAAA repair from 1987 to 2023. Spinal drains were placed in open TAAA repairs and endovascular repairs planning >12cm aortic coverage. Cardiac anesthesiologists placed and managed all drains. From 2000-2023 spinal drains for elective surgery were placed using fluoroscopic guidance. Spinal fluid was drained to <5-8 mmHg depending on SCI risk. If bloody fluid appeared, drainage was stopped and head CT obtained. Drainage was stopped when patient demonstrated normal leg strength; drains were removed at 48 hours if leg strength was normal. Post-SFD headache was treated with blood patch. We tracked intraoperative fluid drained, neurologic complications from SFD (any neurologic deficit from intracranial or spinal hematoma), bloody spinal fluid, intracranial blood on head CT without neurologic deficit, headache requiring blood patch, transient SCI (paraparesis/paraplegia), and permanent SCI (paraparesis/paraplegia). Of the 1445 patients (1029 open, 416 endovascular) undergoing TAA/TAAA repair, 1007 (777 open, 230 endovascular) had SFD. Before 2000, 263 open repairs done with smaller drains had an average of 125mls of fluid drained intraoperatively to achieve pressure goals. From 2000-2023 intraoperative SFD to achieve pressure goals averaged 132mls in open and 81mls in endovascular repairs. Six patients (0.6%) had neurologic complications from SFD; 5 of these (0.77%) occurred in open patients. Only 1 patient having endovascular repair had a neurologic complication from SFD (0.43%). From 2000-2023 other events not resulting in neurologic deficit included bloody spinal fluid (20.7% open; 21.7% endovascular); intracranial blood on CT without neurologic deficit (9.9% open; 6.1% endovascular); and headache requiring blood patch (7.6% open; 11.7% endovascular). From 2000-2023 5.6% of open patients had transient SCI; 4.2% had permanent SCI. 3.6% of endovascular patients had transient SCI; 1.2% had permanent SCI. Prophylactic SFD can be performed with acceptable risk in both endovascular and open TAAA repair. We advocate that prophylactic SFD be used to reduce risk of SCI in both endovascular and open TAAA repair."}

In a 12 week, randomized, open label, parallel group, two arm, comparative, multicentric, controlled trial compared WS with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in health care workers (HCWs). Total 400 HCWs were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either oral WS (500 mg for 12 weeks) or HCQ 400 mg (for 7 weeks). The primary outcome was to establish equivalence between WS and HCQ for the proportion of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven participants contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection: 5 in WS arm and 2 in HCQ arm. The equivalence between WS and HCQ was established for the proportion difference of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection for per-protocol (PP) (1.6%, 95% CI: -1.08%-4.33%) and in subgroup analysis (ITT, mIIT, non-vaccinated and seronegative). Notably, the immunomodulatory effect of WS stood scientifically validated by the statistically significant difference in cytokine levels (p < 0.0001) at 12 weeks compared to baseline for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were most frequent (53 in WS and 58 in HCQ). Headache and sneezing were observed only with HCQ. Participant global assessment showed excellent tolerability with both treatment arms. WS was found equivalent to HCQ as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 infection with no safety concern. WS is thus inferred to be an effective and safe Ayurvedic intervention for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also as an immunobooster."}

Mice were divided into five groups namely: control, NG-treated, NG + RA (20 mg/kg), NG + RA (40 mg/kg), and NG + sumatriptan. It was observed that NG administration led to reduced pain thresholds, increased head-scratching, photosensitivity, elevated nitrite levels, oxidative stress, and upregulated neuroinflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, CGRP). RA, particularly at 40 mg/kg, significantly reversed these effects by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing inflammation, and improving neuronal integrity. Histopathological analysis revealed reduced satellitosis and preserved cortical and trigeminal nucleus caudalis structures. These findings highlight RA's neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for migraine."}

However, many symptoms are non-specific and there is considerable variation in symptom reporting. It is essential to understand how rates of these symptoms compare to the pre-pandemic health of adolescents. A systematic search of academic literature and websites, using traditional and automated search systems, was undertaken to identify symptoms described in adolescents aged 10-19 years in the 30 years up to and including 2019. Studies were reviewed and symptom prevalence data extracted. Twenty-five sources (n = 483 097 participants) met the inclusion criteria, including longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs. The description and prevalence of symptoms varied widely, but there was a high pre-pandemic median prevalence of cough (13.6%), headache (30.0%), and fatigue (20.5%). These high prevalences highlight a gap in understanding of pre-pandemic adolescent health and the need for comprehensive, serial symptom profiling. These findings provide a baseline of adolescent symptomatology prior to the emergence of PCC and provide important context for interpreting ongoing COVID symptoms. Data on PCC in adolescents should consider pre-pandemic symptom prevalence."}

While surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms related to hydrocephalus or signs of tectal compression, most patients present with non-specific symptoms such as headaches, psychiatric disturbances, sleep dysregulation, dizziness, and fatigue, among others, where the role for surgery remains unclear. Although the etiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to these symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent pineal cyst resection at our center between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients presenting with hydrocephalus or concomitant conditions were excluded. Seven female patients (median age 27, range 19-42) were analyzed. The most common preoperative symptom was headaches, present in all patients, followed by fatigue, dizziness, memory problems, and psychiatric symptoms. Postoperatively, 85.7% (6/7) had complete headache resolution, while one (14.3%) had partial relief. Cognitive symptoms, including memory and concentration problems, improved in 66.6% (2/3) of cases, and psychiatric symptoms improved in 66% (4/6). The median follow-up was 24 months, with no new neurological deficits at the final follow-up. Surgical resection can lead to significant improvements in non-specific symptoms including headaches, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive issues in a subset of pineal cyst patients with severe refractory symptoms. These findings support the role of surgical intervention for such carefully selected patients and highlight the need for further investigation into the pathophysiology of these symptoms."}

Patients with SIH often experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory changes, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral analgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require advanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with refractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks. This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved (STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from September 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative Bern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative management underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of 52.1 \u00b1 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches (92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications were Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved significant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in headache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale scores (P < .01).

Pregnant women reported less often at least one AE compared to nonpregnant women (65.9% vs. 72.3%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67-0.90), more than one AE, or specific AEs: nausea, chills, pyrexia, and arthralgia. Myalgia was more often reported among pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women. Pregnant women perceived comparable or less often AEs after the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccination compared to nonpregnant women. The results aid pregnant women in making an informed decision about vaccination.

A cross-sectional survey was administered to final-year medical students from six universities located in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy between May and July 2024. The questionnaire (16 items) assessed the students' knowledge and attitudes toward acute pain management in pediatric patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. A total of 321 students completed the survey. The majority (49%) of students reported limited training (< 1 h) in pediatric pain management during their studies. Only 42% of respondents believed that neonates feel pain more intensively than adults, while 38% thought the same for children up to 3 years. old While 81% recognized that pediatric pain can be measured with age-specific tools, 60% would avoid using opioids for severe pain in children. Seventy-five percent of students reported routinely using analgesia before painful procedures, but 33% would not treat abdominal pain before surgical evaluation in a suspected appendicitis case. Conclusion: There are relevant gaps in the education of medical students on pediatric pain management in Italy. Traditional old views on pain are widespread among final-year medical students. Targeted educational interventions are needed to address these issues and ensure that future healthcare providers are adequately prepared to manage pediatric pain. What is Known \u2022 Pediatric pain is often undertreated due to misconceptions among healthcare providers about their pain perception and the long-term consequences of untreated pain. \u2022 Studies investigating knowledge and attitudes toward pediatric pain management have primarily focused on physicians or nurses, with limited evidence on medical students' preparation in this area.

This study will highlight the importance of treating ovarian torsion in a timely fashion in order to prevent undesirable complications, such as gangrene of the ovary, as seen in our patient's case. Gangrene and other necrotic processes can occur from ovarian torsion due to twisting of the ovary, thus causing a lack of blood supply, which is considered a gynecologic emergency. Once the ovary becomes gangrenous, it is no longer considered viable and treatment options can become limited, as surgical removal is almost always required. Additionally, important topics need to be addressed, such as epidemiology, pathology, and infertility. This is clinically relevant because it raises awareness to diagnose and treat ovarian torsions in a timely manner, to prevent unwanted outcomes, such as gangrenous ovaries or future infertility issues."}

Clinical examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory findings were unremarkable except for leukocytosis. Abdominal X-ray demonstrated features of small bowel obstruction, and CT imaging identified findings suggestive of a left paraduodenal hernia. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a large encapsulated peritoneal sac originating from the left paraduodenal region and extending into the pelvis. Dilated and edematous but viable small bowel loops were released, and adhesiolysis was performed. A planned second-look surgery two days later confirmed resolution of bowel edema, and the abdomen was closed without complications. Paraduodenal hernias arise from a congenital anomaly involving the mesentery and often present as intermittent or acute bowel obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms but can be facilitated by CT imaging. Definitive management involves surgical reduction and repair of the hernia, whether through open or laparoscopic approaches.

Disseminated cryptococcosis in children often presents with fever, respiratory and neurological symptoms, with the lungs, central nervous system, and lymph nodes being the most frequently involved organs. Most cases do not have immunodeficiency or underlying diseases, and blood tests often reveal eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels. The positive detection rates of pathogens are relatively high in blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow cultures, and lymph node biopsies. The majority of patients achieved favorable therapeutic outcomes with combination therapy."}

Additionally, we developed and validated a nomogram model for predicting the risk of SMPP. This retrospective cohort study included children diagnosed with M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) who were admitted to the West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University between September 2022 and February 2024. Data on demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and imaging findings were collected and analyzed. Compared to non-severe cases, children with SMPP had a significantly longer fever duration (8 days vs. 4 days, P < 0.001), higher peak body temperature (39.3 \u00b0C vs. 38.5 \u00b0C, P < 0.001), and a higher incidence of wheezing (13% vs. 0%, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in macrolide resistance rates between the groups (P > 0.05). Radiological analysis revealed a higher frequency of pulmonary consolidation (69% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) and pleural effusion (22% vs. 7%, P = 0.031) in the SMPP cohort. LASSO regression identified eight key predictors: fever duration, peak body temperature, wheezing, extrapulmonary complications, hemoglobin levels, pulmonary consolidation, mosaic sign, and bronchial occlusion. The nomogram demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with training and validation AUC values of 0.972 (95% CI 0.960-0.984) and 0.975 (95% CI 0.958-0.992), respectively. We developed and validated a nomogram for quantitative risk assessment of SMPP. This model can aid clinicians in the early identification of severe cases and in optimizing treatment strategies."}

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "fever", "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral infectious disease caused by a novel Bandavirus in the family Phenuiviridae. The SFTS virus (SFTSV) is transmitted to various hosts, including humans, through tick bites, leading to high fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, with a high case fatality rate (up to 30%) due to multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing disease transmission. In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize monoclonal antibodies targeting the SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). We generated recombinant NP to screen antibodies against SFTSV. Using phage display technology, we identified candidate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences capable of detecting SFTSV NP. Five human IgG antibodies and six chimeric mouse antibodies exhibited strong binding ability to the recombinant NP. Furthermore, their specificity and selectivity were evaluated against NPs from different subtypes and other viral species. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine optimal antibody pairings for SFTSV detection. The mP01A05/hP01C09, mP01A05/hP01B10, and mP02E04/hP01A05 antibody pairs demonstrated high efficacy in diagnosing SFTSV infections. These findings provide valuable antibody resources and establish an effective platform for the diagnosis of SFTS. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Monoclonal antibodies targeting SFTSV NP were developed using phage display technology. \u2022 Candidate antibodies showed strong binding ability and high specificity to SFTSV NP. \u2022 Optimized antibody pairs enabled effective SFTSV detection via sandwich ELISA."}

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated leptospirosis a nationally notifiable disease. There is need to raise awareness of the burden of leptospirosis among health care givers and policy makers in Africa. The aim of this review was to highlight the current situation of leptospirosis in Africa and suggest a One Health approach of addressing its status as a leading zoonosis. In tropical regions, the nonspecific symptoms of fever, myalgia and arthralgia result in misdiagnosis of leptospirosis with malaria, yellow fever, typhoid fever, dengue fever, brucellosis, rickettsiosis, and babesiosis. Urinalysis presents an inexpensive diagnostic aid for leptospirosis. Humans with leptospirosis exhibit proteinuria, glucosuria, pyuria, haematuria and granular casts resulting from acute kidney injury. Therapeutic guidelines for empirical treatment of febrile patients should be considered. Febrile patients who test negative for malaria and yellow fever can benefit from doxycycline, which also treats brucellosis, rickettsiosis and typhoid fever. Control of leptospirosis should also address Leptospira infection in domestic animal reservoirs through vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs in endemic areas. Treatment of sick animals with streptomycin eliminates the carrier status, curbing leptospiruria and spread of infection. Rodents are important in transmission of Leptospira to humans in urban slums and rural settings therefore rodent control strategies help in reducing transmission of leptospirosis. Indirect transmission of Leptospira occurs through contact with water, vegetation, or soil contaminated with infected urine.

Timely identification and reporting by disease surveillance officers are critical in preventing and controlling outbreaks. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and self-efficacy of disease surveillance officers in identifying and reporting yellow fever cases in Kwara State, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey of 177 disease surveillance officers, was conducted in Kwara State, Nigeria, between June 2023 and December 2023. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 365 and SPSS 20. The study revealed that 82.5% of respondents demonstrated good knowledge of yellow fever, while 99.4% showed good self-efficacy in detecting and reporting cases. However, gaps in knowledge and practice were identified, particularly regarding the mode of transmission and epidemic threshold. Continuous training, retraining and regular updates on yellow fever epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control measures should be provided to disease surveillance officers.

Mozambique is located in a region that is prone to climate change-related devastation, including heavy rainfalls and severe droughts that favor the emergence of zoonotic viruses transmitted by arthropods such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae, CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus riftense, RVFV). Both viruses are closely associated with livestock farming, including cattle, and can cause symptoms of hemorrhagic fever in humans. Available previous data sets related to the presence of RVFV and especially CCHFV in Mozambique are rather scarce. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the recent seroprevalence of both viruses in cattle in four localities of Limpopo National Park. In addition, ticks were collected and tested for the presence of different arboviruses. A total of 460 cattle blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of CCHFV and RVFV antibodies using ID Screen CCHF Double Antigen Multi-species (IgM/IgG) and ID Screen Rift Valley Fever Competition Multi-species commercial ELISA test kits (IDvet, Grabels, France), respectively. 1176 ticks were collected from the same animals and analyzed with different RT-qPCRs assays for CCHFV, Nairobi sheep disease virus (Orthonairovirus nairobiense, NSDV) virus and Dugbe virus (Orthonairovirus dugbeense, DUGV). Selected ticks were further screened by using a pan-Flavivirus melting curve PCR. The overall seroprevalence was higher for CCHFV (50%) compared to RVFV (28%). While a significant difference in seroprevalence between age groups was only found for CCHFV, there was a difference in RVFV seroprevalence between sampling sites that was not observed for CCHFV. None of the viruses tested were found inside the ticks. This study revealed the presence of anti-CCHFV and anti-RVFV antibodies in cattle from all four sampled localities suggesting that both viruses are circulating in cattle and may be an important cause of unidentified febrile illness in humans in the region."}

The Patient Perspective of Arrhythmia Questionnaire (PPAQ) was initially developed as a self-administered, disease-specific PROM for patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) assessing the impact of the arrhythmia and symptoms on patients' daily activities and physical, emotional, and social functioning. Preliminary evidence of content and construct validity has been previously demonstrated, but only in SVT patients in the U.S. and Poland. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the concurrent validity of the PPAQ in patients having a variety of arrhythmias and to explore whether differences in symptoms existed by gender. In this cross-sectional study, adult cardiac arrhythmia outpatients from a tertiary care, academic medical center completed the 6-item PPAQ, the SF-12, a Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Included were patients with atrial fibrillation (82.4%), ventricular tachycardia (15.7%), and atrial tachycardia (2%). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, pairwise comparisons with Pearson correlations, Goodman Kruskal gamma statistic for ordinal associations, Cronbach's alpha, and Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) were used to determine concurrent construct validity and internal consistency reliability. Participants (n=51) had a mean age of 59.4 years (\u00b1 12.6), were majority male (66.7%) and Caucasian (75%). Preliminary evidence of concurrent construct validity was found based on moderate to strong correlations (range from 0.4 to 0.7) between the PPAQ and other validated measures, as well as strong internal reliability (KR-20 of 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.91). The most common symptoms reported were fatigue (60.8%) and heart fluttering (52.9%). Blurred vision (p<0.04), dizziness (p<0.01), and fatigue (p<0.04) were seen significantly more frequently in men compared to women. Results present additional evidence of the validity and reliability of the PPAQ. The PPAQ comprehensively measures the burden of the disease from cardiac arrhythmia patients' perspective.

While often associated with pre-existing adenomas, it may also occur in previously normal glands. Risk factors include surgery, pregnancy, and medications such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which are rarely implicated in pituitary apoplexy. We present the case of a 59-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer who developed intractable headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and blurred vision shortly after receiving a leuprolide, GnRH agonist injection, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Brain imaging revealed a sellar and suprasellar pituitary tumor with hemorrhage. He was treated with intravenous fluids and steroids. The patient underwent emergent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy surgery, and pathology confirmed a gonadotroph adenoma with necrosis. The patient was discharged in stable condition. Pituitary apoplexy following GnRH agonist therapy is exceedingly rare, with fewer than 30 cases reported in the public domain. Proposed mechanisms include sudden cell shrinkage and metabolic hyperactivity within the pituitary gland. This case underscores the importance of recognizing the clinical presentation of pituitary apoplexy, as timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing severe neurological and endocrine sequelae. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for pituitary apoplexy in patients presenting with acute neurological or endocrine symptoms following GnRH agonist therapy. Increased awareness and vigilance in at-risk populations are essential, as routine pre-screening for pituitary adenomas is not currently standard practice."}

A 33-year-old male, recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 count: 158/\u00b5L), presented with floaters and blurred vision. Fundus examination revealed bilateral peripheral occlusive vasculitis with blot hemorrhages and macular edema. Anterior chamber fluid analysis via PCR revealed a high viral load of human adenovirus (HAdV) and tested negative for other common viral causes of retinal necrosis. Initial treatment involved topical corticosteroids, intravitreal ganciclovir, and systemic valganciclovir. Due to disease progression, therapy was subsequently escalated to high-dose valacyclovir (2 g TID) with intravitreal ganciclovir and later intravenous cidofovir was introduced. Despite initial worsening, the addition of cidofovir resulted in gradual lesion resolution over 4 weeks, leaving peripheral retinal necrosis. The final best-corrected visual acuity improved to 6/6 (right eye) and 6/8 (left eye), with residual macular ischemia. Concurrent antiretroviral therapy led to immune reconstitution with an increase in CD4 counts to 580/\u00b5L. Notably, a distinctive pattern of schisis-associated macular edema (SAME) was observed. Adenoviral necrotizing retinitis remains an underrecognized entity, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

This condition is classified into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. The most frequent infectious agents in anterior uveitis are viruses, mainly Herpes simplex virus, although it can also be caused by other pathogens such as Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Fusarium spp. In intermediate uveitis, syphilis plays a predominant role, while in posterior uveitis various microorganisms are involved, among them Toxoplasma gondii, Cytomegalovirus, Plasmodium spp. and Candida spp. In certain cases, as in ocular toxoplasmosis, severe inflammation may involve the entire uvea, resulting in panuveitis. Clinical manifestations of uveitis include ocular pain, redness, myodesopsias, blurred vision, and even loss of vision. Direct identification of the causative agent is complex, and the diagnostic performance of available tests varies significantly. For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on ocular specimens for Herpes simplex virus has a sensitivity of 91.3% and specificity of 98.8%, while for toxoplasmosis the sensitivity is 43.1% and specificity 98.5%. Another challenge in infectious uveitis is treatment, as systemic antimicrobials generally have a low penetration into ocular tissue, mostly less than 5%, mainly due to the blood-retinal and blood-aqueous barriers. The efficacy of the molecules in ocular tissue is favored by low protein binding and high liposolubility. This review addresses the most frequent clinical manifestations of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal etiologies of infectious uveitis, as well as the diagnostic performance of available tests.

Clinical characteristics, multimodal imaging findings, laboratory evaluations, genetic testing, natural history, therapeutic management, and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. Specific multimodal imaging signatures of AOR were identified, including findings from ophthalmoscopy, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Humphrey visual field testing, full-field electroretinography (ERG), and multifocal ERG were analyzed. Baseline features and the natural course of the disease were delineated. Thirty-eight eyes from 23 patients were analyzed. Presenting symptoms included photopsia (87%), blurred vision (57%), and scotoma (57%). On ophthalmoscopy, AOR was acutely characterized by yellow-greyish outer retinal lesions corresponding to hyperautofluorescent changes on FAF and the angular sign of Henle fiber layer hyperreflectivity (ASHH) on OCT. FAF imaging revealed ring-like hyperautofluorescent lesions surrounding the optic disc in 18% of eyes. Additional lesion patterns on FAF included perivenular (53%), sectoral (16%), and spot-like distributions (13%). FA and ICGA findings were mostly unremarkable. Lesion progression primarily occurred within the initial weeks following presentation and stabilized in size beyond this period in the majority of eyes. Over time, affected areas progressed to outer retinal atrophy with pigmentary changes. Foveal sparing was observed in 68% of the eyes. None of the therapeutic interventions appeared effective in halting the progression to complete outer retinal atrophy or preventing lesion enlargement. AOR is characterized by early photoreceptor disruption, evidenced by ASHH on OCT, leading to rapid outer retinal atrophy and subsequent degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium within the damaged zones.

Untreated uveitis may cause cataracts, glaucoma, macular edema, retinal detachment, optic nerve damage, and vision loss. Uveitis predominantly affects individuals aged 20 to 50 years. Anterior uveitis affects the iris and ciliary body (41%-60% of cases); intermediate uveitis affects the pars plana (attachment point of vitreous humor) and peripheral retina (9%-15%); posterior uveitis involves the choroid and/or retina (17%-23%); and panuveitis involves all uveal layers (7%-32%). Uveitis is classified as noninfectious or infectious, with toxoplasmosis, herpes, tuberculosis, and HIV comprising 11% to 21% of infectious cases in high-income countries and 50% in low- and middle-income countries. Incidence and prevalence of uveitis are influenced by genetic factors (eg, human leukocyte antigen-B27), environmental factors (eg, air pollution), and infection rates. In the US and Europe, 27% to 51% of uveitis cases are idiopathic, and 37% to 49% are associated with systemic disease, such as axial spondyloarthritis. Treatment goals are to induce and maintain remission while minimizing corticosteroid use to reduce corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Infectious uveitis requires systemic antimicrobial treatment. Active inflammatory disorders associated with uveitis should be treated by the appropriate specialist (eg, rheumatologist). Treatment for uveitis depends on subtype; anterior uveitis is treated with topical corticosteroids, and mild intermediate uveitis may be monitored without initial treatment. Patients with moderate to severe intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis are at high risk of sight-threatening complications and require systemic and/or intravitreal corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. For posterior uveitis, first-line therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate achieved remission of inflammation in 52.1% (95% CI, 38.6%-67.1%) of patients, and mycophenolate mofetil controlled inflammation in 70.9% (95% CI, 57.1%-83.5%). In patients who do not improve or worsen with first-line therapy, adalimumab extended time to treatment failure to 24 weeks vs 13 weeks with placebo and reduced frequency of treatment failure from 78.5% to 54.5% (P < .001). Uveitis is characterized by inflammation of the uvea and primarily affects adults aged 20 to 50 years. For noninfectious anterior uveitis, corticosteroid eyedrops are first-line treatment. For posterior noninfectious uveitis, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are first-line therapy; biologics such as adalimumab are second-line treatment for patients with inflammation refractory to treatment.

The transcranial doppler bubble test showed a rain curtain-like right-to-left shunt in a resting state, and ultrasound contrast indicated a right-to-left shunt at the level of the atria. MRI indicated a patient infarction site in the right temporal lobe and occipital cortex, and hemorrhage within the infarcted lesion. Surgery for PFO occlusion was performed on June 8, 2023.Two subcutaneous injections of low-molecular-weight heparin were administered postoperatively for anticoagulant therapy with 12-hour intervals between 2 shots, and aspirin and clopidogrel were administered for antiplatelet therapy. The patient's condition improved significantly after the operation. During the 3-month follow-up, postoperative cardiac ultrasonography showed that the shape and position of the occluders were normal, and no obvious shunt was found at the atrial level after PFO closure. Dizziness and blurred vision in both eyes returned to normal. The patient's condition was stable, with no symptoms of neurological deficits. As a result, clopidogrel was discontinued. The transcranial doppler bubble test, a key test for clinical screening of PFO-related stroke, is easy to operate, highly sensitive, less costly, and causes less pain. Combined with ultrasound contrast, it can rapidly identify whether a PFO exists."}

Typical symptoms in more severe cases include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, persistent coughing, excessive mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Current therapies, which focus on suppressing the immune system, mitigate the symptoms but are generally insufficient to address the disease. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) platform, initially developed as an attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), induces a potent T helper type 1 (Th1) polarized immune response, making it a promising candidate for treating Th2-dominant conditions, such as allergic asthma, ultimately alleviating the symptoms. BCG can be genetically modified to express antigens of other pathogens or immunogenic proteins, such as IL-12p70. In this review, we examine the potential of BCG as a novel therapeutic platform for allergic asthma, focusing on its ability to modulate the immune response via IL-12."}

We investigated changes in motor output of mechanically induced cough during a repeated stimulation protocol, as may occur during aspiration of food / liquid over a meal. The occurrence, magnitude, phase durations, and power spectra characteristics of diaphragm and abdominal muscle electromyograms, and esophageal pressures during coughing were recorded during repeated mechanical stimulation of the trachea in cats. After the initial increase in cough excitability, repeated tracheal stimulation resulted in reduced cough number, electromyograms and esophageal pressure magnitudes, which fit an exponential model. There was little change in cough phase durations. Additionally, a pause in sequential airway stimulation (lasting several minutes) resulted in a further cough reduction, associated with prolongation of cough phase durations, but was resolved after one additional stimulus trial, consistent with long-latency transient depression. Power spectral analysis suggested changes in recruitment of motor units for parasternal muscles and no signs of fatigue although hundreds of coughs were executed. Our results are consistent with the presence of central adaptive mechanisms that can regulate the excitability of repetitive coughing, likely overlapping with transient potentiation and depression. The results have mechanistic implications for predicting airway protective responses in respiratory diseases."}

The objective of this study is to examine changes in symptoms and physical activity among lung cancer patients and their short-term predictive relationship. Ninety-six lung cancer patients (average age 59.70) were selected. Symptoms (pain, fatigue, distress, cough, dyspnea, and sleepiness) were monitored three times daily from preoperative to postoperative day 6 using the Ecological Momentary Assessment. Step count was continuously monitored via a smartwatch. Short-term trends in symptoms and step count were analyzed. A hierarchical linear model was used to examine the immediate and lagged correlations between symptoms and step count, with confounders controlled. Symptoms and step counts showed fluctuation with a jagged changing trajectory. Step count decreased significantly when symptoms were worse than the individual average (P < 0.001), except for cough. Symptoms were significantly reduced when step count significantly increased (P < 0.001). Pain (\u03b2 = - 73.384, P < 0.001) had a negative predictive effect on step count at the next moment, after controlling for step count. Step count at the same time had a significant effect on alleviating pain (\u03b2 = - 0.0002, P < 0.05), fatigue (\u03b2 = - 0.0003, P < 0.05), and sleepiness (\u03b2 = - 0.0003, P < 0.001), next moment, after controlling for symptoms.

However, many symptoms are non-specific and there is considerable variation in symptom reporting. It is essential to understand how rates of these symptoms compare to the pre-pandemic health of adolescents. A systematic search of academic literature and websites, using traditional and automated search systems, was undertaken to identify symptoms described in adolescents aged 10-19 years in the 30 years up to and including 2019. Studies were reviewed and symptom prevalence data extracted. Twenty-five sources (n = 483 097 participants) met the inclusion criteria, including longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs. The description and prevalence of symptoms varied widely, but there was a high pre-pandemic median prevalence of cough (13.6%), headache (30.0%), and fatigue (20.5%). These high prevalences highlight a gap in understanding of pre-pandemic adolescent health and the need for comprehensive, serial symptom profiling. These findings provide a baseline of adolescent symptomatology prior to the emergence of PCC and provide important context for interpreting ongoing COVID symptoms.

As a traditional Chinese medicine, Inula japonica Thunb. is used mainly to treat cough and phlegm. 1-O-Acetylbritannilactone (ABL), one of the main ingredients in I. japonica, may be an anti-inflammatory and anti-MUC5AC drug candidate. ABL significantly decreased the production of NO and the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Network pharmacology suggested that ABL might inhibit inflammation and MUC5AC expression, and EGFR, MAPK, SRC, and PKC-\u03b1 might be key proteins involved. The results of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, CETSA and MST suggested that ABL interacted with PKC-\u03b1, indicating that PKC-\u03b1 was a target of ABL. ABL reduced the expression of the SRC/EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway in PMA-induced NCI-H292 cells and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In animal experiments, ABL significantly ameliorated COPD in mice by improving pulmonary function, suppressing oxidative stress, and decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in lung tissue. The results of the phenol red test showed that ABL had a significant expectorant effect. In conclusion, ABL exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-MUC5AC effects by targeting PKC-\u03b1 and downregulating the SRC/EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway.

Although many works propose algorithms to automate this task, they suffer of poor data privacy and short-term monitoring. Edge-AI is a promising paradigm to overcome these limitations by processing privacy-sensitive data close to their source. However, it presents challenges for the deployment of resource-demanding algorithms on constrained devices. In this work, we propose a hardware-aware methodology for developing a cough detection algorithm, analyzing design-time trade-offs for performance and energy. From audio and kinematic signals, our methodology aims at optimal features via Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), exploiting the explainability of the selected XGB model. Additionally, it analyzes the use of Mel spectrogram features, instead of the common MFCC. Moreover, a set of hyperparameters for a multimodal implementation of the classifier is explored. Finally, it evaluates the performance based on clinically relevant event-based metrics. The methodology proposes a novel structured approach to efficiently deploy AI on the edge, preserving data privacy. We apply our methodology to develop Cough-E, an energy-efficient, multimodal, and edge AI cough detector. It exploits audio and kinematic data in two distinct models, cooperating for a balanced energy and performance trade-off. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be executed in real-time on an ARM Cortex M33 microcontroller. Cough-E achieves a 70.56% energy saving compared to the audio-only approach, for a 1.26% relative performance drop, resulting in a 0.78 F1-score. Both Cough-E and the edge-aware model optimization methodology are available as open-source code. This approach demonstrates the benefits of the proposed hardware-aware methodology to enable privacy-preserving cough monitors on the edge, paving the way to efficient cough monitoring."}

M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory of lung cancer module (MDASI-LC) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to measured physical and psychological symptoms at the time of pre-radiotherapy, the end of radiotherapy, and 4 weeks after radiotherapy, respectively. Network analysis was performed using R software version 4.3.2 to identify the core symptoms. A total of 234 lung cancer survivors are treated with radiotherapy; participants were included with an average age of 59.2 years, predominantly male (78.2%), representing various lung cancer subtypes and stages. Before radiotherapy, poor appetite was identified as the core symptom. At the end of radiotherapy, shortness of breath emerged as the central symptom, likely driven by radiation-induced respiratory complications. Four weeks after radiotherapy, fatigue became the most significant symptom. Psychological networks revealed depressive symptoms of lack of optimism as core before radiotherapy, panic as central at the end of treatment, and tension as predominant post-radiotherapy. This study highlights the dynamic evolution of core symptoms in lung cancer survivors undergoing radiotherapy. Findings underscore the importance of early interventions targeting appetite and psychological distress, as well as post-treatment strategies to address fatigue and emotional tension. Integrating physical and psychological care through symptom network analysis can guide personalized management approaches, improving patient quality of life and treatment outcomes.

Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying this disease remain unknown. Recently, a close association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and thrombosis has been detected, with the risk of venous thrombosis complications increasing after COVID-19 infection; however, few studies have reported on the association between COVID-19 and CTEPH.

Traditional management strategies focused on symptom mitigation and sudden cardiac death prevention among high-risk patients. The only disease-modifying treatments have historically been septal reduction therapy or heart transplantation. However, cardiac myosin inhibitors have emerged as promising novel pharmacotherapies. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac myosin inhibitors as well as surgical myectomy result in not only symptomatic benefit and reduction in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, but also positive cardiac remodeling including reduction in left ventricular mass and maximum wall thickness, improved left ventricular diastolic parameters, reduced left atrial volumes, and improved left atrial strain. The long-term durability and clinical significance of these findings require further study. In this article, we will review the existing evidence of favorable reverse remodeling conferred by cardiac myosin inhibitors and surgical myectomy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition resulting in thickening of the heart muscle and muscle stiffness which can cause symptoms varying from shortness of breath to sudden death. Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs when the thickened muscle causes blockage of the blood flow out of the heart. Treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has traditionally been used to minimize symptoms and conventional medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide do not significantly change the underlying disease process. A new class of medications called cardiac myosin inhibitors including mavacamten and aficamten have emerged which decrease symptoms and improve the obstruction. Surgical myectomy, in which a portion of the thickened muscle causing obstruction is surgically cut out, also improves symptoms and mortality. Recent evidence demonstrates that these cardiac myosin inhibitors as well as surgical myectomy may not only improve symptoms but also result in the heart undergoing physical changes that reverse some of the abnormalities associated with this condition. Future studies are needed to determine whether these physical changes result in improved patient outcomes."}

Incorporating ECG-AI into preHEART led to a significant improvement in diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.83 (0.79 to 0.86), p<0.001). Correctly identifying patients who are at low risk for having NSTE-ACS is crucial for optimal triage in the prehospital setting. Recent studies have shown that these low-risk patients could potentially be left at home or transferred to a general practitioner, leading to less emergency department overcrowding and lower healthcare costs. Other studies demonstrated better overall diagnostic performance compared with our artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, these studies were aimed at a study population with a high prevalence of occlusive myocardial infarction, which could explain the differing levels of diagnostic performance. Integrating AI in prehospital ECG interpretation improves the identification of patients at low risk for having NSTE-ACS. Nonetheless, clinical risk scores currently yield the best diagnostic performance and their accuracy could be further enhanced through AI. Our results pave the way for new studies focused on exploring the role of AI in prehospital risk-stratification efforts."}

We analyzed register data covering the entire adult Norwegian population, examining individuals experiencing their first MI, sourced from the Norwegian MI register between January 2013 and December 2017. Only patients without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were analyzed. Outcomes were compared between IJD and non-IJD groups using logistic regression and generalized linear models, in age-adjusted models stratified by sex. Our cohort included 981 RA patients, 314 axSpA patients, 434 PsA patients and 34,783 non-IJD individuals experiencing a first MI. Chest pain was the most common symptom in all groups, and there was no indication that IJD subgroups experienced atypical presentations more often than non-IJD. Myocardial damage indicators - ST-elevation MI rates, troponin T levels and multi-vessel disease - were not worse in IJD patients. Acute treatments were equally, or more, often performed in IJD compared to non-IJD individuals. All in-hospital adverse events and short-term mortality were similar or less common in the IJD subgroups compared to non-IJD patients. None of the secondary cardio-preventive drugs were prescribed less frequently to IJD patients than to non-IJD. RA, axSpA and PsA patients showed comparable MI presentations, disease courses and short-term outcomes to those without IJD. These findings should provide reassurance about the short-term prognosis of IJD patients experiencing MI."}

A lung biopsy confirmed lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with mixed solid and lepidic growth patterns, showing 80% PD-L1 expression. Positron emission tomography (PET) identified a highly active lesion in the left eye, suggestive of retinal metastasis. Ophthalmologic evaluation confirmed retinal involvement. Given ROS1 positivity, Crizotinib was initially prescribed but switched to Lorlatinib due to concerns regarding retinal involvement. The patient demonstrated rapid clinical improvement, including notable visual recovery, with stable performance status after 1 month. This case underscores LUAD's potential for atypical metastasis, such as to the retina, necessitating comprehensive assessment and personalised management strategies.

However, the association between these risk factors and CTS under conditions of cumulative exposure to the risk factors remains unclear. In this study, we utilized a cumulative risk score to assess the prevalence level of CTS , and further evaluated the interactions between different risk factors and their cumulative association with CTS. Specifically, we first conducted a univariate regression analysis to evaluate the independent association of risk factors with CTS. Then we ran the multivariate regression model to filter out significant risk factors from risk factors associated with CTS. Next, we constructed the risk score to represent the cumulative association of significant risk factors with CTS, and we analyzed the relationship between the risk score and the prevalence level of CTS. The experiment results demonstrated that among the various personal factors, sex, age, BMI, sleep disorder, smoking frequency, restlessness, diabetes, kidney failure, arthritis, and joint pain were the most significant factors related to CTS. There existed the cumulative association of risk factors with CTS, and the cumulative association of risk factors was positively related with an increased prevalence level of CTS. Moreover, there existed a critical threshold (risk score = 3) for the increase in the prevalence level of CTS. Our study reveals the significant risk factors among personal factors related with CTS, and presents the cumulative association of these risk factors with CTS. Moreover, we offer the actionable suggestions for CTS prevention based on the experiment results. The occurrence of CTS is associated with various risk factors. Identifying the independent and cumulative association of different risk factors is essential for designing effective preventive measures and interventions for CTS.

Univariate negative binomial regression models were applied to identify differences in the frequency of secondary healthcare contacts due to musculoskeletal pain in the 12 months following app download. Results were reported as incidence rate ratios (IRRs). We observed higher utilization of secondary healthcare among females (IRR 1.32 (95 %CI 1.19-1.46)), older (IRR 1.03 (95 %CI 1.02-1.03)), those with short-cycle higher education (IRR 1.91 (95 %CI 1.61-2.26)), residents of the Region of Southern Denmark (IRR 1.82 (95 %CI 1.48-2.24)), those experiencing hip pain (IRR 1.63 (95 %CI 1.33-2.00)), and those with long-term pain (IRR 2.31 (95 %CI 2.06-2.62)). By contrast, lower rates of secondary healthcare utilization were noted among app users with higher musculoskeletal health status (IRR 0.95, (95 %CI 0.95-0.96)). These comparisons are relative to app users who are male, younger, live in the North Denmark Region, have neck pain, and experience pain <1 month.

Data from the previous Italian retrospective, observational, multicenter \"PERampanel as Only Concomitant Antiseizure Medication\" (PEROC) study were analyzed, categorizing patients by baseline seizure frequency into three groups: < 5, 5-20, and > 20 seizures/month. Retention, responder (\u2265 50% seizure reduction) rates, seizure-free rates and adverse events (AEs) were analyzed. Sub-analyses examined early (\u2264 1 previous ASM) vs. late (> 2 previous ASMs) add-on groups. The sample included 485 patients with focal and generalized epilepsy: 354 with < 5 seizures/month, 79 with 5-20, and 52 with > 20 seizures/month. Retention rates at 12 months were 75.1%, 68%, and 58.1.7%, respectively. Perampanel significantly reduced seizure frequency in all groups, with responder rates of 71.2%, 61.8%, and 63.2% at the 12-month follow-up. Patients with more frequent seizures (> 20 and 5-20 seizures/month) had lower seizure-free rates (15.8% and 23.5%) compared to those with < 5 seizures/month (49.5%, p = 0.001). AEs, mainly dizziness and irritability occurred in 30% of patients, without significant differences between groups (p = 0.092).

The Patient Perspective of Arrhythmia Questionnaire (PPAQ) was initially developed as a self-administered, disease-specific PROM for patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) assessing the impact of the arrhythmia and symptoms on patients' daily activities and physical, emotional, and social functioning. Preliminary evidence of content and construct validity has been previously demonstrated, but only in SVT patients in the U.S. and Poland. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the concurrent validity of the PPAQ in patients having a variety of arrhythmias and to explore whether differences in symptoms existed by gender. In this cross-sectional study, adult cardiac arrhythmia outpatients from a tertiary care, academic medical center completed the 6-item PPAQ, the SF-12, a Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Included were patients with atrial fibrillation (82.4%), ventricular tachycardia (15.7%), and atrial tachycardia (2%). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, pairwise comparisons with Pearson correlations, Goodman Kruskal gamma statistic for ordinal associations, Cronbach's alpha, and Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) were used to determine concurrent construct validity and internal consistency reliability. Participants (n=51) had a mean age of 59.4 years (\u00b1 12.6), were majority male (66.7%) and Caucasian (75%). Preliminary evidence of concurrent construct validity was found based on moderate to strong correlations (range from 0.4 to 0.7) between the PPAQ and other validated measures, as well as strong internal reliability (KR-20 of 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.91). The most common symptoms reported were fatigue (60.8%) and heart fluttering (52.9%). Blurred vision (p<0.04), dizziness (p<0.01), and fatigue (p<0.04) were seen significantly more frequently in men compared to women. Results present additional evidence of the validity and reliability of the PPAQ. The PPAQ comprehensively measures the burden of the disease from cardiac arrhythmia patients' perspective. Validated, reliable, disease-specific PROMs are needed to direct personalized clinical decision-making."}

Although the etiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the habenula, which is anatomically and functionally linked to the pineal gland, may contribute to these symptoms through its role in circadian rhythms, pain modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent pineal cyst resection at our center between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients presenting with hydrocephalus or concomitant conditions were excluded. Seven female patients (median age 27, range 19-42) were analyzed. The most common preoperative symptom was headaches, present in all patients, followed by fatigue, dizziness, memory problems, and psychiatric symptoms. Postoperatively, 85.7% (6/7) had complete headache resolution, while one (14.3%) had partial relief. Cognitive symptoms, including memory and concentration problems, improved in 66.6% (2/3) of cases, and psychiatric symptoms improved in 66% (4/6). The median follow-up was 24 months, with no new neurological deficits at the final follow-up. Surgical resection can lead to significant improvements in non-specific symptoms including headaches, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive issues in a subset of pineal cyst patients with severe refractory symptoms. These findings support the role of surgical intervention for such carefully selected patients and highlight the need for further investigation into the pathophysiology of these symptoms."}

Patients with SIH often experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, dizziness, visual and auditory changes, and cognitive impairment. While initial treatment includes oral analgesics, rest, and epidural blood patching, refractory cases may require advanced diagnostics and surgical intervention to repair the CSF leak. The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and outcomes of patients with refractory SIH who underwent surgical repair for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks. This retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved (STUDY00007663), single-institution study reviewed patients with SIH because of spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who underwent surgery by a single surgeon from September 2022 to June 2024. Demographics, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected through chart review. Preoperative and postoperative Bern scores, derived from brain MRIs, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Among 138 patients diagnosed with SIH, 50 refractory to conservative management underwent surgical repair. The surgical cohort had an average age of 52.1 \u00b1 13.9 years, with 64% female. Presenting symptoms included headaches (92%), pain/numbness (46%), and nausea/vomiting (46%). CSF leak classifications were Type I (38%), Type II (10%), and Type III (52%). Postsurgery, 96% achieved significant symptom resolution or improvement, with notable reductions in headache frequency (P < .01), Bern scores (P < .01), and Visual Analog Scale scores (P < .01). Surgical repair is crucial for managing refractory SIH, with tailored techniques based on leak type and location.

AEs and management were recorded from follow-up and emergency room visits. Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure assessed significance and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Three hundred ten AGA patients were analyzed with mean age 47.5 years and 53.2% females. The average LDOM dose was lower for females vs. males. AEs were observed in 14.9% of patients, with dizziness/lightheadedness, hypertrichosis, and extremity edema being most common. Higher doses were associated with increased likelihood of dizziness/lightheadedness. Females had higher overall incidence of AEs; however, gender differences did not persist after subgroup analysis. Among patients experiencing AEs, 11.1% adjusted their dosage and 28.9% discontinued treatment. A higher LDOM dose increased risk of dizziness/lightheadedness in both genders, with females more likely to experience any AE. Patients are often started at inappropriately high doses, causing AE-induced regimen changes.

For this purpose, plant cultivation was conducted in May 2020 as a completely random design. After one year of establishment, foliar spraying was conducted at the beginning of flowering, the peak of flowering, and the end of flowering at the levels of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L, and the control of iron and silver nanoparticles. After collecting and drying the leaves, the essential oil was extracted by water distillation, and the compounds were identified by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of essential oils was evaluated by using agar diffusion method, Minimum growth inhibitory concentration, and Minimum concentration of bacterial lethality. The results showed that foliar spraying with different nano iron and silver treatments had a significant effect on the yield, percentage of compounds, and antimicrobial activity of M. officinalis leaf essential oil (p \u2264 0.01).

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data was collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 patients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed other short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse events (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included independent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared with the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we found that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a significant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI \u2265 30. Among secondary outcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved postoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital stay.

For this reason, guidelines for treating depression mainly focus on how to proceed in cases of treatment failure or only partial response. The aim of this review paper is to present studies evaluating the effectiveness of vortioxetine in treatment of patients with depression following treatment failure with an SSRI/SNRI drug. Vortioxetine is an effective antidepressant that, after treatment failure with an SSRI/SNRI drug, allows 32-55% of patients to achieve remission. However, the assessed dosing regimen of vortioxetine deviated from that used in the initial therapy of depression, i.e. by the second week (8th day) of therapy the dose was increased to the maximum - 20 mg/day and the period for treatment effectiveness assessment was 8-12 weeks. This dosing regimen more closely resembles the pharmacological approach utilised in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder rather than depression. The administration of a high dose of vortioxetine did not negatively impact the tolerability of the treatment, even among patient groups at high risk of adverse events (elderly patients, co-existence of anxiety). The most common adverse effect was nausea; however, it was not observed that rapid dose escalation intensified this effect. This is most likely attributable to the receptor profile of vortioxetine."}

Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia have been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are included in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, since total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive organs and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, do these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint arthroplasty surgery? This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data was collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 patients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed other short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse events (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included independent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared with the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we found that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a significant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI \u2265 30. Among secondary outcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved postoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital stay. Although the combination of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia did not show broad effectiveness in reducing PONV after TKA, it offered significant benefits for obese patients by reducing insulin resistance and decreasing PONV.

Calf diarrhea, being the main contributor to calf morbidity and mortality, is a major issue within the livestock sector in Ethiopia. However, studies on viruses and the virome in calves is lacking in the country. Therefore, we utilized viral metagenomics to investigate the diversity of RNA viruses in healthy and diarrheic calves from central Ethiopia. Fecal material from 47 calves were collected, pooled, and sequenced using Illumina. Following sequencing, the virome composition and individual viral sequences were investigated using bioinformatic analysis. The metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of several RNA viruses, including rotavirus and bovine coronavirus, known causative agents in calf diarrhea. In addition, several enteric RNA viruses that have not been detected in cattle in Ethiopia previously, such as norovirus, nebovirus, astrovirus, torovirus, kobuvirus, enterovirus, boosepivirus and hunnivirus were identified. Furthermore, a highly divergent viral sequence, which we gave the working name suluvirus, was found. Suluvirus showed a similar genome structure to viruses within the Picornaviridae family and phylogenetic analysis showed that it clusters with crohiviruses. However, due to its very divergent amino acid sequence, we propose that suluvirus represent either a new genus within the Picornaviridae or a new species within crohiviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the RNA virome in Ethiopian cattle and the study revealed multiple RNA viruses circulating in both diarrheic and healthy calves, as well as a putative novel virus, suluvirus.

A 1-year interim analysis of a prospective, multicenter observational study was conducted in Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan. This study included 215 patients with early-stage IPF (stage I/II per the Japanese IPF severity system) who were followed up for 52 weeks. Changes in FVC and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco); incidence of adverse events, acute exacerbations, and death; and factors associated with FVC decline and nintedanib discontinuation were evaluated. The percentage of predicted FVC (%FVC) remained stable, from 83.2% at baseline to 83.7% at 52 weeks, while %DLco decreased from 70.8% to 64.2%. Incidences of acute exacerbation and death were both 4.7%. Nintedanib was discontinued due to adverse events in 21.9% of the patients. Risk factors for FVC decline (>5%) included female sex, GAP stage II/III, low oxygen saturation (SpO The findings of this interim analysis indicate that nintedanib has good efficacy, safety, and tolerability for early-stage IPF in real-world settings, outside randomized control trials."}
{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "diarrhea", "text": "Porcine group A rotavirus (RVA) is a significant causative agent of diarrhea in piglets, leading to substantial economic losses in pig farms worldwide. While horizontal transmission of RVA among pig populations is well documented, the possibility of vertical transmission from sows to newborn piglets has not been definitively confirmed. In this study, piglet testicles, umbilical cord blood, and colostrum were collected from porcine RVA (PoRVA)-active farms for analysis. The samples presented high PoRVA-positive rates, with 70.00% in the testicle samples, 55.00% in the umbilical cord blood samples, and 73.33% in the colostrum samples. Immunohistochemical assays confirmed the presence of PoRVA in neonatal piglet testicles. Additionally, two PoRVA strains, RVA/Pig/CHN/QT/2023/G9P [23] (QT2023) and RVA/Pig/CHN/BH/2023/G12P [7] (BH2023), were isolated from newborn piglet testicles. Complete genome analyses revealed that strains QT2023 and BH2023 both presented a Wa-like backbone, with the genotype constellation of G9-P [23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G12-P [7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, respectively. While strains QT2023 and BH2023 originated from PoRVAs, sequence identities and phylogenetic analyses suggested close relationships with human rotaviruses in specific genes. Furthermore, successful viral replication of these strains in MA-104 cells was observed. Inoculation of PoRVA-negative piglets with strains QT2023 and BH2023 resulted in clinical diarrhea, fecal virus shedding, and intestinal pathological changes, highlighting the pathogenicity of these strains. This study provides evidence that PoRVA can breach the placental barrier and spread to newborn piglets through vertical transmission. These discoveries enhance our understanding of the transmission route of porcine RVA and have the potential to guide the development of efficient vaccine strategies for combating this disease."}

This study aimed to identify the types and prevalence of parasitic diseases among transplant patients at a comprehensive transplant center in Fars Province, southern Iran. The subjects of the study were 150 organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, intestine, simultaneous pancreas and kidney [SPK]) who were at least two months post-transplantation. Stool samples were collected from each participant, and demographics along with clinical features were recorded. The stool samples underwent parasitological examination, including direct examination, zinc sulfate flotation, formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation, trichrome, and acid-fast staining to detect protozoan and helminthic infections. Samples positive for Blastocystis sp., as well as all diarrheal samples suspected of having microsporidia or intestinal coccidia, were further investigated using molecular methods. Sequencing was performed on the PCR products obtained from 10 Blastocystis samples. The resulting sequences were submitted to the Blastocystis 18 S database for GenBank sequence queries. The mean age of the participants was 46.24 (\u00b1 15.13), ranging from 18 to 85 years. Among the 150 subjects, 96 (64%) were male and 54 (36%) were female. The majority had undergone kidney transplantation (52.66%), followed by liver transplantation (46%). The participants resided in various provinces of Iran, with the majority (61.33%) living in Fars province. Overall, 63 (42%) individuals were found to be infected with at least one type of intestinal parasite. Blastocystis sp., the most commonly detected parasite, was detected in 58 (38.66%) cases, Entamoeba coli and Iodamoeba butchlii were each detected in 2 (1.33%) cases, while Enterocytozoon bieneusi was identified in 1 (0.66%) case. No helminth infections were detected in any of the subjects. Sequencing of Blastocystis sp. revealed subtype 3 (ST3). The study highlights a high prevalence of intestinal protozoa, particularly Blastocystis sp., among transplant recipients in southern Iran. The detection of E. bieneusi underscores the critical need for greater awareness of these parasitic agents, especially in cases presenting with diarrhea."}

To explore the clinical and genetic diversity of CTX cases in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, comparing the phenotypic differences between children and adults. The retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study included 16 clinically and genetically confirmed CTX cases. Data collected encompassed clinical presentations, diagnostic delays, biochemical markers such as cholestanol levels, neuroimaging findings, and genetic mutations in the CYP27A1 gene. Participants were categorized into pediatric and adult groups. Common clinical features included cognitive decline (75%), learning difficulties (69%), diarrhea (56%), cataracts (56%), gait issues (50%), and behavioral changes (44%). Notably, childhood diarrhea was strongly associated with earlier diagnosis, with approximately 90% of such cases identified in this age group. Misdiagnosis occurred in 3 patients, with an average diagnostic delay of 6.1 years-shorter for children (2.7 years) compared to adults (11.6 years). Tendon xanthoma was observed in only 1 patient. Genetic testing identified 7 CYP27A1 variants, highlighting genetic heterogeneity in this population. This study emphasizes the need for increased physician awareness, particularly regarding pediatric presentations, to reduce diagnostic delays and prevent irreversible neurological damage.

Many approaches were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments; these approaches included body weight analysis, evaluations of short-term memory, biomarker assessments, histopathological examinations, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results suggest that agomelatine treatment effectively countered the weight loss associated with AD. Importantly, agomelatine enhanced cognitive performance, as indicated by improved short-term memory in spatial recognition assessments; mice treated with agomelatine showed spontaneous alternation percentages comparable to controls, with statistically significant differences observed between AD and control groups (Dunn's post-hoc p = 0.0072). Analyses of biomarkers showed that agomelatine reduced the AD-induced elevation of acetylcholinesterase activity, interleukin-6 levels, and oxidative stress markers while increasing total antioxidant capacity. Histopathological assessments showed enhanced structural integrity in hippocampal regions. FTIR spectroscopy revealed agomelatine's protective effect on brain molecular structure, mainly through preserving lipid order in the CH stretching region and preventing protein oxidation in the C = O spectral range, both of which are typically altered by AD pathology. These results emphasize the efficacy of agomelatine and support its consideration in mitigating symptoms associated with AD etiology."}

However, the mechanism by which MSCs alleviate colitis and how MSCs affect intestinal mucosal barrier is still unclear. LPS-exposed human colonic epithelial cancer cell lines Caco2 and HT29. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mouse were treated with MenSCs. We found that LPS downregulates intercellular junction proteins and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines in intestinal epithelial cells. MenSCs reduced paracellular permeability and restored barrier integrity in Caco2 cells. In Vivo, MenSCs mitigated DSS-induced colitis in mice by reducing body weight loss, colonic shortening, and disease activity index scores and by inhibiting the expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. MenSCs increased the expression of TJ proteins, improved the destruction of tight junction (TJ) structures, and reduced intestinal epithelial permeability. Furthermore, MenSCs could inhibit NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation and the expression of Snail and prevent Snail nuclear localization, thereby maintaining tight and adherens junctions. Our findings demonstrate that MenSCs alleviate intestinal inflammation and enhance barrier function by suppressing the NF-\u03baB/Snail signaling axis, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel diseases."}

However, transhiatal sleeve migration (THSM) after LSG is currently considered an aggravating factor for postoperative weight regain and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thus, our aims in this study were to clarify the incidence of THSM after LSG and to evaluate the relationships between THSM parameters and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of THSM after LSG. We enrolled 107 patients with severe obesity who underwent LSG. We collected their clinical data at baseline and 1 year after LSG. All the patients were routinely examined with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and evaluated for GERD severity using the Los Angeles classification. They underwent a routine computed tomography examination, and the THSM length and volume were measured at a computer workstation. We then comprehensively analyzed the THSM parameters and clinical features of weight loss and GERD. The mean percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) in this cohort was 26.2%. The Los Angeles classification data, determined by EGD evaluation, indicated an increase in the number of patients with grades B and C GERD from 6 to 11 at 1 year after LSG, and THSM occurred in 16 patients (15.0%). Postoperative antacid administration rate also significantly increased (3.7% vs. 21.8%, p < 0.001). The mean THSM length and volume were 23.7 \u00b1 13.1 mm and 9.6 \u00b1 13.1 mL, respectively. THSM length significantly correlated with THSM volume (r = 0.700 and p = 0.002) and negatively correlated with %TWL (r = -0.620 and p = 0.010). In this cohort, the patients with a THSM length > 20 mm did not achieve a high %TWL at 1 year after LSG (27.3% \u00b1 3.8% vs. 21.4% \u00b1 3.9%, p = 0.010), and patients with a longer THSM length had a higher antacid consumption.

Preoperatively and at least 2 years after surgery, we administered the Italian version of the BODY-Q module and the SCAR-Q questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with particular focus on scars. We enrolled 11 males and 57 females aged between 25 and 65 years, with a mean follow-up of 24.4 months. We recorded significantly higher scores postoperatively compared to preoperatively in every BODY-Q and SCAR-Q scale administered (p < 0.001). Despite its scars, brachioplasty in the post-bariatric patient yields high satisfaction due to the possibility of remodeling the arm silhouette hence solving many daily problems caused by excess skin.

This study assessed the influence of basic posture during marching band performance on lumbar-pelvic kinematics. The participants were healthy young adults without musculoskeletal injuries. Gait was measured under three conditions using a three-dimensional movement analysis system: normal gait, gait with a 1.15 kg trumpet, and marching band performance. An analysis of a single right gait cycle was used in this study to compare the spatiotemporal parameters and joint angles between conditions. The mean values of the thoracic posterior tilt angle, thoracolumbar transition, lumbar extension angle, and anterior pelvic tilt angle in forward marching were significantly higher than those in free walking and instrument-grasping gait (p < .05). The change in the thoracic and lumbar rotation angles in forward marching was significantly lower than those in free walking (p < .05). Forward marching may increase lumbar extension, heighten shear forces, and activate the erector spinae muscles. Restricted upper limb swing may hinder the coordination of the erector spinae muscles and impair trunk stability. Increased trunk/pelvic extension and decreased trunk rotation during forward marching may lead to overloading of the erector spinae muscle. Attention to posture during marching may help prevent low back pain."}

It commonly leads to an impairment in muscle strength and activation. The aim of the study was to assess the short-term effects of thigh muscle strength training conducted via telerehabilitation and in-person in patients with self-reported LBP. The telerehabilitation and control groups completed 10 strength training sessions, five times a week. Both groups were evaluated for electromyographic parameters, maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC), and the number of maximum repetitions of knee flexion-extension movements. Telerehabilitation increased the recruitment of the right rectus femoris (p < 0.05). It improved the maximum repetition capacity for the left knee extension (p < 0.01) movement and for the right and left knee flexion(p < 0.05); however, it was able to reduce the MIVC right and left knee flexion (p < 0.05). Telerehabilitation was able to increase the recruitment of the right biceps femoris muscles and maintain the recruitment of the right and left rectus femoris; improve the maximum repetition capacity for left knee extension and of both the right and left knees flexion movement.

{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "back pain", "text": "The transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle plays a crucial role in lumbar spine stability and core strength. Activation of the TrA is commonly achieved through the abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM). Dysfunction in the deep abdominal muscles is often linked to low back pain and instability. The ADIM technique involves drawing the navel inward toward the spine while maintaining a neutral spine position and normal breathing, thereby engaging the TrA. Sphygmomanometer is a valuable tool for measuring muscle activation, tracking changes in pressure, and ensuring core stability and strength during training. This narrative review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A search across PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and MEDLINE included studies (2010-2024) on ADIM training for TrA activation using a sphygmomanometer. RCTs, observational and Systematic review were included. The PEDro scale assessed study quality, and two independent reviewers conducted data extraction and analysis. A total of sixteen studies (n = 833) demonstrated the effectiveness of ADIM training in activating the TrA muscle, with the sphygmomanometer providing high reliability (ICC = 0.995-0.999) in assessing muscle activation. This review emphasizes the importance of proper training techniques, including visual cues, and biofeedback, to ensure optimal engagement of the deep abdominal muscles. ADIM training is a highly effective strategy for activating the TrA muscle and improving core stability. Sphygmomanometer provides a reliable and objective measurement of muscle strength and activation. Therefore, ADIM should be integrated into rehabilitation and training programs aimed at enhancing core function and preventing low back pain."}

Here we developed a novel selective EGFR C797S inhibitor, HS-10375, and report the results of pre-clinical research and the first-in-human phase 1 trial. Ba/F3 cell lines and patient-derived cells expressing mutant EGFR were used to test the selectively inhibitory potency of HS-10375 in vitro, and cell line-derived xenograft animal models were used to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of HS-10375 in vivo. In the phase 1 trial, HS-10375 was administered orally at six dose levels (10-240 mg) daily (QD) in 21-day cycles, following a rule-based, rolling six design. The primary objectives were the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The secondary objectives included PK parameters and anti-tumor activity. HS-10375 showed more potent activity in inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation compared to 1st to 3rd generation EGFR TKIs in C797S triple-mutant cell lines. HS-10375 also exhibited comparable inhibitory activity to 1st- and 2nd- generation EGFR TKIs and superior activity to 3rd-generation EGFR TKIs in C797S double-mutant cell lines. Furthermore, cells harboring EGFR double or triple C797S mutation underwent remarkable apoptosis upon HS-10375 treatment. HS-10375 effectively inhibited tumor growth in C797S triple-mutant mouse models. In the first-in-human trial, 28 patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancers who harbored EGFR mutation and who had experienced treatment failure with EGFR TKI treatment received at least one dose of HS-10375. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 2 patients at 240 mg QD, and MTD was reached at HS-10375 150 mg QD. The most common treatment-related adverse events were vomit (37.0%), loss of appetite (33.3%), and elevated AST (33.3%). One patient with EGFR mutations showed tumor shrinkage after progression on five-line treatment including gefitinib, almonertinib, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and EGFRxHER3 antibody-drug conjugate.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a two-year long humanitarian One Health tungiasis control project in 17 villages in Napak district, Karamoja region, Northeastern Uganda. The community-based intervention included quarterly systematic tungiasis detection and treatment with the dimeticone oil formula in residents and domestic animals in combination with community health promotion. In each of the eight quarterly tungiasis diagnosis and treatment rounds, between 3,674 and 5,155 residents were examined (coverage 73.6-89.9%). Overall, 12,540 tungiasis cases among residents were diagnosed and treated and 16 community dialogue meetings were held. Tungiasis prevalence among residents decreased from 62.8% to 5.7% in the two-year study period. While at baseline tungiasis was most prevalent in children and the elderly, at the end elderly women were the single most affected group. The prevalence of tungiasis-related walking difficulties in the community decreased from 11.5% to 0.5%, and pain and itching were greatly reduced. The number of animals present in the villages was low (between 79 and 414 per treatment round) and the prevalence of tungiasis in animals dropped from 14.2% to 0% throughout the two-year project. This implementation study shows that regular community-based treatment of tungiasis cases among humans and animals with dimeticone oil formula, combined with community engagement and health promotion, can reduce tungiasis prevalence and morbidity to very low levels within two years, even in a hyperendemic area where people live in extreme poverty."}

The final cure rate was 31.0% (232/748). Age, onset-therapy time, initial hearing level, audiogram shape, and vertigo were found to be independently predictive for the prognosis. A scoring system that could incorporate all these five factors based on their prediction weights was then successfully created. The equation of total score was as follows: Total score = 1.2 \u00d7 Age (score) + 1.6 \u00d7 Onset-therapy time (score) + 1.3 \u00d7 Initial hearing level (score) + 2.3 \u00d7 Audiogram shape (score) + 2.8 \u00d7 Vertigo (score). The cure rate of patients with scores of < 5 could reach as high as 81.4%, whereas it was only 10.1% in patients with scores of \u2265 12. This study created a scoring system for predicting the prognosis of unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The cure rates decreased with the increase of score. Patients could be given more individualised treatment according to the preliminary prediction of our system."}

We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model to compare UCIs with hearing aids for adults with severe to profound hearing loss. We developed an average clinical pathway based on data from three Finnish university hospitals to estimate resource use. The model captured health-related quality of life, potential adverse events, device upgrades, and device failure. We estimated unit costs from national expert opinions and from grey and published literature. We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate how uncertain model inputs affect the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER for UCIs compared to hearing aids in the Finnish adult population was \u20ac14,528 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated a 98,5% likelihood that UCIs are cost-effective compared to a \u20ac25,000 per QALY gained threshold. The ICER was most sensitive to the discount rate, UCI device and surgery costs, the utility increment from UCI treatment, costs associated with UCI fitting, and the cost and upgrade cycle of sound processors. UCIs for adults are cost-effective within the Finnish healthcare setting. Our results align with ICER findings for UCIs in the UK and Swedish adult populations, despite differences in indications, clinical pathways, and device unit costs. All studies suggest that UCIs are more cost-effective when implemented at an earlier age, given the same level of hearing performance."}

This condition impacts various aspects of life, including dental health. Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of dental caries among individuals with hearing impairments. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hearing impairment and access to dental care.Methods This cross-sectional study used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. Descriptive analysis, chi-square tests and logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between hearing conditions and dental health, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex and race/ethnicity.Results A sample size of 14,801 was used. Significant associations were observed between hearing conditions and dental health-related variables. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals with mild to severe hearing difficulty were significantly less likely to have visited a dentist in the past year (OR: 1.28; p <0.001).Conclusions Individuals with mild to severe hearing difficulty are significantly less likely to visit a dentist. The findings of this study highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve access to dental care in individuals with hearing impairment."}

This approach has yet to be explored in the context of tinnitus. We obtained cis-eQTL data for 3,453 druggable genes from eQTLGen. Tinnitus phenotype derived from the UK Biobank was used as the discovery cohort. A large-scale Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate the inferred causal relationships between the 3,453 druggable genes and tinnitus. Replication analyses were conducted using tinnitus phenotypes from FinnGen. We further conducted colocalization analysis to identify actionable drug targets for tinnitus. Besides, MR analysis was used to explore the association of the identified genes with hearing loss and inflammation. Genetic predictions indicated that the expression of NEU1 (\u03b2 = 0.137, 95% CI = 0.112 to 0.162, p = 2.21 \u00d7 10-26), APOM (\u03b2 = 0.139, 95% CI = 0.112 to 0.166, p = 1.23 \u00d7 10-24), and TUBB (\u03b2 = -0.043, 95% CI = -0.062 to -0.024, p = 5.46 \u00d7 10-6) was causally associated with tinnitus. Our replication analysis in FinnGen yielded consistent results. There is a strong colocalization association between the three genes and tinnitus (PPH4 > 0.8). No evidence indicated these three genes were associated with hearing loss. Network MR suggested that IL-17C and CCL20 mediates effects of APOM on tinnitus, and IL-17C accounts for effects of NEU1 on tinnitus. Our findings investigated the potential pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets of tinnitus, providing novel strategies for future clinical trials."}

Recent research suggests that acoustic background noise can enhance neural speech tracking, enabling the auditory system to robustly encode speech even under unfavorable conditions. Aging and hearing loss are associated with internal, neural noise in the auditory system, raising the question whether additional acoustic background noise enhances neural speech tracking in older adults. In the current electroencephalography study, younger (\u223c25.5 years) and older adults (\u223c68.5 years) listened to spoken stories in quiet (clear) or in the presence of background noise at a wide range of different signal-to-noise ratios. In younger adults, early neural speech tracking responses (<0.15 s) were enhanced by minimal background noise, indicating response facilitation through noise. In contrast, older adults, compared to younger adults, showed enhanced neural speech tracking for clear speech and speech masked by minimal background noise, but the acoustic noise led to little enhancement of the early neural tracking response in older people. The data demonstrate different sensitivity of the auditory cortex to speech masked by noise between younger and older adults. The results are consistent with the idea that the auditory cortex of older people exhibits more internal, neural noise that enhances neural speech tracking but that additional acoustic noise does not further support speech encoding. The work points to a highly non-linear auditory system that differs between younger and older adults."}

We sought to identify shared and distinct functional connectivity (FC) features across SSNHL and tinnitus patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore how virus influences brain network remodeling in SSNHL and tinnitus. We recruited 31 SSNHL patients with tinnitus following SARS-CoV-2 infection (COV-SSNHL), 32 non-viral SSNHL patients with tinnitus, and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Brain functional connectivity coefficients were used to construct graph data analyzed with a graph attention network (GAT) model for categorization. Analyses focused on the auditory network (AN), salience network (SN), and default mode network (DMN) and their correlations with tinnitus severity. Both SSNHL groups showed reduced connectivity within the SN and DMN, which correlated with tinnitus severity. Notably, COV-SSNHL patients exhibited distinct, complex network remodeling involving the AN, SN, and DMN, with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as a central mediator. This remodeling facilitated interactions within the SN and across networks, marking COV-SSNHL as neurologically unique. This study highlights the distinct neural alterations in brain networks in COV-SSNHL patients, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of viral-induced SSNHL and tinnitus. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets and contribute to understanding the central mechanisms underlying these conditions."}
{"entity_type": "symptom", "query": "hearing loss", "text": "There is growing evidence that many perceptual difficulties associated with age-related hearing loss are not solely due to cochlear damage and are exacerbated by changes within the central nervous system. We examined electrophysiological (EEG) responses to clicks and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in 49 older (29 female) and 26 younger (20 female) adults to determine the extent to which auditory nerve (AN) deficits in older adults contributed to functional and structural changes throughout the auditory system. Older adults exhibited smaller AN responses, similar brainstem responses, and larger auditory cortex (AC) responses, demonstrating progressive \"central gain\". Audiometric thresholds were not predictive of EEG measures. Reduced AN function predicted deficits in cortical microstructure (lower AC fractional anisotropy, FA) in older adults, consistent with myelin degeneration. These lower FA values in the AC of older adults also predicted larger AC responses and more central gain. Older adults exhibited significantly lower AC FA and higher mean diffusivity (MD) than younger adults, and AC FA and MD were significant predictors of speech-in-noise (SIN) recognition in older adults. The results suggest that reduced afferent input in older adults not only results in functional changes throughout the auditory system consistent with progressive gain, but also contributes to deficits in AC structure beyond those explained by age alone, contributing to SIN deficits. Understanding the complex effects of age, reduced AN input, central gain, and AC structure on SIN recognition may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention. Age-related hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit with aging, but little is known about how the auditory cortex adapts to the chronic loss of afferent auditory input. We measured auditory nerve, brainstem, and cortical responses in younger and older adults. In older adults, deficits in afferent input predicted progressive hyperexcitability, or \"central gain\", at the brainstem and cortex. Smaller auditory nerve responses predicted poorer white matter structure in auditory cortex. Poorer white matter structure predicted smaller auditory cortex responses, more auditory cortical gain, and worse speech-in-noise recognition in older adults. This is the first study to show that reduced afferent input leads to both amplified cortical responses and reduced cortical integrity in older adults, contributing to speech-in-noise deficits."}

The computed Q-test of homogeneity was 5870.97 and the pooled mean age of identification was 30 months (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 19.3-41.3). These findings show that congenital or early-onset HL in SA is identified later than the national and international standards, that is, < 1 month of age. These findings are important for future research, priority setting and implementation of strategies to reduce the burden and impact of HL. Future research investigating the barriers to early detection of HL in SA is recommended.

Thus, we explored the developmental trajectory of early-auditory ability of children with SASHL who wear HAs, and compared the differences in different types of SASHL (the mild-moderate, moderate-severe, and severe-profound). We performed a prospective, longitudinal study of 31 children with SASHL who were followed for 18 months.

A spline function was implemented to describe the observed EPLAD trajectory. A cubic polynomial regression model was used to predict the change in the ITMAIS score over time, and nonparametric tests or the chi-squared test was used to compare differences between groups. ITMAIS scores were statistically-significantly different between all subsequent follow-ups ( The EPLAD trajectory of the SASHL children was steepest during the first month after HA fitting and leveled-off gradually thereafter. The more severe the degree of hearing loss, the slower the EPLAD rate, which emphasizes the importance of early intervention.

To explore the phenomenological dimension of physical craving in addiction, we measured self-reported body sensations of craving among individuals with subclinical (binge drinking, BD) or clinical (severe alcohol use disorder, SAUD) alcohol use disorders. We used a body mapping technique, allowing for the free report of the bodily counterparts of psychological phenomena, among 76 binge drinkers and 97 recently detoxified patients with SAUD. We measured the taxonomy, localization, intensity, and pleasantness of the craving bodily sensations. Physical sensations of craving were reported (1) for individuals with BD habits, mostly in the shoulders/thorax (53.95%), mouth (47.37%), and forehead (31.58%), in the form of palpitations, dryness, and tension; (2) for patients with SAUD, most often and with the highest average intensity in the hands (31.96%), forehead (24.74%), and shoulders/thorax (22.68%), in the form of tremors, perspiration, and palpitations. In BD, craving sensations were described as slightly unpleasant to pleasant. Conversely, in SAUD patients, craving was perceived as slightly to very unpleasant. These findings bring forth a novel perspective of the bodily mechanisms involved in craving. They support a dissociation between subclinical and clinical populations of excessive alcohol drinkers, as body sensations related to craving might generate alcohol consumption through positive reinforcement (to extend positive sensations) for subclinical populations and through negative reinforcement (to alleviate unpleasant body sensations) for clinical populations. More widely, we highlight the need to add perceived bodily sensations to the predominantly and exclusively cognitive focus that characterizes the craving research field, since craving is also underpinned by physical sensations."}

Excess ammonia is highly toxic to the brain and can cause neurological dysfunctions, such as tremors, ataxia, seizures, coma, and even death. Hyperammonemia is often the primary manifestation of urea cycle disorders (UCDs), a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by impaired nitrogen detoxification due to dysfunctions in urea cycle-related enzymes and transporters. Patients with complete deficiencies of urea cycle enzymes typically present with lethargy, hypothermia, anorexia, seizures, abnormal respiratory patterns (hyperventilation or hypoventilation), neurologic posturing, and coma, along with hyperammonemia within a few days after birth. This condition, classified as the neonatal-onset type, frequently results in severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy (\u2265600 \u03bcg/dL [360 \u03bcmol/L]) at onset. Hyperammonemia with blood ammonia levels of 600 \u03bcg/dL (360 \u03bcmol/L) or higher causes significant brain damage. Therefore, at this threshold, hemodialysis is indicated to rapidly remove ammonia and mitigate its harmful effects on the brain. However, even when neonatal-onset UCD patients undergo a combination of hemodialysis and liver transplantation at the onset of severe hyperammonemia (\u2265600 \u03bcg/dL [360 \u03bcmol/L]), the neuroprotective effects remain limited.

Despite its proven utility in larger animals, MBMC has remained underutilized in mice due to the difficulty of robust marker attachment during unrestricted behavior. In response to this challenge, markerless tracking methods, facilitated by machine learning, have become the standard in small animal studies due to their simpler experimental setup. However, trajectories obtained with markerless approaches at best approximate ground-truth kinematics, with accuracy strongly dependent on video resolution, training dataset quality, and computational resources for data processing.Here, we overcome the primary limitation of MBMC in mice by implanting minimally invasive markers that remain securely attached over weeks of recordings. This technique produces high-resolution, artifact-free trajectories, eliminating the need for extensive post-processing. We demonstrate the advantages of MBMC by resolving subtle drug-induced kinematic changes that become apparent only within specific behavioral contexts, necessitating precise three-dimensional tracking beyond simple flat-surface locomotion. Furthermore, MBMC uniquely captures the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of harmaline-induced tremors, revealing previously inaccessible correlations between body parts and thus significantly improving the translational value of preclinical tremor models. While markerless tracking remains optimal for many behavioral neuroscience studies in which general posture estimation suffices, MBMC removes barriers to investigations demanding greater precision, reliability, and low-noise trajectories.

Despite possessing average or even above-average intellectual abilities, he was considered unfit for public office (cursus honorum) due to these physical conditions. Based on remaining historical records, modern scholars have proposed several possible diagnoses, including cerebral palsy, dystonia, transverse myelitis, or Tourette syndrome. While earlier scholarship argued that he had cerebral palsy, more recent interpretations favor dystonia or Tourette syndrome. This claim is supported by historical records that show how Claudius' symptoms fluctuated over time since his childhood and how he was able to maintain a relatively stable health during his reign, carrying out his imperial duties effectively. Claudius's physical impairments subjected him to harsh treatment from his family. His mother Antonia the Younger, his sister Livilla, and his paternal grandmother Livia treated him with contempt. In contrast, his adoptive grandfather Augustus showed some leniency, expressing hope that Claudius' condition might improve one day. None the less, both Augustus and his uncle Tiberius chose to excluded him from public service. His disabilities, especially his walking and speech issues, remained a source of ridicule even after his death. This is poignantly illustrated in Seneca's satirical poem \"Apocolocyntosis,\" which was written after his death. Unable to become a celebrated soldier or orator due to his physical limitations, Claudius was far removed from the Roman ideal of leadership both in his own times and in posterior times. He was often met with contempt and discrimination. Nevertheless, he proved to be a capable and successful emperor. Although none of his contemporary historians explicitly recorded the efforts Claudius may have made to overcome his disabilities, such perseverance can be inferred from the subtext of historical accounts.

We present a case of a 26-year-old female known to have SVT, who presented with six hours of palpitations, with a past medical history of successful cryoablation performed in 2021 for atrial tachycardia originating from tissue near the atrioventricular bundle. Her maintenance therapy included bisoprolol 2.5 mg. Notably, the patient reported regular and excessive consumption of energy drinks, averaging multiple servings daily. The pharmacological intervention failed to achieve rhythm control, necessitating DCCV. Despite appropriate sedation and energy dosing, initial cardioversion attempts were unsuccessful. Subsequent higher-energy shocks ultimately restored sinus rhythm. This case underscores an unusual presentation of cardioversion-resistant SVT in a young adult with prior ablation. The patient's habitual intake of energy drinks raises concern for potential pro-arrhythmic and electrophysiologic alterations induced by high caffeine and other stimulant content. While caffeine's arrhythmogenic potential is recognized, its role in altering myocardial excitability and threshold for cardioversion is not well established. This case adds to the limited literature suggesting that excessive stimulant use may contribute to treatment-resistant arrhythmic episodes. Clinicians should be aware of dietary and lifestyle factors, such as energy drink consumption, which may influence the efficacy of electrical cardioversion. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which stimulants impact cardioversion outcomes in patients with SVT."}

Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is often limited in these cases due to valve rigidity, increasing the risk of mitral regurgitation (MR). Transcatheter mitral valve lithotripsy (TMVL) is an emerging technique that uses sonic waves to disrupt calcification, enhancing valve pliability and PBMV outcomes. A 39-year-old woman, 18 weeks pregnant, with a history of rheumatic heart disease and prior surgical mitral commissurotomy, presented with palpitations, fatigue, and exertional breathlessness. She had severe MS (mitral valve area 0.8 cm\u00b2) and severe tricuspid regurgitation, with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response. Due to a high Wilkins score, PBMV was attempted with a 28 mm Inoue balloon inflated to 28 mm, but was suboptimal due to significant valve rigidity. Adjunctive TMVL improved valve pliability, successfully reducing the mitral gradient and increasing valve area without worsening MR. The patient continued her pregnancy without complications. This case highlights TMVL as a promising adjunct to PBMV in severe calcified MS, particularly in high-risk patients such as pregnant women. Further studies are needed to validate its efficacy and long-term outcomes."}

This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence, severity, and changes in patient-reported symptoms between the prehospital period and the emergency department and determine whether symptoms predicted an acute coronary syndrome diagnosis and/or adverse patient outcomes (eg, death). Individuals who were \u226521 years old and transported by emergency medical services with nontraumatic chest pain or anginal equivalent symptoms were eligible. Patients completed the Acute Coronary Syndrome Symptom Checklist in the ambulance and on arrival to the emergency department. Chi-square, t tests, and logistic regression were used, adjusting for age, sex, and race, to estimate associations between symptoms and acute coronary syndrome diagnoses and adverse events within 30 days. The sample included 206 individuals. Chest pain was the chief complaint at T1 and T2. Participants reporting chest pressure, shoulder pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, and chest pain were significantly younger than participants without these symptoms. Sweating at T1 was associated with increased odds of an acute coronary syndrome diagnosis (odds ratio, 3.24, P = .01). At T2, chest discomfort and unusual fatigue were predictive of acute coronary syndrome diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.59 and 2.98; P < .045 and P < .03, respectively). Patients experiencing shortness of breath at either T1 or T2 had significantly increased odds of adverse events (odds ratio, 3.96 and 3.26, respectively; P = .02 and P = .04). Six symptoms decreased by ED arrival. Chest symptoms, sweating, fatigue, and shortness of breath should trigger concern for acute coronary syndrome in clinicians. Results indicate the importance of calling emergency medical service, which was associated with a prehospital reduction in symptoms."}

Due to the absence of specific clinical symptoms, its diagnosis is often challenging. Here, we present a case of cardiac amyloidosis secondary to multiple myeloma, incidentally complicated by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Although the breast cancer was diagnosed as stage 0 (DCIS), the patient's heart failure symptoms worsened following surgical resection. As a result, further evaluation by the cardiology department was performed, leading to a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Subsequently, a hematology consultation was obtained, and bone marrow biopsy revealed that clonal plasma cells accounted for more than 60% of bone marrow cellularity, confirming a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient received daratumumab + bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone therapy, achieved a partial response, and has been alive for >2 years. This case is a valuable example of a patient who experienced a gradual onset of the symptoms of amyloidosis, including palpitations, pleural effusion, right and left heart failure, before a diagnosis could be made. It took a total of eight departments to make a diagnosis, as it was challenging. Even if no abnormalities are observed in a single examination, it is important to listen carefully to patient complaints, repeat the examination if necessary, and work with multiple departments to provide treatment."}

An automatic referral for electrophysiology (EP) consult was generated in patients with moderate-severe COPD if they endorsed one of the following: palpitations, dizziness, syncope, or near syncope. Eligible patients underwent ILR implantation after evaluation with an EP specialist and were followed via remote monitoring for 12 months. A control group of patients without COPD matched for age, sex, and implant indication were randomly selected in a 3:1 ratio. Actionable arrhythmias, defined as arrhythmias that correlated with symptoms triggered by the patient, necessitating EP intervention, were recorded for both groups. In this prospective cohort study, 21 patients with COPD were enrolled and compared to 63 controls implanted during the same period. COPD patients experienced a significantly higher rate of actionable arrhythmias compared to the controls (48% vs 11%, p<0.001). EP interventions in response to actionable arrhythmias included eight patients initiated on anticoagulation, three catheter ablations, one implantable cardiac defibrillator, and one permanent pacemaker implanted. In multivariate analysis, COPD was an independent predictor of actionable arrhythmias (aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2-15.2, p=0.02) when adjusting for chronic kidney disease and all-cause readmissions. Continuous monitoring was highly effective in diagnosing significant arrhythmic events in patients with moderate-severe COPD.

Catheter-induced mechanical trauma of the AP is not infrequent during electrophysiology study and can lead to procedure discontinuation. We present an alternative method to successfully ablate a persistently traumatized AP. A 15-year-old patient was referred for ablation of a symptomatic parahisian AP. Unfortunately, the AP was mechanically traumatized during catheter placement, and conduction did not resume after a 45-min waiting period. We proceeded to determine the ventricular insertion of the AP. Pace mapping was performed at the ventricular aspect of the tricuspid annulus with bipolar pacing from the ablation catheter. Using electroanatomic mapping, a correlation map between the maximally pre-excited QRS morphology (recorded at the beginning of the electrophysiological study) and the pace-mapped QRS was displayed. The highest correlation was 94%. The area delimited by the 3 best pace-map matching points was considered the target area, and radiofrequency applications were delivered. No recurrence of pre-excitation or palpitations were observed during 6 months of follow-up. Determining the distal ventricular insertion of a mechanically traumatized AP is feasible, by comparing a maximally pre-excited QRS with the paced-mapped QRS. Electroanatomic correlation mapping may help delineate a limited target area before ablation."}

The aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these devices in differentiating atrial fibrillation (AF) from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an irregular rhythm alert. This retrospective, single-center observational study was conducted in the ED of a tertiary hospital over a two-year period. The study included adult patients (\u226522 years) who presented to the ED following an irregular rhythm alert generated by their smartwatch. Smartwatches were classified as either ECG-capable devices or PPG-based devices. Final rhythm diagnoses were confirmed by two independent emergency physicians based on 12\u2011lead ECG findings obtained during the ED evaluation. A total of 424 patients were included. Of these, 63.7 % (n = 270) used ECG-capable smartwatches, and 66.3 % (n = 281) received an AF alert. Among all alerts, 60.8 % (n = 258) were ECG-based and 39.2 % (n = 166) were PPG-based. Common presenting symptoms included palpitations (56.1 %), dizziness (21.7 %), and dyspnea (23.6 %), while 8.5 % of patients were asymptomatic. In total, 44.6 % (n = 189) required pharmacologic or electrical interventions. Smartwatches demonstrated moderate accuracy for AF and SVT detection. PPG-based detection showed higher sensitivity than ECG-based detection (AF: 54.3 % vs. 44.9 %; SVT: 83.6 % vs. 79.2 %). Agreement with final ECG diagnoses was poor (Cohen's Kappa = 0), with significant misclassification for both arrhythmias (McNemar's p < 0.001), except for PPG-based SVT (p = 0.072). No significant predictors of false-positive AF alerts were found (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.538).

Prevalence data were extracted or estimated to inform the epidemiological burden of UI in the EU. The economic burden of UI in 27 EU member states was then estimated, which included direct and indirect productivity losses and incontinence pad disposal costs. The 2023 results were presented, and projections for 2030 were estimated for future costs if no preventative action is taken. All costs were expressed in euros (EUR\u20ac). In 2023, the EU economic burden of UI was EUR\u20ac69.1 billion (EUR\u20ac26.1-133.4 billion) without caregiver costs, with females bearing quadruple the burden compared with males. On average, per-patient annual costs were EUR\u20ac1,470.6. Caregiver costs increased EU economic burden to EUR\u20ac80.0 billion (EUR\u20ac32.5-150.6 billion) with per-patient per-year costs increasing to EUR\u20ac1,700.0. In 2030, the economic burden could rise to EUR\u20ac100.2 billion (EUR\u20ac40.8-188.6 billion). Shifting to 100% incontinence pad waste recycling could reduce the overall carbon footprint of continence health in Europe by 117.8 million kg CO2e in 2023. A high UI economic burden emphasises the economic and environmental benefits of prevention. The results highlight the need for recognising the high economic burden in women, improved prevalence data surveillance driving effective prevention strategies, and formally recognising secondary caregivers in the UI treatment pathway."}

This study investigated the proportion of physiotherapy care, differentiated by age, sex, care situation, informal provider networks, and temporal trends, to address these evidence gaps. We analysed health insurance fund claims data covering a period of 9 years (2008-2016), from up to 6,433,070 individuals aged 65+, and applied a network approach to identify patient sharing networks. We calculated the proportion of physiotherapy care on a quarterly basis. The proportion of physiotherapy care remained relatively stable over time.

This study incorporated studies published from Jan 2007 through May 2024, encompassing our complete literature search and selection timeline. Following the inclusion criteria for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we performed a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the vaginal SIMS and SMUS. All published RCTs involving women with SUI receiving SIMS or SMUS were eligible for inclusion, with no exclusion criteria based on language, type of SIMS/SMUS devices, or publication status. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3, with primary outcomes being patient-reported and objective cure rates. Secondary outcomes included operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative day one pain scores, quality of life assessments, and certain safety-related surgical indicators.

A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science, was performed in October 2024. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and their data were extracted and analyzed using RevMan 5.4 software. The primary outcome was the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) negative subscale. Eight RCTs involving 533 patients were included in the study. Ondansetron showed a statistically significant improvement in PANSS negative subscale at 12 weeks [pooled as mean difference, MD = -2.96, 95 % CI [-4.69, -1.24], P-value = 0.00007] and in general psychopathology scale [MD = -2.71, 95 % CI [-3.52, -1.90] compared to placebo. However, ondansetron and placebo did not differ in reduction of PANSS positive subscale [MD = 0.1, 95 % CI [-1.19, 1.38], P-value = 0.88], and depression scale. Ondansetron showed no significant difference regarding tardive dyskinesia between the two groups. However, constipation was significant in the ondansetron group over placebo. The study findings provide valuable insights into the efficacy of ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, in managing schizophrenia, particularly negative symptoms. However, the limitations of the study highlight the need for caution in interpreting these results. Further high-quality trials are required to confirm our findings and explore the long-term impact of ondansetron in the treatment of schizophrenia."}

Due to limited pediatric data, reference ranges and management are often extrapolated from adult studies. We review four pediatric neurogastroenterology areas where clinical science may translate and inform adult gastroenterology. Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency can be diagnosed via disaccharidase enzyme testing from duodenal mucosal biopsies. Dietary restriction and sacrosidase supplementation are effective, based on randomized controlled trials, in children with genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency; however, they remain to be rigorously studied in adults. Gastric emptying breath testing (GEBT) in large cohorts of children reinforces the importance of biological sex, puberty, and size while deriving normative reference values. Further study of GEBT in adults may help determine the influence of sex and hormones on gastric emptying rates, offering an opportunity to develop tailored reference ranges. Antegrade continence enema (ACE) therapy is the most common reversible surgical treatment for children with chronic constipation with high rates of efficacy. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of ACE in adult populations. Auricular neurostimulation through percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia based on sham-controlled, randomized trials with emerging efficacy data in other pediatric DGBI. To date, efficacy studies using auricular neurostimulation in adults with gastrointestinal disorders have not been performed. These areas highlight how pediatric neurogastroenterology generates discoveries with the potential to guide approaches in adult populations, underscoring the bidirectional value of translational clinical science."}

Among these, paraduodenal hernias represent a significant subtype and require prompt recognition and intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no significant medical or surgical history who presented with a three-day history of generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Clinical examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory findings were unremarkable except for leukocytosis. Abdominal X-ray demonstrated features of small bowel obstruction, and CT imaging identified findings suggestive of a left paraduodenal hernia. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a large encapsulated peritoneal sac originating from the left paraduodenal region and extending into the pelvis. Dilated and edematous but viable small bowel loops were released, and adhesiolysis was performed. A planned second-look surgery two days later confirmed resolution of bowel edema, and the abdomen was closed without complications. Paraduodenal hernias arise from a congenital anomaly involving the mesentery and often present as intermittent or acute bowel obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms but can be facilitated by CT imaging. Definitive management involves surgical reduction and repair of the hernia, whether through open or laparoscopic approaches. This case highlights the importance of considering internal hernias in young patients with small bowel obstruction and no prior abdominal surgery. Prompt imaging, timely surgery, and individualized management are crucial for optimal outcomes."}

Poor sleep is a key indicator of symptom stability. Constipation is also more common in this population. While emerging evidence suggests that gut-brain interactions play a role in affective disorders, the relationship between constipation severity and sleep disturbances remains underexplored. This study examined the mediating effect of constipation severity on the relationship between affective symptoms and sleep quality in people with schizophrenia. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 256 participants with schizophrenia across two psychiatric hospitals. Structured questionnaires were used to assess affective symptoms, constipation severity, and sleep quality. We analyzed the mediating role of constipation severity while controlling for seven covariates by conducting multiple regression analysis using the SPSS PROCESS macro model 4. Anxiety, depressive symptoms, constipation severity, and sleep quality were found to be interconnected. The findings showed that neither anxiety nor depressive symptoms significantly impacted sleep quality when accounting for constipation severity, indicating that constipation fully mediated the relationship between affective symptoms and sleep quality. In individuals with schizophrenia, constipation has a greater negative impact on sleep quality than affective symptoms. This study highlights the need to address constipation in mental health care, as managing it may improve both sleep and emotional well-being. A holistic approach that includes constipation management should be part of treatment plans for those facing mental health and sleep issues."}

In this study, we aimed to identify gene networks associated with SjD through the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data. We further compared the genetic factors of SjD with other immune-mediated diseases. We analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, DNA methylation, and transcriptomic data using our in-house network-based methods, dmGWAS and EW_dmGWAS, to identify key gene modules associated with SjD. In dmGWAS analysis, discovery and evaluation datasets were used to identify consensus results. We conducted gene-set, cell-type, and disease-enrichment analyses on significant gene modules and explored potential drug targets. Genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization were applied to assess SjD's link with 17 other AIDs and 16 cancer types. dmGWAS identified 207 and 211 gene modules in the discovery and evaluation phases, respectively, while EW_dmGWAS detected 886 modules. Key modules highlighted 55 genes (discovery), 52 genes (evaluation), and 59 genes (EW_dmGWAS), with at least 50 genes from each analysis linked to AIDs and cancer.

While the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain to be precisely elucidated, menopause-related autonomic (dys)function likely plays a key role in CVD development in postmenopausal females. Sympathetic activity is known to increase with age and may rise more steeply in older females, resulting in autonomic imbalance and chronic disease. The menopausal loss of estradiol, a major female sex hormone, contributes to changes in autonomic and vascular physiology and is implicated in prominent menopause symptoms such as sleep difficulty and vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes/night sweats). Estrogen replacement can mitigate some of these negative health effects, but hormone therapy may not be able to reverse all menopause-linked autonomic dysfunction. Thus, this review explores the vast and complex web connecting menopause physiology and symptomatology, including how sex-hormone loss and menopause symptoms may impact autonomic function- in particular, through altered sympathetic regulation of blood pressure and impaired vagal tone- as a gateway to adverse cardiovascular health and greater CVD risk."}

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) often contains low doses of estrogens with or without progesterone and is commonly prescribed to minimize menopausal symptoms. MHT is believed to protect the brain and reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease; however, the evidence supporting this claim is conflicting. Furthermore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the risks and benefits of MHT on brain health. It remains unclear whether other factors, including a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the age at which MHT begins, the formulation, and the route of administration (e.g., pills or a transdermal patch), affect the impact of MHT on the brain. Addressing these questions is crucial to inform clinical decision-making regarding the prescription of MHT and to subsequently enhance women\u2019s brain health during and beyond the menopause transition. Barth et al. analyzed brain imaging data as well as data about lifestyle and demographic factors and histories of gynecological surgeries, of over 20,000 current, past, and never users of MHT from the UK Biobank cohort. As a proxy for brain health, they calculated the so-called \u2018brain age gap\u2019, which refers to the difference between a person\u2019s actual chronological age and their estimated brain age calculated from brain imaging data using machine learning; e.g., if someone\u2019s chronological age is 50 years and their predicted brain age is 45, the brain age gap is \u20135 years. A negative brain age gap indicates a 'younger-looking' brain, while a positive brain age gap suggests a brain that appears 'older'. Barth et al. further looked at the volume of the hippocampus, a brain region important for memory, learning and emotion regulation. They found that women who were current MHT users had an \u2018older looking brain\u2019 than women who had never taken MHT. The volume of the hippocampus was also smaller. In past users, the age at which MHT was last taken also made a difference. Those who were older at the time of their last use after menopause had an \u201colder looking\u201d brain and lower hippocampal volumes. Similar results were found for women who took MHT for longer. However, women on MHT who had undergone surgery to remove their womb and/or both ovaries had a \u2018younger looking brain\u2019 than women on MHT without similar surgical histories. Interestingly, factors such as a genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, differences in formulations, or methods of administration did not appear to affect brain health in this study. The findings of Barth et al. suggest that MHT does not have a general neuroprotective effect, nor does it lead to severe adverse effects on brain health. Instead, the impact of MHT on the brain may be influenced by various factors, including age, duration of use, and past surgical history. However, since the study is cross-sectional, meaning it was conducted at a single point in time, direct causality cannot be established. Future research examining the long-term impact of MHT on brain health is crucial for understanding individual risk profiles and benefits. Women around the world are faced with critical decisions regarding MHT use, yet the current lack of comprehensive research leaves them without the necessary evidence to make informed choices."}

In the presence of constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), no evidence of malignancy and/or opportunistic infection was found. Abdominal ultrasound revealed small amounts of ascites without evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as well as underlying steatohepatitis with hypoproteinemia and right heart failure. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated. Fulminant peritonitis developed, which did not respond to broad anti-infective therapy. Furthermore, progressive respiratory failure developed. An immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was considered as a possibility and, finally, peritoneal as well as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were diagnosed. SUMMARY: In case of unexplained inflammatory response following the initiation of ART, IRIS due to tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and treated at an early stage. Before initiating ART, opportunistic infections, in particular TB if clinically suspected, must be ruled out by biopsy if necessary.

Bei vorliegender B-Symptomatik (Fieber, Nachtschwei\u00df und Gewichtsverlust) ergaben sich zun\u00e4chst keine Hinweise auf ein Malignom und/oder eine opportunistische Infektion. Sonografisch zeigten sich initial wenig Aszites ohne Nachweis einer spontan bakteriellen Peritonitis (SBP) bei zugrunde liegender Fettleberhepatitis mit Hypoprotein\u00e4mie und Rechtsherzdekompensation. Wir veranlassten die Einleitung einer antiretroviralen Therapie (ART). Es kam zu einem komplikativen Verlauf mit Entstehung einer fulminanten Peritonitis, die nicht auf eine breite antiinfektive Therapie ansprach. Im Weiteren zeigte sich eine respiratorische Verschlechterung mit progredienter Oxygenierungsst\u00f6rung.

The disease is characterized by focal and indurated cervical lymphadenopathy with fever and other infrequent systemic manifestations, including neurologic symptoms that are rare. This report details the diagnosis and treatment of a 14-year-old male with an atypical case of KFD. He exhibited a fever that persisted for over 1 month together with dizziness, nausea, arthralgia, night sweats, weight loss, and splenomegaly. On day 16 following fever onset, he presented with symptoms of aseptic meningitis, with symptoms of cervical lymph node swelling and pain only manifesting on day 25 after fever onset. Positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) revealed the enlargement of lymph nodes in several regions of the body.

Traditional treatments primarily focus on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), which aim to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which modulate serotonin levels. However, these treatments often provide only modest symptom relief. This review explores the potential benefits of combined targeting of cholinesterases and serotonin reuptake as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. We discuss the pathophysiological role of acetylcholine and serotonin in AD, highlighting their impact on cognitive function, mood regulation, and neuroplasticity. By targeting both cholinergic and serotonergic systems, this dual approach may offer synergistic effects, improving cognitive function, reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms, and enhancing neuroprotective mechanisms. The review also examines preclinical and clinical studies investigating the efficacy of combination therapies and outlines the challenges and opportunities in their development. Ultimately, this combined targeting approach holds promise for providing more effective and comprehensive treatment options for AD, addressing both cognitive and behavioural symptoms associated with the disease."}

Cognitive deficits, which include memory and spatial learning deficits caused by A\u03b2, were evaluated using a set of behavioural tests. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Western blot analysis were used to characterize the exosomes from the brain and the serum. The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in exosomes was also evaluated, and the proteomic analysis of the serum-derived exosomes was conducted through LC-MS Triple ToF and bioinformatics to identify the altered pathways associated with identified proteins. The results obtained showed that there were significant alterations in the exosomal proteome profile after A\u03b2 treatment. The levels of some of the proteins that are involved in energy metabolism, amyloid clearance, cytoskeleton, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation were particularly affected. Treatment with the phytochemical FA modulated the exosomal proteome profile alterations and the activity of AChE in exosomes, which are some of the hallmarks of cholinergic dysfunction in the case of AD. However, the analysis of the proteome of the AD condition revealed that there were distinct alterations in the content of serum-derived exosomes, which could be used as candidates for non-invasive biomarkers of AD progression.

A total of 221 patients with mCRPC and 159 caregivers from USA, France, Germany, Canada, Spain, China, and Brazil were surveyed. mCRPC impacts mood, emotional and mental health (50-77%), sleep (48-68%), career goals (48-80%), and social activities (46-65%). Primary symptoms/side effects are urination issues (trouble urinating: 33-60%; painful/burning urination: 32-50%, frequent urination: 27-50%) and sexual dysfunction (lower libido: 10-57%), which impact romantic relationships. Caregivers often spouses or partners, provide practical, financial, and emotional support, averaging 11 hours/week of providing care. Patients face high treatment and pill burden (7-12 pills/day) and prefer simpler treatment regimens. Hope motivates patients and genetic testing is one such avenue of hope. mCRPC is a life-changing diagnosis with physical, psychological, and financial burdens. By encouraging early genetic testing and fostering patient-centered conversation, HCPs can provide personalized care for optimized treatment outcomes in mCRPC. This study assessed the experiences of people living with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) \u2013 a type of advanced prostate cancer that may not respond to certain treatments \u2013 and the caregivers who support such individuals. Researchers surveyed patients and caregivers in seven countries to better understand how mCRPC affects daily life and how they feel about treatments and genetic testing. The results showed that mCRPC has a major impact on many areas of life, including mood, mental health, sleep, career goals, and social activities. Common symptoms include problems with urination and trouble with sex, which also affect romantic relationships. Most caregivers were spouses or partners who provided both emotional and financial support, spending an average of 11 hours each week helping their loved ones. Patients take many pills daily and generally prefer simpler treatment routines. Despite the challenges, many patients remain hopeful, and some see genetic testing as a promising option for more personalized treatment. In conclusion, mCRPC affects physical health, mental well-being and finances of both patients and caregivers.

The secondary aims were to characterize patients in both ICUs; identify factors associated with the occurrence of ADRs; assess the performance of triggers in detecting ADRs; describe ADRs in terms of severity, mechanism, causality, and suspected drugs; and compare the trigger tool methodology with spontaneous reporting. This was a descriptive and retrospective study involving the application of triggers adapted from the Global Trigger Tool to identify ADRs through the analysis of physical and electronic medical records, medical prescriptions, and laboratory test results of adult patients admitted to the G-ICU and C19-ICU of a tertiary hospital in Sumar\u00e9 (HES), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, from January 2020 to December 2020. The patients were characterized by sex, age, length of stay, clinical outcome (discharge or death), and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. The performance of triggers in detecting ADRs was determined by calculating positive predictive value (PPV). ADRs were characterized by severity, mechanism, causality, and suspected drugs. The 2020 spontaneous reporting database at the HES was analyzed, and ADRs from the ICUs were identified. The study evaluated 135 patients (56.3% from the G-ICU and 43.7% from the C19-ICU), with a predominance of males (54.8%) and a mean age of 61.0 \u00b1 15.1 years. The mean hospital stay was 13.0 \u00b1 11.0 days, the average SOFA score throughout hospitalization was 8.4 \u00b1 3.8, and the ICU mortality rate was 69.6%. Of the 135 admitted patients, 55 (40.7%) presented with at least one ADR, of which 31 (52.5%) were admitted to the C19-ICU. The length of hospitalization was associated with the presence of ADR in both ICUs studied and age only in the C19-ICU. Additionally, patients admitted to the C19-ICU had a 2.4 times higher risk of developing ADRs. A total of 85 ADRs were identified, 65 (76.5%) of which occurred through triggers. The triggers with the best performance in detecting ADRs, with a PPV of 100%, were \"Partial Thromboplastin Time >50,\" \"Skin Rash,\" \"Protamine,\" and \"Hydroxyzine.\" Most ADRs were moderate (56.5%), Type A (96.5%), and classified as possible (64.7%). Insulin was the drug most frequently associated with ADRs, with 22 occurrences. Only five ADRs in ICU patients were spontaneously reported in 2020. Of all the patients, 40.7% experienced at least one ADR during hospitalization. The number of ADRs identified by the trigger tool was significantly higher than those reported spontaneously. This demonstrates that using triggers to investigate ADRs is an effective method to significantly enhance an institution's pharmacovigilance actions."}

Apalutamide and N-desmethyl apalutamide were analysed by quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to measure the concentrations among individuals and the effect on the baseline level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and adverse events. The linear range, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery, carryover, and stability were appropriate according to the FDA and EMA validation guidelines. The apalutamide blood concentration range of the 24 patients was 0.517-7.27 \u03bcg/mL, and the median value was 4.92 \u03bcg/mL. The N-desmethyl apalutamide blood concentration range was 1.78-8.32 \u03bcg/mL, and the median value was 5.71 \u03bcg/mL. The median serum PSA level decreased from 61.03 (range 0.57-885.93) ng/mL at baseline to 0.970 (range 0.01-47.9) ng/mL at week 4. Therapeutic drug monitoring can help evaluate the individual differences between patients taking apalutamide. A dose of 180 mg could reduce the baseline PSA level significantly (p < 0.05), and the incidence of skin rash was less compared to that of a dose of 240 mg."}

The patient presented with a widespread skin rash characterized by erythematous papules and plaques that evolved into targetoid lesions, with no mucosal involvement or systemic symptoms. The treatment with a tapering dose of prednisolone resolved the rash without interrupting PBZ therapy. The report reviews the existing literature on PBZ-induced EM as a rare cutaneous toxicity associated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Prompt recognition and appropriate management of EM are crucial. The discussion emphasizes the importance of distinguishing it from more severe conditions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Decisions regarding the continuation of PBZ therapy should be made collaboratively by dermatologists and oncologists, considering the patient's overall health and cancer treatment plan.Key PointsImmune-checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab have revolutionized cancer treatment, though skin toxicities can complicate therapy.EM is a rare side effect of pembrolizumab, occurring in only 0.1% of patients, usually without affecting mucous membranes.Cases of pembrolizumab-induced EM vary in severity but generally respond well to corticosteroids.Quick identification of EM is essential, and treatment continuation should be carefully considered based on cancer type and severity."}

Drugs associated with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome include anticonvulsants, allopurinol, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Fluconazole is an exceedingly rare cause of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, with only one previously reported case in abstract form. We present a case of a woman with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis who developed fluconazole-induced drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, presenting with an unusual clinical feature. A 19-year-old Hispanic woman was taking fluconazole for pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. A total of 30 days after starting fluconazole, she developed a generalized skin rash. Despite this, she continued taking the medication. Then 1 week later, she experienced facial swelling and a sensation of \"throat closing.\" She also developed fever, axillary lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and hepatitis. Fluconazole was discontinued, and she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which led to an overall improvement in her condition. During hospitalization, her antifungal therapy was switched to posaconazole. However, within 24 hours, she again experienced the \"throat closing\" sensation, which was relieved with an epinephrine injection. The patient was discharged on Day 6 with oral methylprednisolone. Again, 9 days after discharge, her symptoms recurred, including facial swelling and new skin rashes. She was readmitted and treated with famotidine, corticosteroids, and diphenhydramine. Her general condition and skin rashes gradually improved, with complete resolution of the rash 3 months after the initial eruption. We present a case of a woman with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis who developed drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome induced by fluconazole. Our case meets Bocquet's diagnostic criteria and is categorized as \"definite\" drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms by the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome is a T-cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction; however, our patient also exhibited a unique symptom-a sensation of \"throat closing\"-suggestive of angioedema and a Type I hypersensitivity component. This symptom appeared while she continued fluconazole after the onset of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and recurred upon the initiation of posaconazole. Although both fluconazole and posaconazole belong to the triazole antifungal class, true allergic cross-reactivity medicated by IgE is rare probably due to their structural differences. This suggests cross-reactivity may occur even with structurally unrelated drugs in drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome. Clinicians managing suspected cases of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome should promptly discontinue the offending drug and exercise caution when prescribing alternative medications to minimize the risk of further hypersensitivity reactions."}

Pirfenidone and nintedanib are the approved treatments for IPF. This study evaluated the real-world safety and tolerability profiles of pirfenidone and nintedanib in IPF patients treated at the Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies (IRCCS ISMETT). A comparative analysis was conducted based on the number, types, and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and to identify potential predictors of treatment discontinuation or ADR onset based on patient characteristics. A retrospective observational study was conducted on 531 IPF patients treated at IRCCS ISMETT with either pirfenidone or nintedanib. Eligible patients were selected based on the logged monthly dispensations provided by the pharmacy service for both therapies. Covariates were extracted from electronic medical records (age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, comorbidities, forced vital capacity (FVC) %, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) %, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), polytherapy, oxygen therapy, drug switch, etc.). ADRs were categorized by severity and follow-up status, and further classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, specifying the Preferred Terms and the related System Organ Classes. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and univariate and multiple logistic regression identified potential risk factors for ADR onset. Backward Stepwise logistic regression (BSLR) was used to determine independent variables associated with ADR occurrence. The nintedanib group had more frequent ADRs related to gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disorders, with nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss as the most common. The pirfenidone group had more ADRs related to skin, nervous system, and vascular disorders, such as rash, nausea, dizziness, and blood pressure imbalances. Significant baseline differences between groups included age, smoking status, FVC (%), DLCO (%), and 6-MWT, with the nintedanib cohort showing worse baseline characteristics. A total of 450 ADRs were reported: 59.6% for nintedanib and 40.4% for pirfenidone. Independent variables that significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing ADR were drug change, treatment type, gender, and age. Identifying ADR predictors is essential for personalizing treatment strategies. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib are crucial in managing IPF, highlighting the need for further research to optimize personalized therapies and patient outcomes. Safety, tolerability and predictive factors of ADRs in IPF treatment Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, interstitial and life-threatening lung disease classified as a rare disease. Two medications, pirfenidone and nintedanib, are approved to slow the progression of IPF, but both can cause side effects. This study aimed to compare these treatments and identify factors that might predict which patients are more likely to experience side effects. Researchers at IRCCS ISMETT analyzed the medical records of 531 patients with IPF treated with pirfenidone or nintedanib over a period of eight years starting from May 2014. They looked at factors such as age, smoking history, lung function, and other health conditions to understand how these might influence the likelihood of side effects. The study found that patients taking nintedanib were more likely to experience digestive issues like nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. In contrast, patients on pirfenidone were more prone to skin rashes, dizziness, and changes in blood pressure. Overall, side effects were reported more frequently with nintedanib. Certain factors made side effects more likely: being older, taking nintedanib instead of pirfenidone, switching treatments, and gender, with men being less affected. The nintedanib group also had worse lung function at the start of treatment compared to the pirfenidone group. These findings underline the importance of tailoring treatment to each patient\u2019s needs to reduce side effects and improve outcomes. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib remain vital for managing IPF, but further research is needed to enhance personalized care and improve quality of life for patients."}

Although commonly regarded as trivial, it involves complex neurobiological mechanisms and diverse behavioral phenomena observed across species. Two distinct forms exist: knismesis, a mild tingling sensation elicited by gentle touch, and gargalesis, an intense sensation associated with involuntary laughter. Advocating the importance of clearly distinguishing these two types of ticklishness, this review synthesizes current knowledge on their neuronal underpinnings. Topics include somatosensory processing, self-tickling and sensory attenuation, emotional modulation, sociosexual dimensions, and evolutionary perspectives, among others. Special attention is given to the ambivalent nature of gargalesis, challenging conventional single-dimensional models of emotional valence. Ultimately, studying ticklishness provides a valuable opportunity to investigate playful emotional experiences from a naturalistic perspective, addressing fundamental yet underrepresented questions in contemporary neuroscience. Far from trivial, ticklishness thus provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying complex, context-dependent emotional and social experiences."}

Although ASMR is recognized as a cross-modal experience, psychological and physiological mechanisms behind ASMR remain only partially understood. Across two experiments, we investigated these mechanisms. Experiment 1 showed that ASMR videos with combined audiovisual content elicited stronger tingling sensations than those with auditory-only content, suggesting an additive effect through sensory processing. In Experiment 2, we measured responses to ASMR and nature videos using finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and found that both types of videos reduced pulse rates compared to rest. Notably, ASMR videos caused a greater reduction in pulse rate than nature videos. These findings are discussed in relation to autonomic nervous system activation, cross-modal interactions, and the social grooming hypothesis, which posits that ASMR may replicate comforting effects of social bonding behaviors, such as grooming."}

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of transauricular VNS (ta-VNS) in preventing POD in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. This multicentre, participant-blinded and assessor-blinded, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial will compare the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing major surgery who receive ta-VNS versus sham stimulation. A total of 300 eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the active or sham stimulation group. The active stimulation group will receive electrical stimulation to the left cymba conchae at a frequency of 30 Hz and a pulse width of 250 \u00b5s, with a 30 s on/30 s off cycle. The intensity will start at 0.4V and be increased in 0.4V increments until a tingling sensation is felt, then adjusted to the highest tolerable level without pain. After obtaining informed consent and randomisation, the initial intervention will begin in the preoperative area and continue throughout the surgery. For the four postoperative days, the intervention will be administered twice daily in 2-hour sessions each morning and afternoon. The sham group will follow the same procedure, with electrodes placed on the left cymba conchae. After adjusting the stimulation intensity, the device will be switched off.

Its diagnosis is challenging because the presentation varies depending on the type and location of the affected blood vessels. Ergot alkaloids, including ergotamine, are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. Concurrent use of ergotamine with CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly increase the risk of ergotism. However, this potentially dangerous drug interaction is often underestimated in general practice. Herein, we report the case of a middle- aged woman with a history of migraine headaches, who was treated with Cafergot (ergotamine tartrate and caffeine). After the initiation of human immunodeficiency virus therapy with Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), she experienced recurrent episodes of bluish discoloration, livedo reticularis and tingling sensation in her upper and lower extremities over several years. Despite multiple hospital visits and extensive diagnostic workups, including normal blood investigations and biopsy, the correct diagnosis of ergotism-induced vasospasm due to ritonavir-ergotamine interaction was delayed. This diagnosis was supported by CT angiography, which demonstrated vasospasm of the femoral arteries. The patient's symptoms significantly resolved following ergotamine discontinuation. Ergotism is a self-limiting condition that can be fatal if not recognised and treated promptly. This case highlights the importance of awareness, particularly in primary care settings, on the potential drug interaction, principally in patients receiving drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as protease inhibitors.

This study aimed to probe the efficacy of JHD on AKI and clarify its potential mechanism in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. An integrated tactic, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, pharmacodynamics, molecular biology, and metabolomics, was employed to illuminate the pharmacological mechanisms of JHD in treating AKI. Firstly, network pharmacology was adopted to predict potential drug targets and molecular pathways of AKI by utilizing the active ingredients in JHD. Secondly, molecular docking was used to explore the affinity between the active ingredients of JHD and AKI targets. Thirdly, biochemical analysis and histopathology were performed to estimate JHD's impact on cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid/immunofluorescence staining, and untargeted metabolomics were performed to understand the underlying mechanisms in vivo. In silico analysis identified 184 active compounds and 394 targets of JHD. Topology analysis based on the PPI network indicated 7 main targets. The GO and KEGG enriched signaling pathways pointed to metabolic changes due to JHD's effects on AKI. Molecular docking screening revealed that TP53, SRC, MAPK1, MAPK2, and AKT1 were the key targets of JHD. Further molecular biology and untargeted metabolomics experiments revealed that fatty acid uptake (CD36) and lipogenesis (sphingolipids, phospholipids, and neutral lipids) mediated by the p53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway may be involved in the protective effects of JHD against AKI in vivo. JHD exerted therapeutic effects on AKI by regulating fatty acid uptake and lipogenesis via the p53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway."}

These findings have enhanced our understanding of the phenolic profile of strawberries and lay the groundwork for further research into the physiological roles of strawberry phenolics."}

However, the detection rate of TP53 mutations in ctDNA of HGSOC patients has previously been shown to be inadequate. Given the prevalence of copy number aberrations (CNAs) in HGSOC, this study aimed to improve ctDNA detection by combining TP53 sequencing with shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS), and to evaluate the correlation with clinicopathological features and survival outcomes. This exploratory, retrospective cohort study included 53 advanced-stage HGSOC patients, comprising 18 treatment-naive patients and 35 patients treated with two neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles. TP53 targeted sequencing was integrated with sWGS (<5x coverage) for CNA estimation using ichor copy number aberration tumor fraction (ichorCNA TF). TP53 mutations were detected in 28 patients (52.8 %), and 17 patients (32.1 %) showed positive ichorCNA TF. Combining TP53 mutation detection with ichorCNA TF identified 62.3 % (n = 33) of patients as ctDNA-positive, showing a trend towards improved detection compared to TP53 mutation alone (p = .063). Treatment-naive patients exhibited higher TP53 mutation (72.2 % vs. 42.9 %, p = .043) and ichorCNA TF (66.7 % vs. 14.3 %, p < .001) detection rates compared to chemotherapy-treated patients. No correlations between ctDNA metrics and clinicopathological characteristics or survival outcomes were found. In conclusion, the integration of ichorCNA TF with TP53 mutation analysis showed a trend towards improved ctDNA detection in advanced-stage HGSOC patients. Future studies should further explore ctDNA detection rates by ichorCNA TF and its potential clinical implications in HGSOC."}

However, their relationship remains unclear. This study aims to explore the relationship between angiogenesis-related genes and TACE failure in patients with HCC and to develop a predictive model for assessing treatment outcomes. Somatic mutation profiles of 165 patients with HCC treated with TACE were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to calculate the genetic risk score (GRS) for angiogenesis-related gene mutations. The participants were randomly divided into training and validation groups. In the training set, independent prognostic factors of TACE-treated patients with HCC were screened using univariate Cox-LASSO-stepwise Cox regression, and a nomogram was established and evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis of the two sets. Among 165 patients, significant genetic alterations were identified, with TP53 being the most frequently mutated gene. Mutations in FGFR4, MST1R, and RECK were associated with the treatment efficacy of patients receiving TACE treatment, and the constructed GRS was associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, AFP, ALT, AST, PLR, PD-L1 immune drug treatment, and GRS were confirmed as independent factors affecting the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with TACE. A nomogram was constructed, which demonstrated excellent discrimination, calibration, and clinical benefits in both the training and validation sets. These findings highlight the critical role of angiogenesis-related genes in predicting TACE outcomes in patients with HCC and indicate that the developed prognostic model and nomogram can serve as valuable tools to predict prognosis based on the GRS of angiogenesis-associated gene mutations.

Patients received standard AZA in combination with IBR at two dose levels (DL), 420 mg (DL1) and 560 mg (DL2). Twenty-one patients were enrolled, including 17 with high- or very high-risk disease and six with prior HMA therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the dose escalation cohorts. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and febrile neutropenia. Bleeding events occurred in 14 patients (67 %), with a grade 3 event in one patient. The overall response rate was 48 %, including 3 (14 %) complete remissions (CR) and 4 (19 %) marrow CR.

Deciphering the timing of driver mutations may lead to insights into tumor evolution that can inform diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for LUAD. Here, we conducted whole-genome sequencing on LUAD samples from 251 patients with Chinese ancestry to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of somatic alterations, especially those across the non-coding regions. Tobacco-related mutations preferentially occurred early and plateaued at 28 packs of cigarettes per year. Well-known driver mutations (e.g., EGFR, TP53, and RB1) also occurred at the early stage, displaying ancestry heterogeneity among smokers. In contrast to exogenous mutagens, endogenous mutagen-related alterations (APOBEC) occurred late. The 3'UTR was the most frequently altered non-coding element in LUAD, with recurrent disrupting mutations in the 3'UTR of SFTPB and SFTPA1. Unlike other cancer types, TERT promoter mutations were observed specifically among female LUAD patients. Clustered mutations (e.g., doublet-base substitutions, multi-base substitutions, and kataegis) influenced LUAD evolution and were overrepresented in driver genes.

IHC was performed to analyze lung-specific markers, transcription factors, and epithelial markers reflecting the structural composition of the bronchial tree and alveolar system. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted to identify mutations and fusions. CPAM type 1 was found in 50%, type 2 in 22%, and type 3 in 6%. A mixed pattern of types 1 and 2 was observed in 22%. The epithelial lining was strongly positive for CK7 and TTF-1 in all samples. Expression for Napsin A, Surfactant A, p40, CK5/6, and CK20 varied within and between subtypes. P40 and CK5/6 were more enriched in type 1 compared to type 2. MCCs occurred in 17%. Mutations were found in 24% (9 \u00d7 KRAS; 2 \u00d7 FGFR2). Besides classical KRAS mutations (G12D, G12V), two cases showed a double-mutation pattern (G12D/G12V; G12D/TP53). In all MCC cases, the same mutation with comparable allele frequencies was found in mucinous and non-mucinous areas. No fusions were detected. The presence of mixed-type patterns supports the hypothesis that CPAM represents a continuum of developmental disturbances occurring at various stages of lung branching morphogenesis. This is further corroborated by the divergent protein expression patterns. Our study confirms recent findings that the same KRAS mutations occur in mucinous and non-mucinous areas. The identification of additional mutations, including potential co-mutations, underscores the need for further investigation into molecularly defined CPAM subtypes."}

Cryptococcal meningitis, caused by C. neoformans, has a high mortality rate and poses a significant threat to global public health. Research indicates that C. neoformans employs various strategies to cross the BBB, with transcellular transport being particularly critical. We observed that C. neoformans infection significantly upregulates the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Silencing EGFR using siRNA technology resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of C. neoformans to traverse the BMEC monolayer. Furthermore, C. neoformans infection also upregulates EGFR ligands, such as HB-EGF, in BMECs, thereby activating the EGFR signaling pathway. This activation involves the engagement of ADAM family metalloproteinases and the metalloprotease Mpr1 from C. neoformans.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying lenvatinib resistance in HCC and identify potential interventions. We established lenvatinib-resistant HuH7 and Hep3B cell lines and conducted in vitro, bioinformatics, and biochemical assays to explore and validate the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to lenvatinib in HCC. Additionally, cellular xenograft models of lenvatinib-resistant HCC were utilized to assess tumor responses to a novel drug treatment regimen. Our findings revealed a shift from suppression to activation in the expression of p-ERK1/2 and Cyclin D1 in HCC cells as they transitioned from sensitivity to resistance to lenvatinib. Furthermore, we demonstrated that targeting ERK1/2 with ravoxertinib (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) could significantly enhance the sensitivity of resistant HCC cells to lenvatinib therapy. Through transcriptome data analysis and experimental validation, we identified amphiregulin (AREG), induced autocrinely by lenvatinib, as a critical mediator that activates the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, leading to increased Cyclin D1 expression in HCC cells. Mechanistically, lenvatinib promotes aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) nuclear translocation, directly activating AREG transcription. Using in vivo models, we further confirmed that inhibiting ERK1/2 with ravoxertinib or AHR with CH-223191 (an AHR inhibitor) could overcome lenvatinib resistance in HCC. Overall, lenvatinib-induced AHR activation promotes AREG expression, which subsequently facilitates the acquisition of drug resistance in HCC via the EGFR-ERK1/2-CyclinD1 signaling axis. Targeting ERK1/2 and AHR effectively improved the response to lenvatinib treatment in resistant HCC."}

However, tumor progression to acquired resistance significantly hinders long-term efficacy. While the involvement of transcription factors in EGFR-TKI resistance has been extensively investigated, the contribution of transcriptional co-repressors like Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 1 (TLE1) remains largely unexplored. This study identifies TLE1 as a mediator of insensitivity to EGFR-TKI treatment in lung adenocarcinoma positive for EGFR mutation. Analysis of patient data indicated that elevated TLE1 level was associated with unfavorable survival outcomes among patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD, underscoring its clinical significance. In vitro, specifically in PC9 and HCC827 cells, exogenous TLE1 expression promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduced cellular response to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and osimertinib. Conversely, sole downregulation of endogenous TLE1 expression partially restored drug sensitivity in PC9GR and HCC827GR acquired resistance cell line models. At a mechanistic level, TLE1 functions as a co-repressor, interacting with ZEB1 to suppress E-cadherin expression, a key EMT marker, thereby facilitating resistance. This paper provides first evidence of TLE1 driven EMT-associated failure of EGFR-TKI treatment particularly in EGFR-mutant LUAD through its co-repressor activity. These results underscore the previously underappreciated role of transcriptional co-repressors in therapeutic resistance and position TLE1 as a promising prognostic and therapeutic target.

Therefore, our study aimed to identify active biosurfactants, their potential targets, and the accompanying signaling pathways for the therapy of H. pylori using a network pharmacology approach. We selected twenty biosurfactants from the literature for further investigation. Our analysis identified 119 potential therapeutic targets for H. pylori infection out of the 706 putative targets of biosurfactants and the 913 disease-related targets. GO analysis revealed that these 119 targets were significantly enriched into multiple GO functional categories, such as cell proliferation, and inflammatory response regulation were prominently impacted. Further, through KEGG analysis, signaling pathways, such as the HIF-1 signaling pathway, coronavirus infection, and epithelial cell signaling in H. pylori infection. Protein-protein interaction analysis further revealed 25 core targets as potential targets in the network. Molecular docking was employed to validate the efficacy of biosurfactants against the supposed targets. Remarkably, we observed that biosurfactants like athrofactin, liposan, lichenysin, sophorolipid, and amphisin exhibited strong binding affinities for the proteins EGFR, SRC, MAPK14, JUN, CXCL8, and CASP3, which are participating in the epithelial cell signaling pathway in H. pylori infection.

The Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among 752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test completion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, and was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host factors were collected from biennial research questionnaires. There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a high probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 vs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer prevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low probability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women with a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those with a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04). The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation carriers.

Angiosarcomas and other special breast cancer subtypes, such as triple negative apocrine carcinomas, metaplastic carcinomas, and a subset of ER-positive carcinomas (mucinous and micropapillary carcinomas, neuroendocrine neoplasms) have not been associated with specific genetic underpinnings but are enriched for certain genetic features and oncogenic pathways. The identification of characteristic genetic alterations or their molecular surrogates can be useful to establish an accurate diagnosis, and in some cases, may point to potentially actionable therapeutic targets. This review aims to summarize the genetic landscapes of less common benign and malignant breast tumors, with special attention to genotype-phenotype correlations and to the diagnostic utility of genetics and surrogate markers when applicable. BRCA1/2-associated breast carcinomas will also be discussed due to the association of so-called BRCAness with basal-like histology."}

In preclinical studies PI3K inhibition led to increased DNA damage and subsequent sensitization to PARP inhibition. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of an mTOR/pan-PI3K inhibitor, gedatolisib, with the PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer or advanced HER2 negative breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation. The primary objective of the safety run-in was safety and tolerability of the combination and for dose escalation to find the maximum tolerated dose. A 3 + 3 design was utilized for dose escalation. The primary objective of the phase II study was objective response rate (ORR) in the patients with wildtype germline BRCA1/2. The prespecified efficacy threshold was 20%. Secondary objectives included progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as correlative testing, examining homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. The combination of gedatolisib and talazoparib carried manageable toxicities with a low incidence of grade 3 adverse events. The most common adverse events of all grades were anemia, fatigue, and oral mucositis. The ORR in the phase II study was 12%. There were no new safety signals identified in the phase II study. mPFS was 2.5 months (95% CI 1.71, 9.89), and mOS was 7 months (95% CI 4.3, NA) in the full phase II cohort. HRD status was analyzed by high (\u2265 33) or low (< 33) genomic instability score, and there was no difference in response rate between the groups. The combination of gedatolisib and talazoparib is safe but did not meet the prespecified efficacy threshold for objective response rate. Additional preclinical studies of these pathways are warranted prior to future clinical trials of the combination. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03911973, Date of registration: 2019-04-11."}

Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, the only treatment demonstrated to improve the prognosis of patients with mCRPC, are also being developed for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). To fully assess their potential benefit in this setting, it is essential to understand how BRCA and HRR defects may influence the prognosis of conventionally treated patients with low- and high-disease volume. Eligible mHSPC patients diagnosed between January 2018 and December 2023 underwent paired somatic/germline DNA sequencing. Cases with alterations in \u22651 HRR gene were classified as BRCA, HRR non-BRCA, non-BRCA or non-HRR. Radiographic progression-free survival, time to castration resistance, and overall survival were reported for all subgroups; associations between mutations and outcomes were assessed after controlling for treatment modality and baseline characteristics using inverse probability of treatment weighting models. Of 556 patients, 159 (28.6%) had HRR gene alterations: 69 (12.4%) with BRCA and 90 (16.2%) with HRR non-BRCA mutations. mHSPC was synchronous in 451 patients (81.1%) and was classified as high-volume (CHAARTED criteria) in 306 (55%) patients. Within the HRR subgroup, patients with BRCA mutations had significantly worse outcomes across all endpoints (P < 0.005 for all comparisons). Differences in prognosis by BRCA and HRR status were observed in both low- and high-volume subgroups and were independent of treatment with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors or taxanes. Presence of HRR mutations, particularly BRCA alterations, significantly worsened prognosis, regardless of disease volume or treatment regimen. These findings underscore the importance of integrating tumour biology for accurate risk stratification in mHSPC and the design of new treatment strategies and follow-up."}

However, in the clinical oncology setting it is still restricted to large panel sequencing limiting capacity for routine biomarker screening. In this article, we describe our experience of tailoring amplicon-based library construction for the MGI platform. Illumina compatible reagents served as a prototype in order to introduce platform specific adapters. Elaborated reagent kits were used for BRCA1/2 or 34 oncogenes testing both with whole blood and FFPE-derived DNA. Our data show that amplicon-based DNBSEQ-tailored library preparation demonstrates sufficient analytical efficiency in terms of coverage uniformity (average MAPD 1.08 and 1.19 for ABC plus and Atlas plus panels) and amplicon drop-out rate (ranging from 0.3% to 2.5%). Additionally, it shows efficiency in terms of single sample sensitivity, maintaining 99% sensitivity compared to 99% for the Illumina prototype. We show that it also outreaches expected diagnostic parameters of MGI exome sequencing (99% vs 95% for WES). Per-amplicon coverage of sticky-end libraries sequenced on Illumina and MGI were highly correlated demonstrating that the platform itself does not introduce any bias to amplicon coverage. Across three tested variations of library preparation protocol, discordances were related to ligation mix component composition and resulted in underrepresentation of GC-low and GC-high amplicons and low uniformity as a result. Overall, we outline the successful adaptation of PCR-based library preparation for MGI signifying the importance of tailoring component composition of reagent kit for uniform coverage."}

We observed a high prevalence of BRCA1 epimutation in blood cells from early-onset TNBC patients with no cancer-predisposing PVs (38/112, 33.9% [95% confidence interval: 25.4-43.6%]) as compared to early-onset patients with cancer-predisposing PVs (1/87, 1.1% [0.1-7.1%], p value < 0.001) and late-onset patients (11/93, 11.8% [6.3-20.6%], p value < 0.001). These differences remained significant when restricting to epimutations with low variant epiallele frequencies (VEF under 1%).

ENCODE data show strong overlap of the Kaiso promoter-binding site-encode-derived Kaiso-binding site (eKBS) and many other transcription factors, including BRCA1. Here we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is a component of the Kaiso enhanceosome that regulates gene transcription. Using proximal ligation assays, immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, luciferase assays and ChIP-seq experiments, we evaluated the association between BRCA1 and Kaiso. Kaiso nuclear extract immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Kaiso associates strongly with genes involved in RNA splicing and processing. When Kaiso was not crosslinked to DNA, BRCA1 was not detected among Kaiso-binding proteins. However, overexpression of BRCA1 increased Kaiso-mediated gene transcription in luciferase assays in a Kaiso-dependent manner. Comparison of BRCA1 ChIP-seq and Kaiso ChIP-seq data from HCT116 cells revealed both BRCA1 and Kaiso commonly bind to the promoters of 379 genes. The most enriched term associated with these genes where BRCA1 and Kaiso bind their promoters is metabolism of RNA. Disease processes associated with these BRCA1/Kaiso gene promoters indicate that BRCA1 is functionally linked to a Kaiso-directed programme of RNAP2-mediated gene transcription and likely associated with colorectal cancer development and maintenance."}

This cross-sectional study extends from a longitudinal observational study of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that has been ongoing since 1995. The Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment was administered from 2017 to 2020 among 752 women with a BRCA mutation in Canada and the United States. The probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment was derived from the age at test completion and 2 memory task results from the Cogniciti Brain Health Assessment, and was categorized as high or low. Self-reported details on clinical and host factors were collected from biennial research questionnaires. There were 21 (2.8%) women with a high probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 731 (97.2%) women with a low probability. Women with a high probability were on average older at the time of cognitive assessment (63.9 vs 57.4 years, p < .001) and less likely to undergo oophorectomy for cancer prevention (55.0% vs 86.3%, p < .001) compared with women with a low probability. Among those who underwent oophorectomy for cancer prevention, women with a high probability were older at the time of surgery compared with those with a low probability (55.0 vs 46.3 years, p = .04). The findings suggest no short-term impact of bilateral oophorectomy on the probability of amnestic mild cognitive impairment among BRCA mutation carriers. A higher probability was predominantly attributed to older age at cognitive assessment. It is prudent to continue to monitor this population for potential long-term adverse effects following preventive surgery or cancer treatment."}

For female breast and prostate cancer, a significant interaction between BRCA2 and PGS was found (HR < 0.83, p < 0.05); the effect of PGS on cancer risk was weaker in carriers than noncarriers. The probability of cancer by age 75 years (P BRCA2 PVs increase risk beyond core HBOC cancers and their risks are modified by cancer-specific PGS.

A scoping review was conducted, including 21 independent studies. Patient data from these studies were analysed and reviewed alongside relevant biological and lifestyle factors. The studies reported standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for a second primary colorectal cancer (CRC) following a melanoma diagnosis ranging from 0.62 to 1.55, while SIRs for a second primary melanoma following a CRC diagnosis ranged from 0.89 to 1.55. Males exhibited a higher risk of developing either CRC or melanoma as a second primary cancer (SPC). An inverse relationship between age and the development of CRC was observed, with younger individuals having a higher risk. African-American populations demonstrated a higher prevalence of melanoma and CRC as SPCs compared to Caucasian and other racial groups. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and the intake of red and processed meats were associated with an increased risk of developing melanoma or CRC. Genetic mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were commonly implicated in the development of both melanoma and CRC, while mutations in CDKN2A and BRCA2 were specifically significant in melanoma. The association between melanoma and CRC incidence was confirmed through analysis of current literature and is influenced by various biological, lifestyle, and genetic factors.

Familial intestinal gastric cancer (FIGC) has been defined clinically, but it remains mostly genetically unexplained. Likewise, the heritability of mixed histology GC remains to be known. We aimed to estimate the frequency of known cancer predisposition gene variants in GC cases with and without a cancer family history, diverse histological subtypes, and varied age of onset. We evaluated the contribution of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in well-established moderate-to-high penetrance multi-organ cancer predisposition genes for GC risk in a large international multi-centre retrospective cohort study involving 750 patients with GC of early-onset or family history of cancer, either by panel sequencing or whole exome sequencing (WES). Panel sequencing was conducted on 328 cases, while WES was performed on the remaining 422. Tumour sequence analyses were performed on samples from 15 patients with P/LP variants. Mutations identified in five index cases were also tested in their relatives. We identified 45 patients (6%) with P/LP variants in: ATM (17 cases), BRCA2 (10 cases), MLH1 (five cases), TP53 (three cases), BRCA1, PALB2, RAD51D, and CHEK2 (two patients each), and RAD51C and PMS2 (one case each), all of which were mutually exclusive. The P/LP variant prevalence was higher in intestinal (9.8%) than in diffuse (4.3%) or mixed GC (4.5%) (p-value = 0.023), without difference per mutated gene by histological subtypes. Only 16 of the 45 patients who carried P/LP variants fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network genetic testing criteria of at least one cancer predisposition syndrome. Our findings indicate that a broader panel of cancer predisposition genes, beyond CDH1 and CTNNA1, should be included in gene panels to investigate germline variants in patients with GC. This would be especially beneficial when there is a family history of cancer, irrespective of histology subtype, as it would increase the chance of identifying patients who could benefit from risk reduction, targeted treatment, and surveillance of other cancer types.

Sensitivity analysis, including heterogeneity tests for dependent instruments, were conducted to validate the findings. The prognostic relevance of the identified candidate targets was assessed using transcriptomic data. Functional interactions were explored via protein-protein interaction network analysis, while single-cell analyses were employed to determine cell-specific expression patterns and differentiation trajectories. Potential side effects and therapeutic indications of these targets were evaluated using phenome-wide association studies and pharmacological data mining. Following meta-analysis, a primary significant target, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5), along with potential targets FUT8 and KLK13, were identified as therapeutic candidates for LUAD. FUT8 demonstrated a positive association with LUAD risk (OR = 1.02, p = 0.049), while ICAM5 (OR = 0.88, p = 0.002) and KLK13 (OR = 0.85, p = 0.021) exhibited negative associations. ICAM5 was further identified as an independent prognostic factor for patient survival (HR: 0.788, 95% CI: 0.663-0.936, p = 0.007) and revealed significant diagnostic and prognostic utility in LUAD. ICAM5 expression correlated with various immune infiltration patterns, suggesting potential modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Single-cell analysis revealed that ICAM5 did not directly impact LUAD cell differentiation, though its downstream target, MUC1, may contribute to differentiation processes, particularly in KRAS-mutated LUAD. Furthermore, phenome-wide association studies did not reveal substantial evidence of adverse phenotypes linked to ICAM5, supporting its safety profile for drug development.

Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG 281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, molecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer provide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies demonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 inhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the response to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and endocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited treatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates precise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies leveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical for refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National Comprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients with hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer."}

Developing therapies that trigger potent, yet manageable, immune responses capable of eliminating highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor cell populations remains a key challenge. Here, we harness multiple genetic approaches to develop a CAR-T cell therapy targeting tumors. First, we screen binders targeting oncogenic KRAS G12V mutations presented by peptide-MHC complexes. Subsequently, we incorporate these neoantigen binders into CAR-T cells (mKRAS NeoCARs) and demonstrate their efficacy in xenograft models of metastatic lung, pancreatic, and renal cell cancer. Finally, we enhance the in vivo efficacy and safety profile of mKRAS NeoCARs via inducible secretion of IL-12 and T cell receptor deletion. Together, these screening and engineering processes provide a modular platform for expanding the therapeutic index of cellular immunotherapies that target cancer."}

IDO-1-related immune suppression is due to decreased tryptophan availability and to the generation of tryptophan metabolites, culminating in substantial suppression of T-lymphocytes. Here we investigate IDO-1 expression in 2 cohorts of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, both in tumor cells and in immune infiltrate, with correlation of IDO-1 to PD-L1 expression, clinical patient demographics and outcomes. Evaluation first utilized an exploratory cohort of 259 NSCLC samples obtained from 122 patients followed by a second validating cohort of 1,200 NSCLC samples obtained from 437 patients. All tumor samples were collected from patients who underwent surgical lung resections. IDO-1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Correlations were assessed using Spearman and Kendall tests. A Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was used to assess if overall survival (OS) was associated with IDO-1 positivity in univariate and multivariable settings. In the validating cohort of 437 patients IDO-1 expression was positive in 111 (25.4%) with an H-Score \u2265 1. IDO-1 expression was determined to be greater in tumor immune infiltrate, with 406 patients (93.8%) determined as positive. Both continuous and binary versions of tumor H-Score showed a significant positive correlation with the amount of tumor immune infiltrate (0.1806 and 0.1698, p < 0.0001). None of the analyzed variables (age, sex, histology, stage, EGFR, KRAS and PD-L1 status) were found to display a significant correlation with IDO-1 positivity in tumor and immune cells. IDO-1 positivity in tumor cells was found to be significantly associated with OS in the univariate setting and in the multivariable model [P-value = 0.009 and 0.021, respectively; HR: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55-0.95)]. IDO-1 positivity in immune cells was found to be significantly associated with OS in the univariate setting and was borderline significant in the multivariable model [P-value = 0.006 and 0.053; HR: 0.798 (95% CI: 0.635-1.003)]. Our results suggest a prognostic role of IDO-1 protein expression in NSCLC tumor and immune cells independent of EGFR, KRAS AND PD-L1 expression, and should be explored as a predictive biomarker in clinical studies with IDO-1 targeted therapies."}

Historically, KRAS had been a very difficult target due to its strong binding to GDP/GTP and the lack of available druggable binding pockets. Considerable advances have been achieved in generating direct small-molecule inhibitors selectively targeting KRAS G12 mutations. This review discusses the development of approaches to design inhibitors that bind directly to KRAS, starting from the pioneering work of the Shokat group. This review details significant milestones of KRAS-targeted drug discovery and the current impediments in this field. The identification of covalent inhibitors of the KRAS G12C and more recently a direct inhibitor of K-Ras G12C in a GTP-bound state exemplifies the promise of this approach. Structure-guided drug design improved the basis for understanding the mutations in KRAS, notably at codon 12, and the idea has potential for gene therapy. Focusing exclusively on direct and indirect KRAS inhibitors, this review highlights the evolving strategies transforming KRAS from an elusive target to a tractable therapeutic opportunity, offering new hope for patients with KRAS-driven cancers."}

Possible findings are foci of mucinous cell clusters (MCCs), harboring KRAS mutations. Studies combining morphology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular data are scarce. A total of. 46 CPAM lesions were assessed by conventional histomorphology. IHC was performed to analyze lung-specific markers, transcription factors, and epithelial markers reflecting the structural composition of the bronchial tree and alveolar system. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted to identify mutations and fusions. CPAM type 1 was found in 50%, type 2 in 22%, and type 3 in 6%. A mixed pattern of types 1 and 2 was observed in 22%. The epithelial lining was strongly positive for CK7 and TTF-1 in all samples. Expression for Napsin A, Surfactant A, p40, CK5/6, and CK20 varied within and between subtypes. P40 and CK5/6 were more enriched in type 1 compared to type 2. MCCs occurred in 17%. Mutations were found in 24% (9 \u00d7 KRAS; 2 \u00d7 FGFR2). Besides classical KRAS mutations (G12D, G12V), two cases showed a double-mutation pattern (G12D/G12V; G12D/TP53). In all MCC cases, the same mutation with comparable allele frequencies was found in mucinous and non-mucinous areas. No fusions were detected. The presence of mixed-type patterns supports the hypothesis that CPAM represents a continuum of developmental disturbances occurring at various stages of lung branching morphogenesis. This is further corroborated by the divergent protein expression patterns. Our study confirms recent findings that the same KRAS mutations occur in mucinous and non-mucinous areas. The identification of additional mutations, including potential co-mutations, underscores the need for further investigation into molecularly defined CPAM subtypes."}

We demonstrate here that KRAS, including its various activating mutants, is subjected to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation in cancer cells. Through a siRNA-based screening of deubiquitinases, we identified USP25 as a deubiquitinase for KRAS. Depleting USP25 expression increases ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of KRAS, leading to the suppression of its oncogenic activity. We further show that USP25 inhibitors we have discovered are capable of destabilizing KRAS in cancer cells and are efficacious in blocking tumor xenograft growth in mice.

We explore the novel molecular mechanisms linking IR and A\u03b2 aggregation, focusing on the interplay between ABC transporters and Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Furthermore, we also explore emerging evidence linking ABC transporters to oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction critical factors in the development of amyloidogenesis.

In this study, we investigated the mechanistic uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from macrophages into palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxic hepatoma cells. By co-culturing macrophages with lipotoxic Huh7 cells in a transwell system, we demonstrated that PA-treated Huh7 cells exhibited impaired uptake of macrophage-derived EVs. Compared with control Huh7 cells, PA-treated Huh7 cells presented a reduction in the expression of macrophage-derived microRNA-223 (miR-223) after co-culture, accompanied by an increase in the expression of miR-223 target genes. Further analysis revealed that upon PA treatment, the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in Huh7 cells and EV uptake activity were simultaneously diminished. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments of LDLR in Huh7 cells revealed a crucial role of LDLR in facilitating EV uptake. Mechanistically, we elucidated that PA induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequently stimulated proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-mediated LDLR degradation. Administration of a PCSK9 inhibitor rescued LDLR levels and increased EV uptake in PA-treated Huh7 cells from macrophages. Moreover, we found that the uptake of macrophage-derived EVs lacking apolipoprotein E (ApoE) by Huh7 cells was lower than that of control EVs, highlighting the role of ApoE as a facilitator of EV transfer from macrophages into Huh7 cells. Overall, our study highlights the intricate mechanisms underlying EV-mediated communication between macrophages and Huh7 cells during lipotoxicity and provides insight into the development of EV-based therapies for MASLD."}

Additionally, the levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) and network pharmacology were used to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of JWYY in the treatment of GU. Changes in potential hub genes and pathways related to the therapeutic effects of JWYY were assessed using western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence analyses. The protective effects of potential active ingredients were evaluated in vitro models. The administration of JWYY significantly decrease the UI and alleviated gastric hemorrhagic necrosis, submucosal edema, and destruction of epithelial cells in mouse model of GU. JWYY markedly suppressed IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MDA levels, and restored mucosal integrity (ZO-1 expression). RNA-seq revealed dual roles of JWYY, including the inhibition of JAK2-STAT3/NF-\u03baB pathways to attenuate inflammation and the rescue of activation of PI3K-AKT/DNA repair pathways to enhance cell survival. Network pharmacology and UPLC-MS/MS identified quercetin, morin, naringenin, catechin as key bioactive components, which bind to JAK2/PDGFRA, decreased inflammation, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis in vitro. This study deciphers the multi-target, multi-pathway mechanisms underline the JWYY in the treatment of alcohol-induced GU, integrating TCM principles with modern pharmacology. The identified bioactive components and pathways provide a scientific foundation for clinical usage of JWYY and indicated the important of targeting JAK-STAT/NF-\u03baB signaling in the treatment of GU. These bioactive components not only explain the mechanism of complex TCM formulations but also can be used to improve the therapeutic efficacy."}

Identifying therapeutic targets and drugs for this disease is of critical urgency. However, traditional drug discovery often overlooks cell communication signals. Here, our single-cell omics data and in vivo experiments of the murine coal pneumoconiosis model revealed that a subpopulation of neutrophils with high expression of S100a8 enhanced the communication between neutrophils and macrophages. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that inhibiting S100a8 could mitigate coal dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we employed Paquinimod, an S100a8 inhibitor. Our data demonstrated that Paquinimod alleviated coal dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis by blocking the neutrophil-S100a8-Tlr4-macrophage signaling axis, suppressing the Tlr4/p38MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway, lowering phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB p65. These inhibitions reduced inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1) and fibrotic markers (\u03b1-SMA, Fibronectin, TGF-\u03b21), slowing fibrosis progression and improving lung function. Furthermore, the neutralization effect of recombinant S100a8 protein on Paquinimod's efficacy underscored the pivotal role of neutrophil-S100a8-Tlr4-macrophage communication. In conclusion, our study elucidates the critical role of S100a8 in coal dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis and highlights the potential of S100a8 inhibition by Paquinimod as a therapeutic strategy. These findings provide insight into potential treatments for pulmonary complications associated with coal pneumoconiosis."}

Clinicopathological and sociodemographic data, taste test results and subjective taste analysis, salivary flow, quality of life, ECOG performance status, body mass index (BMI), body surface area and other side effects were recorded. The saliva obtained was stored at -80 \u00baC after addition of the protease inhibitor (Sigma; P2714-1BTLL), salivary TNF-\u03b1 was measured using the TNF-alpha ELISA kit for human (ELH-TNFa-5, RayBio\u00ae) following the manufacturer's recommendation. The data was analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, Spearman and Wilcoxon chi-square/Fisher's exact tests with all analyses adopted a 95 % confidence level in the SPSS for Windows software. The group without dysgeusia (WD) had a longer chemotherapy time than the group with dysgeusia (D) (p < 0.001) and a higher frequency of toxicity during CT than the D group (p = 0.012), the mean BMI increased slightly from 28.16 \u00b1 5.34-28.30 \u00b1 5.39 (p = 0.016), an increase which only occurred in the WD patients (p = 0.030) and not in the D patients (p = 0.106). There was a correlation with taste parameters, with an inversion between salivary TNF-\u03b1 levels and the taste test (p = 0.033, r = -0.288). In the control group, salivary TNF-\u03b1 concentration was directly correlated with VAS scale scores (p = 0.044, r = 0.266).

The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of Withania Somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS) as a chemoprophylactic and immunomodulatory agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a 12 week, randomized, open label, parallel group, two arm, comparative, multicentric, controlled trial compared WS with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in health care workers (HCWs). Total 400 HCWs were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either oral WS (500 mg for 12 weeks) or HCQ 400 mg (for 7 weeks). The primary outcome was to establish equivalence between WS and HCQ for the proportion of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven participants contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection: 5 in WS arm and 2 in HCQ arm. The equivalence between WS and HCQ was established for the proportion difference of participants contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection for per-protocol (PP) (1.6%, 95% CI: -1.08%-4.33%) and in subgroup analysis (ITT, mIIT, non-vaccinated and seronegative). Notably, the immunomodulatory effect of WS stood scientifically validated by the statistically significant difference in cytokine levels (p < 0.0001) at 12 weeks compared to baseline for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were most frequent (53 in WS and 58 in HCQ). Headache and sneezing were observed only with HCQ. Participant global assessment showed excellent tolerability with both treatment arms. WS was found equivalent to HCQ as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 infection with no safety concern. WS is thus inferred to be an effective and safe Ayurvedic intervention for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also as an immunobooster."}

Current therapeutic approaches for ischemic stroke are limited, particularly in targeting the interconnected mechanisms of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. There is a critical need for effective neuroprotective agents that address these pathways to mitigate I/R-induced injury. Here, we used bioinformatics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ischemic stroke and performed enrichment analysis to uncover hub genes and signaling pathways central to disease progression. MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, was identified as a promising candidate and investigated for its neuroprotective efficacy in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) models. MG-132 treatment significantly reduced infarct size, decreased cerebral edema, and improved neurological outcomes. Mechanistically, MG-132 downregulated PTGS2 expression, inhibited NF-\u03baB activation, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17. Furthermore, MG-132 alleviated oxidative stress and apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and fewer TUNEL-positive cells. These findings demonstrate that MG-132 exerts robust neuroprotection by modulating the PTGS2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, addressing key pathological processes in I/R injury. This study provides a foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies that mitigate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in ischemic stroke, advancing the search for effective interventions in this critical area of unmet medical need."}

Atherosclerosis and its related cardiovascular diseases are the major causes of death worldwide. Our previous preliminary study showed that anthocyanin-rich extract (ACNE) from Xinjiang wild cherry plum (Prunus divaricata Ledeb) fruit peels exhibited anti-atherosclerotic effect. However, the potential mechanism of this health-beneficial effect remains unclear. Here, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was used to tentatively address this issue. The ACNE mainly contains cyanidin, cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy3Glu), Cyanidin 3-(6''-acetylglucoside) (Cy3AcGlu), cyanidin 3-galactoside (Cy3Gal), cyanidin 3-xyloside (Cy3Xyl), and cyanidin 3-rutinoside (Cy3Rut). Seven key targets, EGFR, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, SRC, HIF1A, CXCR4 and IGF1R were identified from core protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Anthocyanins interacting on key targets were initially demonstrated by molecular docking, particularly Cy3Rut and Cy3Xyl having highest affinity with most key targets. Biological function analysis suggested that key targets were involved in several biological processes, including positive regulation of cell migration, positive regulation of phosphorylation, inflammatory response, response to hypoxia, etc. The significantly enriched pathways, such as HIF-1 signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, macrophage stimulating protein MSP signaling network map, were closely related to atherosclerosis. Altogether, based on the comprehensive analysis and discussion, we revealed that TLR4/EGFR and IGF1R-CXCL12/CXCR4 pathways were at least partially implicated in the anti-atherosclerotic effects of anthocyanins through affecting inflammation, endothelial homeostasis, and foam cell formation. This study served as a theoretical basis for further validating the underlying anti-atherosclerotic mechanism of anthocyanins via in vitro and in vivo experiments."}

Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying CRC liver metastasis and resistance to immune therapy remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving CRC metastasis using a novel approach, which includes the establishment of highly metastatic CRC cell lines. To explore the role of specific genes in CRC liver metastasis, we developed two highly metastatic CRC cell lines (LoVo-Hm and HCT116-Hm) by applying sustained selective pressure to primary CRC cells. RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in these metastatic cells. Additionally, we conducted assays for cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and ELISA to evaluate VEGFA production, all to confirm the functional role of SLC9A2. Our findings were further validated in human CRC tissue samples and publicly available datasets to assess the clinical relevance of the identified targets. Our analysis revealed a significant downregulation of SLC9A2 in the highly metastatic CRC cell lines. Mechanistically, we found that SLC9A2 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, SLC9A2 reduces VEGFA secretion, normalizing tumor vasculature and reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME), which ultimately enhances anti-tumor immunity. Comparative analysis of CRC tissue samples showed reduced SLC9A2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, with a negative correlation to TNM staging. Importantly, higher SLC9A2 expression was associated with better treatment responses in immunotherapy cohorts. These findings highlight the critical role of SLC9A2 in regulating metastasis, angiogenesis, and TME remodeling in CRC. By modulating the STAT3 pathway and tumor vasculature, SLC9A2 emerges as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Targeting SLC9A2 may enhance immune responses and improve treatment outcomes in CRC, offering a promising avenue for future therapeutic strategies."}

Many researchers have previously reported that natural compounds from plants or Chinese Traditional Herbs have a potential to treat NSCLC. But it has not been reported that phytol can treat NSCLC. In this research, we first exposed this effect on A549 cells and researched the mechanism. In order to evaluate whether phytol has a role in human NSCLC, a human non-tumoral bronchial epithelial cell line (NL20), adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cell line, and NCI-H69 SCLC (H69) cell line were used for related experiments. After determining that phytol had no toxicity to NL20 cells, A549 cells, or H69 cells, the inhibitory effect of phytol on cancer cell related characteristics of cells were determined by luciferase assay, QRT-PCR, proliferation, invasion, and would healing cellular response experiments. Additionally, the quantification of apoptotic cells has been achieved through flow cytometry. Then, bioinformatics was used to establish a database to screen and speculate on phytol's corresponding targets in lung cancer. Finally, immunoblotting experiments were used to determine the specific pathways affected by phytol. Treatment with phytol at concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 \u00b5M for 24 hours was not cytotoxic to the A549 cells and H69 cells. Phytol inhibited AP-1-mediated and NF-\u03baB-mediated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells, but not H69 cells. Additionally, phytol significantly inhibited the levels of MMP9, IL-6, VEGFA, IL-8, and NFKBIA in A549 cells, but had no significant effects on H69 cells. Phytol induced significant dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects on A549 cells. A significant decrease in colony formation and migration was observed. Bioinformatic and immunoblotting analysis indicated that phytol inhibited proliferation and migration of A549 cells through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Phytol exhibits anticancer activity by inhibiting PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and may be applicable in the clinical prevention and treatment of lung cancer in the future."}

The results showed that compared with the model group, the tumor weight and volume were smallest in the 2\u22361 group. The expression levels of PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, HIF-1\u03b1, VEGFA, and TGF-\u03b21 were significantly decreased, and the protein expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased, while the protein expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, MMP2, and MMP9 was significantly decreased. Additionally, the protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 was significantly increased, and Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly decreased. In vitro experiments showed that after intervention with AC-medicated serum at a 2\u22361 ratio, the cell activity, adhesion, invasion, and migration of 143B cells were significantly reduced, apoptosis was significantly increased, and HUVEC tube formation was significantly decreased. In conclusion, the 2\u22361 ratio of AC showed the most effective inhibition of 143B cell growth.

Our study has used miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in HAVD patients compared to workers exposed to hand-transmitted vibration. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have been utilized to explore the role of miR-100-5p in endothelial cell dysfunction. Our results reveal that 36 miRNAs were upregulated and 2 miRNAs were downregulated in HAVD patients. Notably, miR-100-5p and miR-4735-5p exhibited the most significant differential expression.The area under the curve (AUC) for miR-100-5p in distinguishing hand-transmitted vibration-exposed workers from healthy individuals was 0.9906, while its AUC for identifying HAVD was 0.9922. The combination of those two miRNAs as the diagnostic marker of HAVD showed great potential has higher AUC, with high sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, miR-100-5p might mediate the pathology of HAVD by inhibiting vascular cell angiogenesis via VEGFA/VEGFR pathway, which could be regulated by decreased TRIB2 expression and inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway."}

PDLSCs were isolated from healthy individuals and periodontitis patients. To mimic inflammatory conditions in vitro, PDLSCs from healthy individuals were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured with conditioned media from PDLSCs, and their proliferation, migration, and tube formation were detected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic capacity of PDLSCs. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) levels were measured using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, Immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. UCHL1 was knocked down using shRNA to validate its function and regulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to verify the interaction of UCHL1 with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), and chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 on YAP transcription. UCHL1 inhibitor was administered in a periodontitis murine model to investigate its function in vivo. The pro-angiogenic capacity of PDLSCs from periodontitis patients was enhanced, accompanied by increased expressions of VEGFA and ANGPT1, which were positively correlated with UCHL1 expression. UCHL1 knockdown in PDLSCs abrogated the increased secretion of VEGFA and ANGPT1 and the enhanced pro-angiogenic capacity under inflammatory conditions. Mechanistically, UCHL1 functioned through facilitating YAP expression and nuclear translocation, a process that was mediated by the stabilization and activation of HIF-1\u03b1, which in turn promoted YAP transcription. In vivo inhibition of UCHL1 in a periodontitis murine model alleviated aberrant angiogenesis and reduced the expressions of VEGFA and ANGPT1, thus attenuating periodontitis progression by reducing lymphocyte infiltration, inflammatory cytokine levels, and alveolar bone resorption. This study demonstrated that UCHL1 promoted the pro-angiogenic capacity of PDLSCs in periodontitis through the HIF-1\u03b1/YAP signaling, which provides insights into the pathogenesis of periodontitis and paves the way for novel treatment strategies."}

Here, using a lung cell atlas of 311,748 single cell RNA-Seq profiles, we identify 687 ionocytes (0.45%). In contrast to prior reports claiming a lack of ionocytes in the small airways, we demonstrate that ionocytes are present in small and large airways in similar proportions. Surprisingly, we find only 3 mature tuft cells (0.002%), and demonstrate that previously annotated tuft-like cells are instead highly replicative progenitor cells. These tuft-ionocyte progenitor (TIP) cells produce ionocytes as a default lineage. However, Type 2 and Type 17 cytokines divert TIP cell lineage in vitro, resulting in the production of mature tuft cells at the expense of ionocyte differentiation. Our dataset thus provides an updated understanding of airway rare cell composition, and further suggests that clinically relevant cytokines may skew the composition of disease-relevant rare cells."}

A retrospective monocentric observational study included 62 CF children treated with CFTR modulators. Data were collected at initiation and after one year of treatment. The primary objective was to describe the evolution of hepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulator treatment. We identified hepatobiliary involvement before treatment in 37 patients (59.7 %). Fifteen had persistently (during >6 months) elevated liver enzymes (mostly ALT); 17 had abnormal ultrasound including 3 with nodular liver and 3 with pathological elastography; 5 had isolated splenomegaly. Biliary involvement was found in 19 patients. The evolution of hepatic parameters in the overall population was not significant (p > 0.05). However, we observed a trend towards improvement in laboratory values under treatment. There was only one inaugural diagnosis of nodular liver under LI and none under ETI. All patients had preserved liver function (PT>50 %). We did not find a significant improvement or worsening of hepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulators. We hypothesize that it could be stabilized with these treatments, but this will need confirmation through further studies with longer follow-up and larger cohorts. The other hypothesis proposed is that biological monitoring may not be an accurate assessment of the hepatobiliary response to modulators. This study supports the safety of CFTR modulator use."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "CFTR", "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease caused by dysfunctional or absent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is expressed in immune cells and regulates innate immunity, both directly and indirectly. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) contributes to dysfunction in CF airway epithelial cells. However, the impact of non-CFTR ion channel dysfunction on CF immune responses is not understood. Improved understanding of how immune function is regulated by ion channels may allow antibiotic- and mutation-agnostic treatment approaches to chronic infection and inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that ENaC is aberrantly expressed in CF macrophages and directly contributes to impaired phagocytic and inflammatory functions. ENaC expression was characterized in immune cells isolated from CF and non-CF blood donors. Monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) function and bacterial killing was tested with ENaC modulation. Baseline ENaC expression in human CF MDMs, lymphocytes, and granulocytes was increased at both the transcript and protein level relative to non-CF and persisted after infection. CFTR inhibition in non-CF MDMs resulted in ENaC overexpression. CFTR modulator treatment reduced but did not eliminate ENaC overexpression in CF MDMs. Interestingly, ENaC inhibition increased CFTR expression. Amiloride-treated CF MDMs also showed normalized ROS production, improved autophagy, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Sodium channel expression in CF MDMs normalized after Amiloride treatment with minimal effect on other ion channels. In summary, ENaC modulation in immune cells is a novel potential therapeutic target for CF infection control, either in combination with CFTR modulators, or as a sole agent for people not eligible for CFTR modulators."}

It is caused by a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which results in the absence or damage of a relevant protein. If left untreated, it causes death in early childhood. The advent of more efficacious treatments has resulted in a notable increase in the life expectancy of CF patients. This has, in turn, led to an elevated risk of developing specific types of cancer. This review commences with an examination of CF from the standpoint of its etiology and therapeutic modalities. Subsequently, it presents a list of epidemiological studies that suggest an altered predisposition to certain cancers. A heightened risk is well documented, particularly in relation to the gastrointestinal tract. The following section addresses the role of CFTR in view of its potential involvement in the progression of various types of cancer. Several studies have indicated that the levels of the CFTR protein are reduced in many tumors and that this reduction is associated with the progression of the tumors. These decreased expressions are known to occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, bladder, and/or prostate cancer. Conversely, ovarian, stomach, and cervical cancer are connected with its higher expression.

Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequency of genotypes was analyzed by the Chi-square test and odds ratio for relative risk. The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT genotypes of MTHFR C677T were 17.65%, 54.90%, and 27.45% in cases and 64.71%, 15.69%, and 19.61% in controls, respectively.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of silicon-enriched meat (Si-RM) on the brain cortex of T2DM rats. Rat models of early-stage-T2DM (ED) (n = 8) and late-stage-T2DM (LD) (n = 16) were induced by high-saturated fat diet and high-saturated fat high-cholesterol diet plus streptozotocin/nicotinamide injection, respectively. A control meat (C-RM) was included in the diet of both ED and LD groups. Finally, after confirming hyperglycemia in LD rats, the C-RM was replaced by Si-RM in half of the animals for the last five weeks of the study, obtaining the LD-Si group (n = 8), while the other half continued eating C-RM. In LD rats pathological outcomes included: harmful oxysterol profile, decreased antioxidant defenses, neuroinflammation, brain IR, augmented glucose uptake and impaired cholinergic transmission. Si-RM consumption ameliorates these key outcomes by reducing brain levels of pro-oxidant oxysterols (25-OHC and 27-OHC) to levels of ED rats. Antioxidant defenses, including SOD and arylesterase activity, were enhanced, and inflammatory markers, such as GFAP, IL6, and TNF\u03b1, were reduced compared to LD and ED counterparts. Notably, silicon restored brain insulin signaling, normalized glucose uptake via GLUT3, and shifted to an acetylcholine-preserving profile, significantly mitigating neurodegenerative risks.

Multiparous pregnant Holstein cows had lactation terminated (i.e. dried-off) at 232 \u00b1 5 days of gestation and were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: cooling (CL; access to the shade of a barn plus forced ventilation via fans and water soakers over the feed lane to provide active evaporative cooling) or heat-stress (HT; access to the shade of a barn and natural ventilation, no active cooling) for the entire duration of their dry period. Maternal plasma (n = 28/trt) cortisol concentrations were measured at days -14, -7 prior to and at parturition. At delivery, placental cotyledonary tissue samples were collected and analyzed for gene expression (n = 4-5/trt). During the final weeks of gestation, treatment impacted plasma cortisol concentrations as calving approached (p = 0.04), wherein HT dams exhibited lower plasma cortisol concentrations than CL dams at -14 days (9.65 vs. 13.09 \u00b1 1.5 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and at parturition (16.97 vs. 22.32 \u00b1 1.4 ng/ml; p < 0.001), combined with significant changes in placental gene pathways associated with acute inflammation and cortisol synthesis and secretion. Specifically, pathways related to interleukin-6 (IL6) and NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), which regulate inflammation, were upregulated by HT, suggesting placental inflammation. Additionally, pathways involved in nutrient transfer and amino acid metabolism were impaired, as HT downregulated key genes responsible for these functions, especially serine biosynthesis. These findings indicate that HT during late gestation leads to dysregulation of cortisol secretion pattern in maternal plasma, resulting in reduced cortisol levels in the HT animals. Additionally, it also caused placental inflammation impacting feto-maternal transfers, highlighting the importance of late gestation period on fetal development and managing maternal environmental stressors in dairy production."}

Thuja occidentalis L., a medicinal plant native to Southern Punjab, Pakistan, is evaluated for its potential anticancer properties through a combination of computational and experimental approaches. A comprehensive screening identified 87 bioactive compounds, from which four isothujol, p-coumaric acid, cedrol, and kaempferol were selected for further analysis on the basis of their oral bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking studies indicated strong binding affinities between these compounds and key breast cancer-related targets, including PARP1, ESR1, MDM2, EGFR, and HIF1A. A Venn diagram and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed 16 common targets that are likely involved in the plant's anticancer effects. KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses identified 26 cancer-related pathways, including breast cancer, estrogen signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Molecular docking showed binding affinity ranges between -6.2 and -9.6 kcal/mol. The cytotoxic effects of two T. occidentalis extracts, ethyl acetate and n-hexane, were assessed using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, with significant inhibition at concentrations as low as 25 \u00b5g/mL, whereas the n-hexane extract showed limited activity. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed the presence of key bioactive compounds, such as thujone, cedrol, kaempferol, and quercetin, known for their anticancer properties. In silico studies also suggested that isothujol may induce cancer cell apoptosis by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and modulating pro-apoptotic factors. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of T. occidentalis, highlighting its potential as a source of therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment.

Despite evidence linking BPA exposure to neuronal damage and cognitive impairments, its underlying mechanisms and core targets remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study employed an integrated metabolomics and network toxicology strategy to elucidate the neurotoxic mechanisms of BPA. Zebrafish embryos were subjected to BPA exposure (0.05, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L) from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Neurotoxic effects were assessed via developmental and morphological observations, behavioral analyses, metabolomics profiling, and transcriptional examinations. BPA exposure disrupted zebrafish larval development, suppressed central nervous system (CNS) neurogenesis, altered cardiac function, and induced significant neurobehavioral deficits. In addition, metabolomics analysis identified disruptions in glutamate metabolism as a key contributor to BPA-induced neurotoxicity. Utilizing databases such as comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD), ChEMBL, and GeneCards, we identified potential neurotoxicity-associated targets, further refined through STRING and Cytoscape analyses. Enrichment analysis using Metascape and molecular docking via Autodock revealed strong binding affinities between BPA and core targets, including PRKACA, ESR2, MMP9, PTGS2, DRD1, AR, and ESR1. Moreover, the BPA-ESR2 interaction and BPA-PRKACA interaction were further validated via SPR assay.

This study sought to explore the potential mechanisms through which DAI alleviates alcohol-induced acute GU in rats. In this study, in vitro and in vivo models of alcohol-induced GU were established and employed a range of experimental techniques, including Immunofluorescence (IF), Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western Blotting (WB), and Real-time quantitative PCR (RT- qPCR), to assess the protective effects of DAI. Next, network pharmacology, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to identify the potential targets and mechanisms responsible for DAI's therapeutic action on GU. Finally, the activation of the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway was validated in both a rat model and a GES-1 cell model. DAI was shown to alleviate inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, while mitigating the reduction of H\u207a/K\u207a-ATPase and EGFR, thereby restoring the gastric barrier. In both in vitro and in vivo models, DAI showed stable binding to key residues of ESR1 (Leu387A, Arg394A, His524A, and Glu353A), and subsequently activated the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway. Notably, Fulvestrant (a selective ESR1 inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) both abrogated the activation of this pathway. DAI inhibited apoptosis and preserved mucosal integrity by targeting ESR1 to activate the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway.

We identified 137 ovarian damage-related and 143 infertility-related ATBC targets, refined to 19 and 30 hub genes respectively. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in apoptosis, oxidative stress response, and PI3 K-AKT signaling (p < 0.05).

The core target genes and potential signaling pathways related to HGWD in OA treatment were analyzed using network pharmacology analysis. BMSCs were isolated from rats to induce for adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation, which were assessed by Oil Red O staining and Alizarin Red staining, respectively. ESR1 knockdown lentivirus was transfected into BMSCs and different concentrations of rat HGWD-containing serum was prepared to treat BMSCs. Cell proliferation activity was measured by CCK-8 assay to select the optimal concentration for further experiments. Cells were treated with 10% HGWD-containing serum and transfected with ESR1 knockdown lentivirus. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by ALP staining, ALP activity measurement, and Alizarin Red staining. The expression of osteogenic differentiation-related genes OCN, RUNX2, and COL1A1 was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that ESR1 is one of the core targets of HGWD in OA treatment. HGWD-containing serum promoted proliferation and osteogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs, and also increased ESR1 expression. The promoting effects of HGWD-containing serum on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were partially polished in response to ESR1 knockdown in BMSCs.

In this study, we employed network pharmacology, molecular docking, transcriptomic approaches, and experimental verification to investigate the potential targets of MitoQ in vitiligo. Molecular docking results identified four possible crucial targets of MitoQ in vitiligo treatment: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3). MitoQ alleviated oxidative stress-induced PARP1 nuclear mislocalization, attenuated ROS accumulation, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhanced ATP synthesis in vitro analysis. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that MitoQ reduced the expression of DNA damage genes and genes involved in the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The protein-protein interaction network indicated a potential relationship between PARP1 and DNA damage-related genes, suggesting that MitoQ could interfere with abnormal PARP1 activation. Notably, MitoQ reduced cellular senescence by decreasing CDKN1A/p21 protein through PARP1, and the knockdown of PARP1 reduced oxidative damage. These results indicate that PARP1 decreases cellular senescence and offers a potential target for therapeutic research in the management of vitiligo."}

An integrated tactic, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, pharmacodynamics, molecular biology, and metabolomics, was employed to illuminate the pharmacological mechanisms of JHD in treating AKI. Firstly, network pharmacology was adopted to predict potential drug targets and molecular pathways of AKI by utilizing the active ingredients in JHD. Secondly, molecular docking was used to explore the affinity between the active ingredients of JHD and AKI targets. Thirdly, biochemical analysis and histopathology were performed to estimate JHD's impact on cisplatin-induced AKI mice. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid/immunofluorescence staining, and untargeted metabolomics were performed to understand the underlying mechanisms in vivo. In silico analysis identified 184 active compounds and 394 targets of JHD. Topology analysis based on the PPI network indicated 7 main targets. The GO and KEGG enriched signaling pathways pointed to metabolic changes due to JHD's effects on AKI. Molecular docking screening revealed that TP53, SRC, MAPK1, MAPK2, and AKT1 were the key targets of JHD. Further molecular biology and untargeted metabolomics experiments revealed that fatty acid uptake (CD36) and lipogenesis (sphingolipids, phospholipids, and neutral lipids) mediated by the p53 and SRC-ERK/AKT signaling pathway may be involved in the protective effects of JHD against AKI in vivo.

DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a highly toxic lesion, jeopardizing genome stability. Using cytogenetic and differential exome sequencing, we show here that upregulation of the kinase PKB/AKT1 leads to genomic rearrangements and chromosome fusions. By combining various approaches, at the genome scale and at precise loci, we show that PKB/AKT1 stimulates DSB end-joining, leading to inter- and intrachromosomal genomic rearrangements. The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex plays an essential role in the early steps of DSB signaling/repair. We show here that PKB/AKT1 favors the assembly of MRN, leading to the stimulation of DSB signaling via the MRE11/ATM axis. We identify MRE11 as a phosphorylation effector of PKB/AKT1 and reveal several sites whose phosphorylation is required for PKB-mediated stimulation of DSB end-joining and chromosome fusions. These data reveal that PKB/AKT1 actively promotes genetic instability by increasing the efficiency of DSB end-joining through MRE11 phosphorylation on these sites. These results highlight that not only a defect of DSB signaling/repair but also its stimulation, can lead to genome rearrangements and underline the importance of a precise regulation of the DNA damage response to maintain genome stability."}

Here, we identify Tomosyn-2 as a key regulator of \u03b2-cell maturation. Tomosyn-2 expression declines with age in mouse islets, coinciding with enhanced biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and reduced \u03b2-cell proliferation. Genetic deletion of Tomosyn-2 improves glucose tolerance, elevates plasma insulin levels, and augments islet insulin secretion, without altering systemic insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, Tomosyn-2 interacts with syntaxin-1A (Stx1A) to inhibit insulin granule exocytosis by limiting SNARE complex formation. Transcriptomic and network analyses reveal that Tomosyn-2 loss reprograms gene expression to strengthen the coupling between insulin secretion and proliferative pathways. Its deletion also reduces \u03b2-cell proliferation and mass expansion, suppresses cell cycle and Akt1 signaling, and promotes \u03b2-cell identity, maturation, and altered islet architecture.

Interestingly, non-glandular trichomes recorded a significant growth under CDS, suggesting a potential adaptive response of stevia at 15 days after treatment (15 DAT). Additionally, unique differential gene expression recorded under CDS (9643 DEGs) emphasizes a distinct transcriptional response compared to single (D) and (S) stress in stevia. Moreover, stress-specific specialized metabolism, including sphingolipid, arginine and proline, and biosynthesis of various plant secondary metabolites revealed significant enrichment under CDS.

Although HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab result in significantly improved clinical outcomes, the total pathological complete response (tpCR) rate remains suboptimal, particularly among hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients [2]. Neoadjuvant therapy plays a critical role in facilitating tumor downstaging in locally advanced cases and provides a valuable opportunity to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and guide adjuvant treatment. Consequently, the development of novel anti-HER2 agents and combination strategies has become a major focus of ongoing researches. Inetetamab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 with an engineered Fc domain to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, represents a promising candidate for improving treatment outcomes [3, 4]. In this issue of Cancer Letters, Zuo and colleagues present findings from a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical trial investigating a neoadjuvant regimen combining inetetamab, pertuzumab, and nab-paclitaxel (TIP regimen) in patients with early-stage or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer [5]. Through comprehensive evaluation of both efficacy and safety, the study demonstrates exceptional therapeutic potential of the TIP regimen, with a high tpCR rate observed in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients, indicating particular promise for this subgroup of HER2-positive breast cancer."}

Between July 2018 and July 2023, we retrospectively screened 6536 patients with advanced NSCLC. A total of 183 patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC were identified, of whom 91 had BM. The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS). The median follow-up period was 18.1 months (range 5.0-39.7) at the cut-off date of December 28, 2023. Incidence of BM at diagnosis was 24.6 % (45/183), and overall BM incidence was 49.7 % (91/183). There was no significant difference in the lifetime incidence of BM between the HER2 exon20 YVMA insertion and non-YVMA insertion subtypes (p = 0.558). The median OS of 91 patients with BM was significantly lower than that of patients without BM (14.8 vs. 23.2 months, p < 0.001).

Fracture healing was assessed via radiography, histology, and biomechanical testing at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-surgery. MiRNA-130b overexpression enhanced BMSC proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation by directly targeting PTEN and activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

There was no significant difference in gene expression between severe and non-severe SLD groups. These findings suggest that the dysregulation of MeCP2 and PTEN may be involved in the pathophysiology of SLD, influencing SP and neuronal function. In conclusion, the altered expression of these genes in individuals with SLD highlights potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets, opening avenues for future research and intervention strategies."}

We designed a trial to assess the safety and impact of sirolimus on colon polyp burden in PHTS. We performed an open-label trial of sirolimus for one year in adults with a PTEN pathogenic variant and colon polyposis. The primary outcome was change in polyp burden and staging. Five participants were enrolled with 2 completing the planned study course. Baseline colonoscopies showed a mean polyp burden of 107 (range 31 - 184), with multiple histologic types. For the 2 patients completing the study, polyp burden decreased. Sirolimus has promise for reduction of colon polyp burden in PHTS, but side effects may limit usage. Future treatment trials in rare polyposis syndromes would benefit from the involvement of multiple centers to allow for improved recruitment."}

However, the molecular mechanisms potentially linking PFAS exposure to carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. This study integrates computational toxicology and bioinformatics approaches to explore how PFAS-related molecular targets and pathways may overlap with those altered in six cancer types: breast carcinoma (BRCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), thyroid cancer (THCA), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), all of which have been previously implicated in PFAS-related research. Potential protein targets of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were predicted using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and SwissTargetPrediction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the edgeR package. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed via STRING, and enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock to estimate PFAS-protein binding energies. PFAS-related targets were associated with dysregulation of key cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, metabolic reprogramming, and DNA repair. Core targets such as CDC20, CCND1, MYC, BIRC5, PTEN, and IL6 were identified across multiple cancers. Molecular docking predicted strong binding energies between PFAS and several of these targets, supporting their potential relevance in cancer-associated molecular processes. This study provides a hypothesis-generating toxicogenomic framework for exploring PFAS-associated molecular alterations across cancer types. These findings highlight potential PFAS-related targets and pathways that warrant further experimental investigation to better understand their relevance to human health and cancer risk."}

Using proteomics analysis of isolated mouse retinas across developmental stages and the mitophagy reporter mouse line, mito-QC, we characterized mitophagy throughout retinogenesis. While mitolysosomes were more prevalent in the mature retina, we observed two distinct mitophagy peaks during embryonic development. The first, independent of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) activation, was associated with RGCs. The second, PINK1-dependent peak was triggered after an increase in retinal oxidative stress. This PINK1-dependent, oxidative stress-induced mitophagy pathway is conserved in mice and zebrafish, providing the first evidence of programmed, PINK1-dependent mitophagy during development."}

Molecular glues may regulate protein stability and activity by inducing protein-protein interaction. Here, we find that verteporfin functions as a molecular glue, promoting IRE1\u03b1 dimerization and activation. Specifically, verteporfin binds to IRE1\u03b1, facilitating its dimerization, which relies on the His692 residue. This activation of IRE1\u03b1 triggers XBP1 splicing and miR-153-mediated downregulation of PTEN, along with AKT phosphorylation. Additionally, we identify the pro-metastasis gene BACH1 as a novel target of miR-153, which is downregulated by IRE1\u03b1 and verteporfin. While verteporfin inhibits breast cancer cell viability and invasion, its combination with an AKT inhibitor synergistically suppresses breast cancer progression.

While revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) restore blood flow, they can also exacerbate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, for which current cardioprotective strategies remain insufficient. MicroRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression, but the role of miR-100-5p in I/R injury remains unclear. This study demonstrates that miR-100-5p is significantly upregulated in myocardial tissue during I/R injury, leading to the downregulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). This reduction in PRMT5 impairs its capacity to methylate and inactivate Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), resulting in disruption of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and aggravated myocardial damage. Using antisense oligomers to inhibit miR-100-5p, we restored PRMT5 expression, reactivated PI3K-AKT signaling, and reduced cardiomyocyte death, thereby mitigating myocardial injury. Our findings identify the miR-100-5p/PRMT5/PI3K-AKT axis as a key regulatory pathway in myocardial I/R injury and highlight miR-100-5p as a potential therapeutic target to protect the heart during revascularization procedures."}

However, its role in bladder cancer (BLCA) remains unclear. Our study revealed that SFXN1 was enriched in clinical BLCA tissues, and high SFXN1 expression in BLCA was positively associated with the progression and poor prognosis. Further, SFXN1 deficiency remarkably suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of BLCA cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating an oncogenic role of SFXN1 in BLCA. Additionally, our results demonstrated that SFXN1 promotes metastasis through its unknown function of restraining PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1)-dependent mitophagy rather than its classical role as a mitochondrial serine transporter to mediate one-carbon metabolism. Mechanistically, SFXN1 acted as a bridge to promote PINK1 degradation by interacting with PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein) and MPP-\u03b2 (mitochondrial processing peptidase-\u03b2), leading to mitophagy arrest. Notably, when mitophagy was restrained by highly-expressed SFXN1, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were considerably enriched, thus activating TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoting metastasis of BLCA cells. This study highlights SFXN1 as a novel promising therapeutic target for BLCA and identifies a new mitophagic modulator to improve our understanding of an association between mitophagy and BLCA progression. Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism by which SFXN1 promotes bladder cancer metastasis by restraining PINK1-dependent mitophagy. SFXN1 is upregulated in BLCA tissues, and promotes BLCA metastasis through its unrevealed function of restraining PINK1-dependent mitophagy rather than its classical role as a mitochondrial serine transporter to promote cell proliferation. Specifically, SFXN1 acted as an essential bridging factor to promote PINK1 degradation by interacting with PARL and MPP-\u03b2 on the IMM, leading to mitophagy arrest and mtROS accumulation, thus activated TGF-\u03b2-mediated EMT and promoted BLCA metastasis (This figure was created by Figdraw)."}

Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and were compared with sporadic cancer and the general population using standardized mortality (SMR) and relative survival rates (RSR). Survival bias was addressed using left-truncation. Overall, 147 BC patients were included.

RIOK1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation by incorporating IGF2BP1 and G3BP1 into stress granules that sequestrate PTEN messenger RNA reducing its translation. This process activates the pentose phosphate pathway, facilitating stress resolution and cytoprotection against TKI. We further show that the small-molecule inhibitor chidamide downregulates RIOK1 and enhances TKI efficacy.

Here, we present the first case of an LCMN with an NTRK fusion driver event. The patient presented with an atypical proliferative nodule arising in the background nevus. RNA sequencing of the proliferative nodule with background nevus identified a pathogenic LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. The fusion resulted in constitutive expression of TrkA, demonstrated by strong cytoplasmic pan-TRK staining, along with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as indicated by positive nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for phosphorylated ERK. The background nevus beneath the proliferative nodule also expressed pan-TRK and phosphorylated ERK, suggesting that the NTRK1 fusion occurred prior to the formation of the proliferative nodule. This case broadens the spectrum of driver events for LCMN and suggests that screening for TRK fusions in LCMN should be considered when systemic therapy is being considered for melanoma or symptom management."}

MET exon 14 mutations affect splice sites and are highly heterogeneous which makes them difficult to detect. Because of the approval of capmatinib for patients with MET exon 14 mutated tumors and the related poor response to immunotherapy (ICI) for a subset of patients with MET mutated tumors, MET screening has become mandatory for first line treatment decision. Here we report our testing experience based on 1143 consecutive NSCLC addressed for molecular diagnosis. Two strategies using either DNA sequencing (NGS) and fragment analysis or DNA-RNA sequencing (NGS) were developed and validated to accurately detect MET exon 14 alterations including large deletions. For patients with MET tumors (n = 46), demographic characteristics, treatments and outcomes were obtained from medical records and discussed. 46 MET exon 14 alterations were identified, 4 were not called by DNA sequencing and rescued by fragment analysis or RNA sequencing. Sixty-seven percent tumors had a high PD-L1 expression > 50 and 42% of cases had co-occurring alterations, mainly TP53 mutations (24%) and PIK3CA mutations (9%). Response to MET inhibitors (Crizotinib and Capmatinib) was evaluated for 15 patients. The ORR (Objective Response Rate) and the median of PFS (Progression Free Survival) were 44% and 5.5 months [1.6-18.2 months] respectively. Thirteen patients were treated by immunotherapy, ORR and median PFS (Progression Free Survival) median were 30% and 4 months [0.7-55.5 months] respectively. The response to immunotherapy was not correlated with PD-L1 status but smokers seemed to better respond to ICIs. This study highlights that a multimodal approach may be necessary to detect MET exon 14 mutations as large deletions may not be detected by DNA sequencing. Targeted DNA-ARN sequencing strategies broadly interrogate the diverse druggable genomic variations and permits direct detection of altered splicing or gene fusions. Because patients with MET exon 14 mutated tumors, demonstrate low response to immunotherapy despite high PDL1 and because MET exon 14 is druggable the detection of MET mutations is mandatory to optimize treatment."}

Gene alterations were investigated within relevant cancer pathways, and the therapeutic potential was assessed. Lastly, univariate Cox regression analyses estimated hazard ratios. Among 51 included patient, TP53 was most frequently altered (88 %), followed by PIK3CA (35 %) and CCNE1 (33 %). Separate analysis of carcinoma and sarcoma components revealed concordant gene variants but divergent copy number variations. Based on molecular classification, the majority of the cases 44 (84.6 %) had a TP53mutant profile. Additionally, 11 cases were HR deficient, and 7 samples (14 %) had high TMB (\u226516). Key altered pathways were TP53, RTK/RAS, PI3K, and cell cycle pathways.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(NFE2L2), Lipoic Acid Synthetase(LIAS), Lipoyltransferase 1(LIPT1), Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase(DLD), Dihydrolipoamide Branched Chain Transacylase E2(DBT) and Dihydrolipoamide S-Succinyltransferase(DLST) were negatively correlated to immune score. Via Consensus clustering based on cuproptosis genes, the DN samples were divided into cluster C1 and cluster C2. Cluster C1 was characterized by low cuproptosis gene expression, high immune cell subtype infiltration, and high enrichment of immune-related pathways. Cluster C2 was on the contrary. Dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductase (DCXR) and heat-responsive protein 12 (HRSP12) were key genes related to clinical traits and immune microenvironment, negatively correlated with most immune cell subtypes. The nomogram constructed based on DCXR and HRSP12 showed good efficiency for DN diagnosis. Immune microenvironment imbalance and metabolic disorders may lead to the occurrence of DN. Cuproptosis genes, with the ability to regulate the immune microenvironment and metabolism, can be used for disease clustering to describe the heterogeneity and characterize the immune microenvironment. HRSP12 and DCXR, as key genes related to disease phenotypes and immune microenvironment characteristics, were jointly constructed as nomograms for DN diagnosis with high accuracy and reliability. HRSP12 and DCXR may be potential biological markers and renal protective factors."}

Our study aims to further investigate the disease among Naswar users at the genomic level to understand genetic diversity and discover new targeted therapy. A multi-centre descriptive cross sectional research was designed comprising a total of 80 cases of OSCC who were habitual users of Naswar. Out of the 80 cases, whole exome sequencing (WES) was applied to 7 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues of OSCC. We further investigated immunohistochemical expression of mutant TP53 and CDKN2A protein in tissues of 80 OSCC samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. Among the total 2,216 somatic variants identified in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs), we compared the high frequency mutation genes reported in OSCC in Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database with research samples, and found that TP53 (85.7%), NOTCH1 (85.7%), and FAT1 (85.7%) showed higher rate of mutation. Among single nucleotide variants, higher prevalence of C/T and G/A base change was noted. Interestingly, a distinct panel of 12 genes was detected to be mutated in 100% samples which was not previously reported compared to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP). PTPRT mutation (rs2867655) was present in seven samples and IGF2R (rs629849) was seen in two samples. A statistically significant relation was observed between mutant TP53 protein expression and duration of Naswar use and clinical stages while difference in CDKN2A protein expression was found to be statistically significant with respect to stage only. Our study presented preliminary data of genetic aberrations in patients exposed to known risk factor (Naswar). These findings can enhance the understanding of genetic aetiology and serve as basis for innovative targets of therapy."}

During distant metastasis, tumors were observed to accumulate copy number alterations (CNAs) to a much greater degree than mutations. In particular, the development of whole genome duplication was a common event during metastasis, emerging de novo in 28% of patients. Loss of 9p (including CDKN2A) developed during metastasis in 11% of patients. To a lesser degree, mutations and allelic loss in human leukocyte antigen class I and other genes associated with antigen presentation also emerged. Increasing CNA, but not increasing mutational load, was associated with immune evasion in patients treated with immunotherapy. Taken together, these data suggest that CNA, rather than mutational accumulation, is enriched during cancer metastasis, perhaps due to a more favorable balance of enhanced cellular fitness versus immunogenicity."}

This review examines current advancements in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of oligodendrogliomas, with an emphasis on personalized approaches driven by molecular insights. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment, aiming for maximal safe resection to obtain tissue for diagnosis and alleviate symptoms. For grade 2 tumors with residual disease but no symptomatic progression, the IDH inhibitor vorasidenib has emerged as a promising option to delay the need for radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. For grade III oligodendrogliomas, postoperative combined-modality therapy with RT and chemotherapy, such as the PCV regimen, demonstrates significant survival benefits, while temozolomide is an alternative due to its ease of administration and reduced toxicity. Recurrent oligodendrogliomas present therapeutic challenges, necessitating tailored strategies based on prior treatments and the interval since initial therapy. Options include repeat surgery, reirradiation, or novel targeted therapies. Advances in molecular diagnostics, such as homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion as a prognostic marker, have refined risk stratification and informed treatment decisions. Despite these strides, further research is needed to optimize long-term outcomes and address resistance mechanisms. This review underscores the importance of integrating molecular diagnostics with clinical management to achieve personalized, evidence-based care for patients with oligodendrogliomas."}

Fusion of VP16 with OCT4 and SOX2 (OvSvK) significantly increases the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation compared to other combinations. The enhanced activities of OCT4 and SOX2 directly facilitated reprogramming by activating downstream targets, some of which are involved in cell cycle regulation. This leads to a shortened G1 phase and a shift in cell cycle dynamics toward an iPSCs-like state. Further analysis reveals that these cell cycle alterations reduced H3K27me3 levels on specific genes, thereby promoting reprogramming. Consistently, knockdown of Ccnd1 and Cdkn2a (siCcnd1, siCdkn2a) as well as overexpression of Ccne1 effectively shortened the G1 phase and enhanced reprogramming efficiency. These findings highlight the role of cell cycle modulation in epigenetic remodeling and provide mechanistic insights for optimization during somatic cell reprogramming."}

This study aims to review the current literature and analyse the association between melanoma and colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as the factors contributing to the development of these SPCs. A scoping review was conducted, including 21 independent studies. Patient data from these studies were analysed and reviewed alongside relevant biological and lifestyle factors. The studies reported standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for a second primary colorectal cancer (CRC) following a melanoma diagnosis ranging from 0.62 to 1.55, while SIRs for a second primary melanoma following a CRC diagnosis ranged from 0.89 to 1.55. Males exhibited a higher risk of developing either CRC or melanoma as a second primary cancer (SPC). An inverse relationship between age and the development of CRC was observed, with younger individuals having a higher risk. African-American populations demonstrated a higher prevalence of melanoma and CRC as SPCs compared to Caucasian and other racial groups. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and the intake of red and processed meats were associated with an increased risk of developing melanoma or CRC. Genetic mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were commonly implicated in the development of both melanoma and CRC, while mutations in CDKN2A and BRCA2 were specifically significant in melanoma. The association between melanoma and CRC incidence was confirmed through analysis of current literature and is influenced by various biological, lifestyle, and genetic factors. Understanding these correlations is crucial for predicting the risk of SPCs and enhancing the follow-up care of melanoma and CRC survivors."}

CDKN2A is located on chromosome 9p21 next to CDKN2B and MTAP and encodes for the protein p16. Various molecular diagnostics are routinely used for assessing the deletion. In this context, we studied a cohort of 40 adult-type gliomas to analyze the concordance of three different molecular techniques, ie, FISH, NGS, and SNP array, for determining CDKN2A status and compared the results to p16 and MTAP immunostainings. The results showed that SNP array is the most reliable technique for the detection of CDKN2A HD and that p16 IHC constitutes a surrogate for the detection of biallelic inactivation of CDKN2A. p16 IHC was more accurate than MTAP IHC in detecting CDKN2A HD because a subset of CDKN2A HD gliomas did not present a deletion of the MTAP gene. IHC also allowed the detection of tumors with a hemizygous deletion of CDKN2A harboring a concomitant second molecular event on the remaining allele, ie, hypermethylation of CDKN2A promoter. We conclude that p16 immunostaining is an accurate biomarker for detecting CDKN2A HD."}

Visual sensitivities are common in autism, but whether differences in the retina might underlie these sensitivities is not well understood. This includes Fragile X syndrome, which is the most common syndromic cause of autism. We explored retinal function in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. We focused on a specific type of retinal neuron homologous with primate ganglion cells, the \"sustained On alpha\" retinal ganglion cell, which plays roles in contrast sensing and binocular vision in mice. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure and dampened responses to light in male Fmr1 knockout mice. We show that decreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E-I balance. The change in E-I balance supports maintenance of circuit excitability similar to what has been observed in cortex. However, this maintenance also reshapes the tuning of this retinal ganglion cell type. These results show that loss of Fmr1 in the mouse retina affects sensory function of one retinal neuron type. As other retinal cell types also express Fmr1, Fragile X syndrome may affect the tuning of retinal cells more broadly. Our findings suggest that the retina may be relevant for understanding visual function in Fragile X syndrome."}

Mice harboring mutations in Fmr1, Cntnap2 or Shank3B show a blunted update of priors during decision-making. Compared with mice that flexibly updated their priors, inflexible updating of priors was associated with a shift in the weighting of prior encoding from sensory to frontal cortices. Furthermore, frontal areas in mouse models of ASD showed more units encoding deviations from the animals' long-run prior, and sensory responses did not differentiate between expected and unexpected observations. These findings suggest that distinct genetic instantiations of ASD may yield common neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes."}

Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes. In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32 years for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs. Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with FMR1 premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2 years, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

Individuals with the FMR1 premutation often exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms before FXTAS onset, leading to the identification of fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). Rodent models of FXTAS show motor impairments, pathological intranuclear inclusions, and heightened anxiety. However, the early onset of neuropsychiatric features and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address the above issues, we used the doxycycline (dox)-inducible 90CGG mouse model, with transgene activation at two developmental stages: adolescence and young adulthood. Mice were evaluated in a behavioural battery to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploration, and motor coordination and learning. Next, we conducted a combination of ex vivo extracellular local field potential recordings to measure synaptic physiology and oscillatory activity in the limbic system, particularly in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vH) regions. Parvalbumin interneurons and intranuclear inclusions in the amygdala and hippocampus were investigated by immunofluorescence, while mass spectrometry and gene set enrichment were used to identify differentially expressed proteins molecular pathways. Adolescent 90CGG mice displayed early-onset hyperactivity, transitioning to heightened anxiety in young adulthood, coinciding with the accumulation of intranuclear inclusions in the BLA and vH. Electrophysiological analysis revealed augmented gamma oscillations in the vH, emerging during adolescence and persisting in young adulthood. These changes correlated with a reduction in parvalbumin interneurons in these regions, and together likely contribute to enhanced BLA excitability and impaired vH plasticity. Finally, proteomic analysis of the vH revealed altered proteins linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adolescence and anxiety/depression in adulthood, aligning well with behavioural findings. Importantly, these behavioural, electrophysiological, and cellular alterations were reversible upon transgene inactivation. This study reveals a temporal progression of CGG premutation effects on behaviour, from hyperactivity to heightened anxiety to late onset motor dysfunction. Moreover, these findings provide altered network activity in the limbic system as a putative mechanism in neuropsychiatric features of premutation carriers."}

Moreover, channel activation promotes the binding of two key mRNA translation regulators, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1), to the channel itself, releasing both from eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), where they normally inhibit initiation of translation.

Survival outcomes from craniotomy and associations with biological features, BRAF mutation status, and PTEN expression were assessed. GSEA found that autophagy signaling pathways are enriched in MBM versus LN and skin metastases. BRAF was the most frequently mutated clinically relevant gene in MBM and ECM, with NRAS and PTEN also frequently altered in MBM. The most strongly upregulated genes in autophagy pathways were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and hemoglobin beta (HBB). An increased proportion of immune-suppressive M2 compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in MBM and ECM was identified.

We investigated whether deep proteomic analyses could be used to diagnose unilateral PA in hypertensive patients. We enrolled 52 patients with unilateral PA and 46 with essential hypertension (EH) and divided them into training and validation cohorts. Plasma samples were collected at baseline from all patients and again from PA patients after adrenalectomy. Deep proteomic analysis was performed to identify peptide signatures used to develop a classification model distinguishing PA from EH in the training cohort. The classification model was subsequently tested in the validation cohort and post-adrenalectomy PA patients. After proteomic analysis, six peptide features including HBB, FIBA, Complement CO7, ALBU, C4BPA, and A2AP were selected to generate risk scores and develop a classification model for distinguishing unilateral PA from EH. Risk scores were significantly higher in PA patients compared to those with EH. The classification model had a sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% and 83.3%, respectively, for diagnosing unilateral PA in the training cohort, and 81.8% and 80.0% in the validation cohort. The model demonstrated strong performance with an area under the curve of .92 for distinguishing hypertensive patients with or without PA. Post-unilateral adrenalectomy, the risk scores showed a significant decrease. Proteomic analysis can identify peptide signatures that effectively distinguish unilateral PA from EH. These findings underscore the potential utility of proteomics as an adjunct diagnostic and monitoring tool in the clinical management of PA."}

However, a common mechanism that correlates the two diseases remains unclear. Here, we have used a bioinformatics approach to understand the molecular network and pathway to predict potentially common genes that can be targeted to prevent these conditions. This study used three online databases and clinical datasets on Gene Expression Omnibus. PPI network analyses, gene-ontology, and pathway analysis were done utilizing advanced bioinformatics tools such as Enrichr, String, and Cytoscape. Furthermore, candidate drug prediction was also performed using DSigDB. Bioinformatic analysis of databases and datasets identified twelve common genes (CXCL8, MMP9, IL1\u03b2, ITGB2, SPP1, PTGS2, SOCS3, BAX, GDF15, S100A8, CCL2, and MYC) in COPD and MASLD. It revealed shared signaling pathways and gene ontology (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions) in both diseases. Five hub genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL1) were also identified, which play a significant role in COPD and MASLD. The study also predicted potential drugs against the common differentially expressed proteins using DSigDB. We performed RT-qPCR to validate the differential expression of the common genes in COPD and MASLD models, which confirmed the in-silico data. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of one of the predicted drug molecules, NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in the COPD and MASLD models, which showed significant inhibition of expression of many upregulated genes, highlighting its potential therapeutic impact. To conclude, data obtained from this study showed key common and hub genes that may be involved in COPD and MASLD pathophysiology and highlight the potential mechanisms underlying their activation."}

Murine CAR agonist 1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) was reported to induce hepatomegaly in mice, accompanied by hepatocyte hypertrophy and proliferation. However, whether CAR activation-induced hepatomegaly is reversible and the histological changes during the reversal process remain elusive. In the current study, C57BL/6 mice were administered TCPOBOP for 5 days and sacrificed at different time points after drug withdrawal. The results showed that TCPOBOP-induced hepatomegaly required a long time to reverse, as evidenced by the liver-to-body weight ratio in the TCPOBOP group remaining significantly higher than that in the vehicle group even 120 days after withdrawal. \u03b2-catenin and cyclin D1 staining indicated a reduction in hepatocyte size and proliferating cells. To investigate the involved mechanisms, we measured proteins associated with hepatomegaly and liver regeneration termination. The results suggested that yes-associated protein, C-MYC, \u03b2-catenin, forkhead box M1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 changed significantly after TCPOBOP withdrawal and functioned at different stages during reversal. Furthermore, we established an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify TCPOBOP concentration. The results indicated a long-term hepatic retention of TCPOBOP, which constantly activated CAR and led to sustained hepatomegaly after TCPOBOP withdrawal. Overall, these findings revealed the reversibility of CAR activation-induced hepatomegaly and provided new insights into the safety of CAR as a drug target. Additionally, the results highlighted the importance of considering long-term TCPOBOP accumulation in the liver to avoid potential adverse effects and experimental biases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrated that hepatic retention of 1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) is the fundamental cause of constant constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation and sustained hepatomegaly after drug withdrawal, which provided new data for the safety of CAR as a drug target and offered novel insights for CAR manipulation on liver diseases. Notably, when using TCPOBOP as a murine CAR agonist, attention should be paid to its hepatic accumulation and retention to avoid potential experimental biases and adverse effects."}

Genetic alterations in SMARCB1, a tumor suppressor gene, have been implicated in poorly differentiated chordomas, but their role in typical and chondroid subtypes remains unclear. This study examined 42 chordoma samples (26 typical, 16 chondroid) for SMARCB1 genetic alterations, expression patterns, and associated pathways. SMARCB1 knockdown experiments were conducted in chordoma cell lines, followed by comprehensive transcriptome analysis. No exonic SMARCB1 mutations were identified, but heterozygous loss was observed in 3/26 typical chordomas. SMARCB1 expression positively correlated with patient survival and epithelial-mesenchymal markers. Functional studies revealed that SMARCB1 knockdown significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated enrichment of MYC targets, E2F targets, and cell cycle pathways in SMARCB1-low samples, while cellular adhesion pathways were downregulated. Notably, SLPI, LBH, and LOXL2 were significantly downregulated in SMARCB1-low samples. SMARCB1 plays an important role in chordoma progression, influencing prognosis and cellular behavior, despite infrequent genetic alterations. Its effects on key oncogenic pathways and cellular plasticity suggest potential for targeted therapies. These findings provide new insights into chordoma biology and lay the groundwork for developing SMARCB1-based prognostic tools and personalized treatment strategies."}

Inhibition of CSCs by natural compounds represents a potential therapeutic approach. Thus, this study aimed to investigate potential effects of glyasperin A (GlyA) against CSCs by regulating possible stemness markers and signaling pathways as well. The NCCIT cell, a cell line derived from extragonadal germ cell tumors, was used as the cancer stem cell model for this study. The growth of teratocarcinoma cells under GlyA treatment in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture patterns was revealed by MTT assay. The flow cytometry analysis was accessed to determine the expression of stemness surface markers and cell cycle arrest. In addition, the immunoblotting and human phospho-kinase array were applied to determine the possible target molecules in NCCIT cells under GlyA intervention. The collected results revealed that GlyA strongly inhibited the growth of NCCIT cells. The compound made cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase. GlyA induced apoptosis by upregulating Bax and phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels. On the other hand, it also downregulated the expression of several transcription factors (Nanog, Oct4, c-Myc), which are closely correlated with stemness. Moreover, the levels of some proteins involved in the Akt/mTOR/IKK signaling pathways, which play critical roles in maintaining the self-renewal and proliferative features of CSCs, were also decreased. These results show that GlyA affects multiple targets that sustain the stemness features and proliferation or cell death of CSCs."}

Sebaceous glands (SGs) produce sebum, which forms a lipid barrier essential for preventing dehydration and defending against oxidative and microbial damage. However, ageing and environmental factors such as UV exposure and pollution impair SG function, leading to skin dryness and loss of radiance. Pterostilbene, a natural antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects, has not been extensively studied for its potential impact on ageing SG cells. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of pterostilbene on SG function under UV-induced damage and its role in collagen repair in UV-exposed fibroblasts. To examine the effects of pterostilbene on UVA-induced damage, an in vitro model of UV-exposed sebocytes was developed. The influence of pterostilbene on lipid synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and gene expression related to senescence and inflammation was assessed. In parallel, the effects of pterostilbene on collagen synthesis (types I and III) and ROS levels in UV-exposed fibroblasts were analysed. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy was utilized to visualize collagen production and F-actin integrity in fibroblasts treated with pterostilbene. Pterostilbene increased lipid synthesis by 16% and reduced ROS levels by 62.43% in UV-damaged sebocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of antioxidant genes (Nrf2, Sirt6) and downregulation of differentiation-related genes (Blimp1, c-Myc). In UV-exposed fibroblasts, pterostilbene significantly enhanced collagen types I and III levels and reduced ROS by 40.07%. High-resolution microscopy showed that pterostilbene restored the distribution of F-actin in fibroblasts affected by UVA. This study demonstrates that pterostilbene effectively protects against UVA-induced damage in both sebocytes and fibroblasts. By promoting lipid synthesis, reducing oxidative stress, and stimulating collagen production, pterostilbene presents a promising natural ingredient for anti-ageing skincare formulations. Its multifunctional mechanisms suggest its potential to enhance skin health by supporting sebaceous gland function and improving overall skin resilience. La peau est le plus grand organe du corps.

Cell viability of LN-229 and U-87MG glioblastoma cells was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Protein and mRNA levels of proliferation and apoptosis-related genes were analyzed via Western blotting and qPCR. Metabolomics and transcriptomics identified key pathways and targets, which were confirmed by in-cell Western blotting and expression correlation analysis. The in vivo antitumor effects of DZN were evaluated in nude mice with LN-229 tumors. DZN treatment reduced cell viability, migration, and survival in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating strong antitumor effects in both in vitro and in vivo models. Multi-omics analysis identified amino acid metabolism and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis as key mechanisms. Bioinformatics highlighted LRP5 as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma. DZN decreased LRP5 activity, downregulated p-GSK-3\u03b2, and promoted c-Myc degradation, thereby inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.

While traditional histopathology plays a key role in LUAD diagnosis, integrating computational pathology with multi-omics analysis provides novel insights into tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics and molecular mechanisms. However, the relationship between pathological histological features and genomic instability in LUAD remains poorly understood. This study employed whole-slide images (WSIs) from the TCGA-LUAD dataset, which were processed into image patches for deep learning feature extraction using ResNet-50 and pathological feature selection using CellProfiler. Copy number variations (CNV) were inferred using inferCNV, and high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) was performed to identify key regulatory modules associated with CNV-defined malignant cell populations. Additional analyses included intercellular communication using CellChat, pseudotime trajectory inference with Monocle2, and immune landscape profiling. Finally, we performed correlation analyses between the gene expression patterns of high-CNV (HCNV) cell lines and pathological image features, followed by prognostic model construction using a machine learning benchmark framework. This study first identified LUAD malignant cells with high CNV scores. These cells also exhibited high stemness, and their proportion gradually increases with the progression of LUAD. CNV-driven tumor subpopulations exhibited distinct metabolic and immune signatures, with HCNV cells showing enhanced glycolysis, MYC signaling, and immune evasion. Intercellular communication analysis highlighted VEGF, MK and IGF signaling pathways as key mediators of HCNV-stroma interactions. A set of 192 imaging features significantly correlated with CNV burden in LUAD was identified, including 11 pathological features from CellProfiler and 181 deep learning features from ResNet-50. Machine learning-based prognostic modeling using deep learning and pathology features demonstrated robust survival prediction, with high-risk patients exhibiting lower immune infiltration and reduced immunotherapy responsiveness. This study provides a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework integrating computational pathology and single-cell multi-omics to characterize LUAD heterogeneity. By identifying CNV-associated imaging features and key molecular regulators, we propose potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targeting in LUAD. However, as this study is based primarily on retrospective bioinformatics analysis, the clinical utility of these findings requires further validation through prospective cohorts and experimental studies. These results lay the groundwork for future translational applications but should be interpreted with caution in the absence of functional validation."}

Potential protein targets of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were predicted using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and SwissTargetPrediction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the edgeR package. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed via STRING, and enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock to estimate PFAS-protein binding energies. PFAS-related targets were associated with dysregulation of key cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, metabolic reprogramming, and DNA repair. Core targets such as CDC20, CCND1, MYC, BIRC5, PTEN, and IL6 were identified across multiple cancers. Molecular docking predicted strong binding energies between PFAS and several of these targets, supporting their potential relevance in cancer-associated molecular processes.

The oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC plays a pivotal role in HCC pathogenesis by regulating key cellular processes, including proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis. Impaired c-MYC regulation strongly correlates with aberrant activation of multiple signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and MAPK/ERK, which collectively drive tumor progression. Furthermore, c-MYC facilitates metabolic reprogramming, enhancing glycolysis and glutamine metabolism to support rapid tumor growth.

After 24 h or 72 h post transfection, the cells were harvested for the following experiments: (i) percentage transfection efficiency, (ii) RNA isolation for qPCR analysis, (iii) immunofluorescence staining, and (iv) protein isolation for Western blotting, respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicate with three biological samples (n = 3). GC-R HTM cells showed significantly higher expression of SMAD4 as compared to GC-NR HTM cells. Similarly, DEX treatment up-regulated the SMAD4-dependent ECM proteins. The presence of a miR-483-3p mimic down-regulated SMAD4 expression and SMAD4-dependent ECM production in a dose-dependent manner by negatively down-regulating SMAD4/TGF-\u03b22 signaling. The inhibition of SMAD4-dependent ECM production by miR-483-3p was more pronounced in GC-R HTM cells as compared to GC-NR cells. The down-regulation in ECM production by miR-483-3p is SMAD4-dependent and may play a protective role in mitigating steroid response in GC-R HTM cells.

We previously identified an atypical canonical BMP signaling in dental mesenchyme that is Smad4-independent but Smad1/5-dependent. This study demonstrates that phosphorylated Smad1/5 (pSmad1/5) and Smad4 regulate distinct gene sets in dental mesenchyme. Real-time monitoring of BMP-Smad transcriptional activity revealed that Smad4-dependent canonical BMP signaling is restricted to neurovascular cells surrounding the condensed dental mesenchymal cells where pSmad1/5 is present. Notably, pSmad1/5 in dental mesenchymal cells form complexes with pSmad3 to prevent canonical BMP signaling. CUT&RUN assays revealed genome-wide co-occupancy of pSmad1/5 and pSmad3, indicating their function as transcriptional regulation units. Integrative analyses demonstrated that this atypical canonical BMP signaling regulates tooth sensory innervation and maintains odontogenic inductive potential in dental mesenchyme, enabling the identification of critical genes for maintaining tooth inductive capability.

Over 300 clinical trials targeting TGF\u03b2 have been conducted in unselected patient cohorts; however, none of the therapies have gained FDA approval. Nevertheless, TGF\u03b2 blockade may hold promise for a subset of cancers with non-functional TGF\u03b2 signaling. Greater than 25% of pancreatic cancers carry mutations in SMAD4, a key component of canonical TGF\u03b2 signaling. In this study, we investigated the potential for stratifying patients based on SMAD4 mutational status to identify tumors susceptible to TGF\u03b2 inhibition. Analysis of SMAD4 expression in human pancreatic tumors revealed that SMAD4 mutation or loss is associated with worse disease-free survival. Intriguingly, intratumoral SMAD4 expression displayed heterogeneity among human pancreatic cancer samples. SMAD4 deficient genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic SMAD4 knockout tumor models exhibited reduced survival, increased metastasis, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment compared to SMAD4 wildtype controls, consistent with gene and protein expression changes in the absence of functional SMAD4. Importantly, treating mice bearing SMAD4 deficient tumors with a blocking TGF\u03b2 antibody reduced tumor weight and improved survival.

However, significant heterogeneity exists in the reported anticancer effects of statins, likely due to variations in statin type (lipophilic vs hydrophilic), dosage, treatment duration, and population-specific characteristics. These factors contribute to inconsistencies in study outcomes. Additionally, while combination therapies incorporating statins with chemotherapy and immunotherapy have demonstrated synergistic effects in certain studies, their clinical utility remains to be fully established.

Recent genome-wide analyses, including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN, and single-cell RNA-seq, have identified key transcription factors that define the transcriptome programs of microglia. Four transcription factors-PU.1, IRF8, SALL1, and SMAD4-form enhancer complexes and act as lineage-determining factors, shaping microglial identity. These factors co-bind with other lineage-determining transcription factors, directing one towards designated regions that program microglia while inhibiting the other from binding to DNA. Other transcription factors, such as BATF3 and MAFB, contribute to transcriptional cascades in microglia. TGF-\u03b2 is a crucial cytokine driving these transcription factors to bind DNA and maintain homeostatic microglia. These findings provide insights into the physiological aspects of microglia and their roles in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. TEASER ABSTRACT: eTOC blurb: In this article, we compiled more than 100 transcription factors expressed in microglia. Our analysis illustrates that some transcription factors are under a distinct hierarchical rank and are sequentially activated to achieve microglia specific transcriptome programs. This article offers a new scope on the mechanistic foundation underlying microglia's complex activity."}

Here, we showed that pre-stimulation of human lung cancer A549 cells with TGF-\u03b2 increases resistance to doxorubicin-induced growth inhibition in a Smad3- and Smad4-dependent manner. This effect was suppressed by the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor oxyfedrine, suggesting that ALDH family members are involved in drug resistance. TGF-\u03b2 upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of ALDH1A1. The TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 transcriptional enhancer region on ALDH1A1 was identified by Smad3 ChIP-seq analysis using an open database and by reporter assays. Knockdown of ALDH1A1 in A549 cells suppressed TGF-\u03b2-induced doxorubicin resistance, and lentivirus-mediated introduction of ALDH1A1 into A549 SMAD3-KO cells restored drug resistance. We also demonstrated that ALDH1A1 is required and sufficient for TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling-induced anchorage-independent growth. The results suggest that the TGF-\u03b2/Smad3/4 axis promotes resistance to doxorubicin and anchorage-independent growth by inducing the transcription of ALDH1A1."}

Despite improvements in understanding the molecular mechanisms and innovations in treatment, the overall survival remains abysmal: fewer than 9 % of patients survive beyond 5 years. By 2030, PC is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. owing to chemoresistance, rapid metastatic spread, and limited effective immunotherapeutic choices. This review highlights current progress in this field, including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic tools, and emerging biomarkers. Recent progress in genetic and molecular profiling has provided important information about pancreatic cancer. It has identified key mutations in genes like KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 that play a major role in driving the disease. Such revelations have provided the impetus to explore novel targeted therapies against these mutations. Furthermore, the advances in liquid biopsies incorporating circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, and exosomes hold substantial promise for early diagnosis, treatment response monitoring, and detection of minimal residual disease-any of which could radically transform PC management. While very limited options for the treatment of advanced-stage PC remain, the only potential curative treatment is surgery, yet only 10-15 % of patients are diagnosed with potentially resectable disease. Researchers are looking into new methods to help more patients qualify for surgery. This involves using chemotherapy and radiotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor before the operation. New chemotherapy treatments like FOLFIRINOX (which includes 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) have improved results for some patients, but they can still cause significant side effects. Immunotherapy, though revolutionary in other cancers, has had limited success in PC due to the tumour's immunosuppressive microenvironment. Researchers are looking into using immune checkpoint inhibitors together with chemotherapy, radiation, and drugs that target the surrounding tissue to improve the body's immune response. There is also considerable excitement surrounding personalised approaches with adoptive cell therapies such as CAR-T cells and TILs, which are trialled with early evidence of potential efficacy. Attempts are also being made to address the dense desmoplastic stroma of the tumour that characterises PC. Drugs that can fight resistance or new medicines that might affect the tumor environment, stop changes in surrounding tissues, and improve how drugs are delivered have shown some potential in laboratory tests so far. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems are also being developed to improve the bioavailability and targeted delivery of chemotherapy."}

Clear gene expression convergences have been found in vocal learning brain regions among several vocal learners, but amino acid convergences remain an open question. Here, we investigated whether avian vocal learning clades have amino acid convergences that could be related to their specialized trait. We developed a tool, Convergent Sequence Variant finder (CSV finder), applied to an alignment of 48 species representing nearly all bird orders, and identified convergent single amino acid variants among vocal learners and among most polyphyletic species combinations. We discovered that the numbers of convergent variants were associated with the product of branch lengths of the most recent common ancestors of each species combination. The number of convergent variants in vocal learning clades did not exceed that of control species combinations. However, a subset of genes with the vocal learner-specific variants was uniquely enriched in the 'learning' process, under positive selection, and supported by meta-analyses for FOXP2 targets, singing-induced regulation, and differential expression in song learning nuclei. Moreover, we confirmed convergent patterns were still enriched in 363 species densely sampled across the avian tree. We propose a hypothesis of a steady state background of amino acid and nucleotide convergence upon which selection acts for convergent traits, with the deeper in time their common ancestor the higher proportions of convergent genetic changes."}

While most PTMCs exhibit indolent growth and a favorable prognosis, some undergo clinical progression with poor outcomes. Thus, identifying biomarkers associated with PTC, particularly those related to PTMC progression, is crucial for precise risk stratification and treatment planning. This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing on 19 surgical tissue specimens from 15 patients, including four para-tumor tissues, four non-progressive PTMCs, five progressive PTMCs, and six progressive PTCs. Key findings are corroborated through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics characterized the cellular ecosystem within PTC, revealing multi-directional evolutionary patterns as PTMC progresses. Analysis of progression-specific alterations in intercellular communication networks highlighted the PROS1-MERTK signaling interaction as pivotal in PTMC progression. In vitro and in vivo models confirm that the PROS1-MERTK axis accelerates PTMC progression via paracrine and autocrine signaling. Furthermore, NFYB and FOXP2 are identified as activators of PROS1 transcription in fibroblasts, promoting PTMC progression through the MERTK/WNT/TGF-\u03b2 signaling. These findings underscore the PROS1/MERTK axis as a critical component of the cellular microenvironment and a key regulatory mechanism in PTMC progression."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "FOXP2", "text": "Vocal learning is a rare, convergent trait that is fundamental to both human speech and birdsong. The Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) transcription factor appears necessary for both types of learned signals, as human mutations in FOXP2 result in speech deficits, and disrupting its expression in zebra finches impairs male-specific song learning. In juvenile and adult male finches, striatal FOXP2 mRNA and protein decline acutely within song-dedicated neurons during singing, indicating that its transcriptional targets are also behaviorally regulated. The identities of these targets in songbirds, and whether they differ across sex, development and/or behavioral conditions, are largely unknown. Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify genomic sites bound by FOXP2 in male and female, juvenile and adult, and singing and non-singing birds. Our results suggest robust FOXP2 binding concentrated in putative promoter regions of genes. The number of genes likely to be bound by FOXP2 varied across conditions, suggesting specialized roles of the candidate targets related to sex, age, and behavioral state. We interrogated these binding targets both bioinformatically, with comparisons to previous studies, and biochemically, with immunohistochemistry using an antibody for a putative target gene. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment for human speech- and language-related functions in males only, consistent with the sexual dimorphism of song learning in this species. Fewer such targets were found in juveniles relative to adults, suggesting an expansion of this regulatory network with maturation. The fewest speech-related targets were found in the singing condition, consistent with the well-documented singing-driven down-regulation of FOXP2 in the songbird striatum. Overall, these data provide an initial catalog of the regulatory landscape of FOXP2 in an avian vocal learner, offering dozens of target genes for future study and providing insight into the molecular underpinnings of vocal learning."}

However, long polyQ tracts are also found in many transcription factors (TFs), such as FOXP2, a TF implicated in human speech. Here, we explore how FOXP2 and other glutamine-rich TFs avoid unscheduled assembly. Throughout interphase, DNA binding, irrespective of sequence specificity, has a solubilizing effect. During mitosis, multiple phosphorylation events promote FOXP2's eviction from chromatin and supplant the solubilizing function of DNA. Further, human-specific amino acid substitutions linked to the evolution of speech map to a mitotic phospho-patch, the \"EVO patch,\" and reduce the propensity of the human FOXP2 to assemble. Fusing the pathogenic form of Huntingtin to either a DNA-binding domain, a phosphomimetic variant of this EVO patch, or a negatively charged peptide is sufficient to diminish assembly formation, suggesting that hijacking mechanisms governing solubility of glutamine-rich TFs may offer new strategies for treatment of polyQ expansion diseases."}

In this study, we used a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset to create a comprehensive profile of the diverse cell types in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord of a mid-thoracic contusion injury model in cynomolgus monkeys. Cell communication analysis indicated that specific signaling events among various dorsal root ganglia cell types occur in response to spinal cord injury. Single-cell analysis using dimensionality reduction clustering identified distinct molecular signatures for nine cell types, including macrophage subpopulations, and differential gene expression profiles between dorsal root ganglia cells and spinal cord cells following spinal cord injury. The macrophage subpopulations were categorized into 11 clusters (MC0-MC10) based on differentially expressed genes, with the top 10 genes being ABCA6, RBMS3, EBF1, LAMA4, ANTXR2, LAMA2, SOX5, FOXP2, GHR, and APOD. MC0, MC1, and MC2 constituted the predominant macrophage populations. MC4, MC6, and MC9 were nearly absent in the spinal cord, but exhibited significant increases in the dorsal root ganglia post-spinal cord injury. Notably, these subpopulations possess a strong capacity for regulating axonal regeneration. The developmental progression of dorsal root ganglia macrophages after spinal cord injury was elucidated using cell trajectory and pseudo-time analyses. Genes such as EBF1 (MC6 and MC9 marker), RBMS3 (MC6 and MC9 marker), and ABCA6 (MC6 marker) showed high expression levels in the critical pathways of macrophage function. Through ligand-receptor pair analysis, we determined that the effects of macrophages on microglia are predominantly mediated through interaction pairs (e.g., SPP1-CD44, LAMC1-CD44, and FN1-CD44), potentially facilitating specific cellular communications within the immune microenvironment. The single-cell RNA sequencing dataset used in this study represents the first comprehensive transcriptional analysis of the dorsal root ganglia after spinal cord injury in cynomolgus monkeys, encompassing nearly all cell types within the dorsal root ganglia region. Using this dataset, we evaluated diverse subtypes of macrophages in the post- spinal cord injury dorsal root ganglia area and examined the signaling pathways that facilitate interactions among immune responserelated macrophages in the dorsal root ganglia. Findings from this study provide a theoretical basis for understanding how the immune microenvironment influences the regenerative capacity of dorsal root ganglia neurons after spinal cord injury and offer novel insights into the complex processes underlying the pathobiology of spinal cord injury."}

However, chromatin accessibility changes in porcine oocytes during growth are unclear. The present study demonstrated that porcine oocytes derived from large follicles (LFO) exhibited higher developmental capacity than those derived from small follicles (SFO). Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis identified 1117 and 1694 uniquely accessible chromatin peaks in LFO and SFO, respectively. Motif analysis of differential peaks revealed the top 10 significantly enriched transcription factor (TF)-binding motifs in LFO versus SFO, with only one increased peak (Spi1 binding site) and nine decreased peaks (NFYA, ATOH1, ZNF549, Foxn1, HAND2, THRB, NHLH2, FoxP1, and FoxP2 binding sites). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis identified key processes in the regulation of oocyte growth and maturation. Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA sequencing data revealed the top 10 hub genes involved in chromatin remodeling (MYSM1 and EZH2), histone modification (MYSM1, RNF2, USP1, EZH2, and MIER1), and transcription regulation (MYSM1, ASXL3, and MIER1), as well as those involved in metabolic processes and signal transduction (DOCK7, FGGY, DTL, and DNAJC6). All these genes exhibited increased expression levels in LFO versus SFO. In conclusion, the study demonstrated the dynamic nature of chromatin accessibility during porcine oocyte growth and revealed the TFs and genes closely associated with oocyte growth and maturation.

We found that all analyzed transcription factors are expressed already during the early fetal period (at 11 PCW).

Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an indolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the repurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to improve outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes evidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG 281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, molecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer provide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies demonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 inhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the response to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and endocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited treatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates precise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies leveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical for refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National Comprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients with hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer."}
{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "NRAS", "text": "Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer, and patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma face limited treatment options due to the lack of direct NRAS inhibitors. This study explores the utilization of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to directly target NRAS-mRNA for therapeutic approaches. We designed and tested NRAS-mRNA-targeting ASOs. Experiments in melanoma cell lines and mouse models assessed effects on cell survival, apoptosis, and tumor growth. A kinase activity profiling platform identified therapeutically exploitable pathways influenced by NRAS suppression. Our research suggests that ASOs do not need to target the mutated NRAS segment to be effective. ASOs designed for the non-mutated NRAS sequence eliminate NRAS-dependent melanoma cells while sparing NRAS wild-type cells. They act independently of subcellular target localization, reduce NRAS-mRNA levels, inhibit MAPK signaling, induce apoptosis, and suppress melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Outcomes of high-throughput kinase activity mapping (HT-KAM) indicate a significant dependency between NRAS-mRNA expression and the activity of MEK1, FGFR2, and CDK4 kinases. Co-targeting these kinases enhances the antiproliferative effect of NRAS ASOs, showing synergy. These findings highlight antisense oligonucleotides as a promising therapeutic approach for NRAS-mutant melanoma. By effectively blocking NRAS-mRNA, this strategy overcomes challenges posed by the absence of a direct small molecule inhibitor for NRAS, and may offer new treatment options for patients. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Some people develop melanoma due to a change (mutation) in their DNA in a gene named NRAS. Changes in NRAS lead to cancer growth by causing a protein called NRAS to be continuously active. These patients have limited effective treatment options. Therefore, we explored a treatment that can prevent cancer cells from producing the NRAS protein. This treatment effectively killed melanoma cells whilst sparing healthy cells and reduced melanoma growth in a mouse model. It also enhanced the effect of other cancer medications. Our treatment strategy demonstrates that these people with melanoma could potentially benefit from similar therapies in the future."}

We sought to evaluate how these mutations contribute to resistance in patients treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with cetuximab, and to explore the impact of treatment duration and disease progression on mutation rates. We retrospectively collected data from 50 mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS who received either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab). Following treatment, tumor samples were recollected through surgery, biopsy, or colonoscopy. The secondary mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF was determined via an amplification refractory mutation system. Based on the nature of the chemotherapy regimen and the presence or absence of tumor progression at the time of the second KRAS mutation analysis, patients were stratified into three groups: Group A (adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence), Group B (first-line chemotherapy without progression), and Group C (first-line chemotherapy with progression). Secondary KRAS mutations were assessed in relation to therapeutic regimens and progression profiles to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The overall rate of secondary KRAS mutations was 6.0% (3/50). These mutations were not observed in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (0/24), but occurred in 11.5% (3/26) of patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab. Stratification by treatment regimens and tumor progression showed mutation rates of 0% (0/13) in Group A, 0% (0/16) in Group B, and 14.3% (3/21) in Group C. In Group C, the mutation rate rose from 0% (0/5) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone to 18.8% (3/16) in those receiving combination therapy. Furthermore, in patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab of Group B and Group C, longer anti-EGFR treatment duration was associated with a higher mutation rate: 5.9% (1/17) in those treated for \u2264 10 months versus 25.0% (2/8) in those treated for > 10 months. Including one case of secondary BRAF mutation, the cumulative mutation rate reached 37.5% (3/8) in patients with prolonged cetuximab exposure.

Disease progression is driven by a complex interplay of genetic alterations, epigenetic dysregulation, and support from the bone marrow microenvironment. Early events such as chromosomal translocations (e.g. t(4;14)), copy number abnormalities (e.g. del(17p), gain(1q)), and driver mutations in KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and DIS3 promote clonal evolution. These are complemented by non-coding regulatory mutations, aberrant splicing, and dysregulated non-coding RNAs that contribute to transcriptional reprogramming. The tumor microenvironment further supports MM progression through cytokine signaling, immune evasion, and enhanced angiogenesis. MM cells also undergo metabolic rewiring, favoring glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism to sustain growth and resist therapy. Epigenetic alterations-including DNA methylation changes, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling-shape gene expression and reinforce malignant behavior.

Survival outcomes from craniotomy and associations with biological features, BRAF mutation status, and PTEN expression were assessed. GSEA found that autophagy signaling pathways are enriched in MBM versus LN and skin metastases. BRAF was the most frequently mutated clinically relevant gene in MBM and ECM, with NRAS and PTEN also frequently altered in MBM. The most strongly upregulated genes in autophagy pathways were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and hemoglobin beta (HBB). An increased proportion of immune-suppressive M2 compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in MBM and ECM was identified.

An inverse relationship between age and the development of CRC was observed, with younger individuals having a higher risk. African-American populations demonstrated a higher prevalence of melanoma and CRC as SPCs compared to Caucasian and other racial groups. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and the intake of red and processed meats were associated with an increased risk of developing melanoma or CRC. Genetic mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were commonly implicated in the development of both melanoma and CRC, while mutations in CDKN2A and BRCA2 were specifically significant in melanoma. The association between melanoma and CRC incidence was confirmed through analysis of current literature and is influenced by various biological, lifestyle, and genetic factors. Understanding these correlations is crucial for predicting the risk of SPCs and enhancing the follow-up care of melanoma and CRC survivors."}

We sought to elucidate the molecular underpinnings and functional implications of miR-425a-5p in the context of myocarditis progression. Bioinformatics techniques were employed to predict NRAS as the target gene of miR-425a-5p. We constructed a cellular myocarditis paradigm through LPS-mediated provocation of AC16 cardiomyocyte cultures. MiR-425a-5p was overexpressed, and the expressions of NRAS, cell apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokine profiles, encompassing IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, were comprehensively quantified. An experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model was created using adeno-associated virus (AAV) for miR-425a-5p overexpression. Comprehensive histopathological analyses were conducted utilizing multiple staining techniques, including hematoxylin-eosin (HE), immunohistochemical, and Masson trichrome methodologies to characterize tissue responses. The study demonstrated that miR-425a-5p alleviated the inflammatory response in both AC16 cells and EAM mice through NRAS mediation. Single-cell data analysis of cardiac immune cells revealed that miR-425a-5p promoted Treg cell differentiation and improved cardiac function. MiR-425a-5p plays a crucial role in modulating inflammatory responses in myocarditis, potentially offering a novel therapeutic strategy for managing the disease."}

The maturity of national veterinary medicine regulatory systems varies between countries across sub-Saharan Africa and immature systems disincentivise manufacturers from bringing products to these markets. Common barriers to regulatory system strengthening identified by national regulatory agencies (NRAs) in the region include lack of financial resources, lack of trained personnel, and a need for suitable IT platforms to enable work-sharing and sharing of confidential data. Greater convergence and harmonisation of regulatory systems would enable more efficient use of resources through facilitation of regional NRA collaborations. Development of internationally agreed standards and guidance on good regulatory practice, a global regulators forum for exchange of best practice, and application of a self-assessment or audit tool, all of which exist for human medicines regulation, would enable NRAs for veterinary medicines to create and implement institutional development plans to achieve system strengthening. Independent assurance of NRA maturity would enhance opportunity for inter-agency reliance or unilateral recognition of regulatory decisions on product authorisation and good manufacturing practice inspection, currently under-utilised pragmatic approaches to ensuring necessary medicines are available quickly."}

Syntaxin4 (STX4) is localized in the plasma membrane and plays a role in the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. To investigate the changes in the biological behavior and effects of STX4 gene silencing on the invasion and metastasis of OC cell lines. The proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of two groups of OC cell lines SK-OV-3 and CAOV-3 constructed with an interfering plasmid (pLVX-shRNA1-STX4-shRNA) and a negative control plasmid (pLVX-shRNA1-nonspecific-shRNA), were examined via Cell Counting Kit-8, Transwell and scratch assays. The EMT markers vimentin and E-cadherin, MMPs (MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9) and CCND1 were used to explore the possible molecular mechanism of STX4 by which STX4 affects OC cells behavior, after which the effect of STX4 gene silencing on the proliferation of OC cells in vivo was tested. After STX4 silencing, the biological behaviors of ovarian cancer cells including proliferation, migration and invasion, were significantly weakened. The results revealed that the E-cadherin, MMP2 and CCND1 levels of both OC cell lines were decreased after STX4 gene silencing. Animal models of STX4 gene silencing showed the tumorigenicity of tumor cells was reduced. We demonstrated for the first time that STX4, an important regulator of OC progression, was associated with the growth and metastasis of OC cells through correlations with EMT, MMP2, and CCND1, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic target for OC."}

Cannabigerol (CBG) appears to be a novel promising compound for managing this increasingly prevalent disease requiring multifaceted pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the herein study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic properties of 2-week CBG administration on the muscular metabolism of sphingolipids as well as insulin signal transduction pathway in a rat model of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) induced by high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) were used to determine the sphingolipids content, while the multiplex assay kit was applied to measure the level of the phosphorylated form of proteins from the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The expression of various proteins engaged in the sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western blotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular content of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced the intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), redirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), respectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, inhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats. These results suggest that CBG may play an essential homeostatic role in skeletal muscles and can protect from the development of obesity-associated metabolic derangements."}

{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "KIT", "text": "Which spermatogonial differentiation states are present in prepubertal testes under normal conditions and following chemotherapy-induced depletion of spermatogonia in paediatric patients with cancer? Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals that only undifferentiated spermatogonia are present in prepubertal boys, while differentiated states emerge during puberty, with reduced protein expression of advanced spermatogonial markers observed in younger patients, those treated with alkylating agents, or those with a diminished spermatogonial pool. Paediatric oncology treatments often involve gonadotoxic therapies that can impair spermatogonial stem cells, increasing the risk of subfertility. While five distinct spermatogonial subpopulations have been identified in adult testes via single-cell RNA sequencing, their presence in prepubertal testes of childhood cancer patients remains to be confirmed through marker protein expression. Gene expression profiles of spermatogonial subpopulations were investigated using single-cell RNA sequencing data from six testicular samples of healthy boys aged 0-17 years. Protein expression patterns were examined via immunofluorescence staining in 14 biobank control samples (median age: 4.9 years; range: 0.6-13.1 years) and in 31 prepubertal testicular tissue samples of paediatric patients with cancer (median age: 6.8 years; range: 0.7-13.1 years). Gene expression profiles of UTF1 (states 0-1), ID4 (states 0-1), PIWIL4 (states 0-1), FGFR3 (states 0-2), and KIT (state 4), were analysed in testicular cells of paediatric origin obtained from our previously published open-access data source (GSE134144 and GSE120508). The protein expression of these spermatogonial subpopulation markers was evaluated by counting immunofluorescence-positive cells per analysed area. Marker expression was correlated with prior chemotherapy exposure and spermatogonia numbers. Exposure to alkylating agents was quantified as the cumulative cyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED), and anthracycline exposure as the cumulative doxorubicin isoequivalent dose equivalents (DIE). A depleted spermatogonia pool was defined as having S/T Z-scores lower than -7 SD. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that germ cells in the prepubertal testis consist solely of undifferentiated spermatogonia. The expression of KIT protein, defining differentiated spermatogonia, was positively correlated with age (P < 0.001). A reduction in the number of spermatogonia expressing ID4 protein was associated with higher CED (P = 0.001), and spermatogonia expressing KIT protein with higher CED and DIE exposure (P = 0.005, and P = 0.035, respectively). A depleted spermatogonia pool (S/T Z-score <-7 SD) correlated with fewer spermatogonia expressing ID4 (P = 0.033), FGFR3 (P = 0.050), and KIT (P = 0.051) proteins. These results indicate that distinct protein expression patterns were observed following chemotherapy-induced reduction of the spermatogonial pool, with reduced expression of ID4, FGFR3, and KIT proteins. Numbers of spermatogonia positive for markers indicating more na\u00efve, undifferentiated states, such as UTF1 and PIWIL4, did not correlate with spermatogonial pool reduction. The study population was heterogeneous in terms of age and treatment exposure. Moreover, the impact of specific cancer treatments could not be individually assessed. Limited tissue availability reduced the statistical power of the study, and repeated double or triple immunofluorescence staining could not be performed. As a result, the correlations between the expression of different spermatogonial markers can only be considered indicative trends. Child testicular control tissue samples were considered normal for inclusion if no testicular pathology was reported. However, detailed information on prior medical treatments or testicular volumes for the patients in this biobank was unavailable. Our observations suggest that alkylating agents have dose-dependent effects on all spermatogonial subpopulations. However, spermatogonial subtypes expressing the protein markers UTF1 and PIWIL4 were more resistant to chemotherapy-induced depletion of the spermatogonial pool, potentially representing true reserve stem cells. The identification of reserve stem cells could provide a valuable method for evaluating the fertility potential of testicular tissue collected for fertility preservation in prepubertal and peripubertal boys.

PC12 cells transfected with ALKBH5 vectors and ALKBH5/Nrf2 siRNAs were treated by LD-LPS, followed by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 and TUNEL assays. Neuronal oxidative stress was evaluated by appraising MDA and SOD levels. ALKBH5 and Nrf2 expression was monitored through immunohistochemistry, Western blot and qRT-PCR. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation assay and Dot-blot experiment were for Nrf2 m6A modification detection, while RNA pull-down assay was for the binding validation between ALKBH5 and Nrf2. In rats with SCI, LD-LPS relieved spinal cord tissue damage and neuronal apoptosis; enhanced neuronal survival; decreased MDA content; elevated SOD activity; down-regulated ALKBH5; up-regulated Nrf2; and facilitated Nrf2 m6A methylation. These above influences by LD-LPS were eliminated by ALKBH5. Similar results were found in the OGD/R-induced PC12 cells after LD-LPS treatment. ALKBH5 significantly blocked Nrf2 m6A methylation, and pulled down Nrf2 protein. In the OGD/R-induced PC12 cells, the repressed oxidative stress and apoptosis by ALKBH5 silencing was abrogated by Nrf2 knockdown. LD-LPS might alleviate neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress after SCI by facilitating Nrf2 m6A methylation via reducing ALKBH5. It was proposed to be a novel strategy for SCI treatment."}

SMAD5 silencing suppressed viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while its overexpression had opposite effects. USP53 deubiquitinated SMAD5 to stabilize its protein expression. Moreover, USP53 knockdown inhibited viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while these effects were reverted by SMAD5 overexpression. EIF4A3 stabilized USP53 mRNA expression, and the inhibitory effect of EIF4A3 silencing on viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was abolished by USP53 overexpression.

The trial was conducted from February 20, 2020, to August 31, 2023. All groups received a TR by a patient navigator to attend clinic-based CCS. In the SC and SC with patient navigation groups, participants were additionally mailed a self-collection kit to their home as an alternative to clinic-based CCS. In the SC with patient navigation group, the mailed kit was followed by a patient navigation telephone call. CCS participation was defined as attendance for clinic-based screening or return of a mailed self-collection kit within 6 months of randomization and determined through electronic health record review.

SLC6A6 expression patterns were mapped using single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A6 with guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES) was applied in corneal wound healing models and murine corneal epithelial stem/progenitor (TKE2) cells. Transcriptomic profiling, RNA/protein analyses, and functional assays were performed in GES-treated TKE2 cells. Aged mice with corneal epithelium scraping received topical taurine supplementation (25 mg/mL, 5 times/day), and the corneas were collected for immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, TKE2 cells were treated with GES along with the Notch1 agonist valproic acid (VPA), or they were treated with taurine along with the Notch1 inhibitor GSI-IX (DAPT). The cornea exhibited high taurine concentrations, with its transporter SLC6A6 predominantly localized in LSPCs (limbal stem cells, transient amplifying cells, and basal cells) and displaying age-dependent expression patterns. SLC6A6 inhibition delayed corneal wound healing, triggered senescence pathway activation and pluripotency suppression, and downregulated stemness markers (BCAM, p63, KRT14, Wnt4) and proliferative markers (Ki67), which recapitulated key features of corneal aging. This functional decline was reversed through topical taurine supplementation. Moreover, VPA effectively reversed the inhibitory effect of GES, whereas DAPT attenuated the effect of taurine, indicating involvement of the Notch1 signaling pathway in taurine-induced LSPC maintenance.

Perturbation of plectin expression and localization leads to the disruption of SSE homeostasis and the involvement in ESCC carcinogenesis. Plectin is involved in maintaining SSE homeostasis, and misexpression of plectin through its genetic alterations or transcriptional dysregulations perturbs the compositions, stoichiometries, and localizations of plectin, HD, DSM, and the cytoskeleton underlying the oncogenic characteristics of plectin."}

Oncogenic mutations in Notch1 occur in up to 75% of T-ALL patients. Although \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) can block Notch1 activation, their clinical application is limited by side effects and reduced sensitivity. Here, a self-assembling, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanotherapeutic strategy-PHD/G-NPs-co-loaded with GSI and controlled released dihydroartemisinin (DHA), and modified with a CD38 antibody is reported. The CD38 antibody specifically targets T-ALL cells, while GSI selectively inhibits Notch1, resulting in a dual-targeting approach. GSI is released first, inhibiting Notch1 activation and inducing the death of a subset of T-ALL cells. To eliminate semi-quiescent T-ALL cells that escape initial therapy by elevating ROS levels, a ROS-sensitive DHA delivery system is employed to enhance ferroptosis and boost GSI efficacy. After elucidating the mechanism of action of PHD/G-NPs in T-ALL cells, PHD/G-NPs are combined with \u03b1PD-1, which triggers an anti-tumor immune response in vivo. This dual-targeting strategy using CD38-modified PHD/G-NPs enables controlled drug release, enhances ferroptosis, mitigates GSI-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, and improves therapeutic efficacy.

Chirality is an essential factor influencing multiple biological processes, including protein interactions, stem cell development and disease pathogenesis. However, its roles in regulating stem cells fate, especially limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs), remain elusive. Herein, it is first discovered that right-handed chiral hydrogel (DH) enhanced LESCs proliferation, migration, and differentiation into corneal epithelial cells, while left-handed chiral hydrogel (LH) can partially preserve LESCs stemness. Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that 3D DH effectively accelerated corneal wound healing process, inhibited both inflammation and vascularization in a partial limbal stem cell deficiency model. Mechanistically, DH activates Notch signaling by increasing its stereo-affinity to Notch1, facilitating Notch intracellular domain release and HES1 transcription, thereby directing LESCs fate. Collectively, this work highlights the novel role of chirality in LESCs fate determination and confirms DH as a drug-free, effective approach for corneal epithelial regeneration, offering a new direction for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering."}

The effects of Xuanfu HT in tumor growth was investigates by mice subcutaneous tumor implantation model. The Xuanfu HT increased sensitivity of HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines with overexpressed HIF-2\u03b1to sorafenib, and enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis by sorafenib. The component quercetin of Xuanfu HT containing serum could inhibit the binding between HIF-2\u03b1 and the promoter of the transcription factor FOXP3 to inhibit the expression of FOXP3, so as to inhibit the activation of Notch1 pathway and angiogenesis. The expression of FOXP3 counteracted the decrease in Notch1 and VEGF expression, and angiogenic capacity induced by the combined treatment with Xuanfu HT and sorafenib.

Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an indolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the repurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to improve outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer. This review synthesizes evidence supporting the repurposing of MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies (endocrine therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) as treatment approaches for low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Trametinib significantly improved progression-free survival in the GOG 281 trial, establishing MEK inhibition as a key therapeutic option. In addition, molecular similarities in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and CDK4/6 pathways between low-grade serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer provide a strong rationale for therapeutic crossover. Endocrine therapies demonstrated efficacy in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with targeted agents to address resistance mechanisms. CDK4/6 inhibitors showed promise by blocking cell cycle progression and enhancing the response to endocrine therapies. In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded clinical benefits in selected patients, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-driven treatment. Repurposing MEK inhibitors and endocrine-based approaches is shaping the treatment landscape for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, particularly in recurrent or advanced cases with limited treatment options. However, the variability in pathway alterations necessitates precise molecular profiling and optimized combination strategies. Future studies leveraging patient-derived models and advanced profiling techniques are critical for refining these approaches. These efforts may help expand National Comprehensive Cancer Network-endorsed options, and provide new hope for patients with hormone-sensitive low-grade serous ovarian cancer."}

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) assisted ultrasound diagnosis system have demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance and the potential to aid in the differentiation of ITNs. This study aims to develop an AI classifier that integrates the AI-assisted ultrasound diagnosis system, FNAC, and demographic data to enhance the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, and to compare the diagnostic performance of the models, with a focus on diagnosing ITNs. In the present research, 620 thyroid nodules were collected from a single medical center and divided into training and testing cohorts (Testing1). We developed five AI models using distinct classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine) that integrate demographic data, cytological findings, and an AI-assisted ultrasound diagnostic system for thyroid nodule assessment. These models underwent prospective validation (Testing2, n = 243) to identify the optimal model. A subsequent prospective study (Testing3) involving 70 thyroid nodules further evaluated the model's performance, where the selected optimal model was compared against FNAC combined with BRAF V600E mutation analysis. After validation with the Testing1 and Testing2 cohorts, the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated the best overall performance among the five classifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) for the RF model to diagnose thyroid nodules was 0.994 in the training cohort, 0.993 in the testing cohort, and 0.977 in the prospective data. In addition, for 42 included ITNs in the prospective data, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the RF model were 90.48%, 89.47%, and 91.30%, respectively.

We retrospectively collected data from 50 mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS who received either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab). Following treatment, tumor samples were recollected through surgery, biopsy, or colonoscopy. The secondary mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF was determined via an amplification refractory mutation system. Based on the nature of the chemotherapy regimen and the presence or absence of tumor progression at the time of the second KRAS mutation analysis, patients were stratified into three groups: Group A (adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence), Group B (first-line chemotherapy without progression), and Group C (first-line chemotherapy with progression). Secondary KRAS mutations were assessed in relation to therapeutic regimens and progression profiles to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The overall rate of secondary KRAS mutations was 6.0% (3/50). These mutations were not observed in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (0/24), but occurred in 11.5% (3/26) of patients receiving chemotherapy combined with cetuximab. Stratification by treatment regimens and tumor progression showed mutation rates of 0% (0/13) in Group A, 0% (0/16) in Group B, and 14.3% (3/21) in Group C. In Group C, the mutation rate rose from 0% (0/5) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone to 18.8% (3/16) in those receiving combination therapy.

Nonetheless, HER2-blocking agents have failed to significantly improve the outcome for OAC patients, despite achieving striking clinical success in breast cancer. To address this conundrum, we investigated how resistance progressively emerges when HER2 is targeted. We discovered that OAC cell lines that are capable of surviving in the presence of the dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib exhibit a significant increase in the protein level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Indeed, NRF2 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effect of lapatinib, while increased NRF2 expression in OAC cells reduced their sensitivity to HER inhibition. Furthermore, prolonged overexpression of NRF2 made OAC cell lines increasingly dependent on NRF2 for growth. Further analyses indicated that the activation of NRF2-mediated transcription that was associated with lapatinib-induced persistent and resistant phenotypes coincided with a subsequent increase in glutathione metabolism. Importantly, lapatinib resistant OAC xenografts become exquisitely sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of the NRF2 pathway.

FuZhengXiaoJi Decoction (FZXJD), a cancer-treating formula, has been successfully applied in NSCLC clinical treatment, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, this paper integrated multiple analytical methods, including network pharmacology, metabolomics, biological approaches, and molecular docking to clarify how FZXJD suppresses NSCLC. This study assessed the anti-NSCLC efficacy of FZXJD using in vitro assays and lung cancer xenograft models, and the primary components and potential mechanisms of FZXJD inhibition of NSCLC were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and network pharmacology. Subsequently, inhibitory mechanisms of FZXJD and its principal effector component oleanolic acid (OA) on NSCLC were explored by molecular docking, as well as biological experiments. Finally, effects of FZXJD on critical metabolic pathways in tumors were further investigated by metabolomics and metabolite enrichment analysis. Inhibition of FZXJD on NSCLC cells was confirmed in vitro experiments. Correspondingly, in vivo experiments revealed that FZXJD impeded tumor progression without obvious toxic side effects. Network pharmacology and molecular docking disclosed that target genes involved in FZXJD's inhibition of NSCLC were significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. Additionally, 14 core genes (HSP90AA1, VEGFA, AKT1, JUN, EGFR, CASP3, ESR1, ERBB2, STAT3, MTOR, SRC, MDM2, CCND1, MAPK3) as well as the main component of the antitumor effect of FZXJD, the OA, were also identified. Biological experiments and molecular docking demonstrated that FZXJD and OA exerted antitumor effects by inhibiting two significant pathways, PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK. Metabolomics analysis indicated that FZXJD treatment suppressed glutathione metabolism in vivo. FZXJD and its main active ingredient, OA, impede NSCLC progression by inhibiting PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. FZXJD treatment also markedly attenuates glutathione metabolism.

In 93 samples from 81 patients with RET+ NSCLC, positive IHC scores were observed for MET in 51 of 86 (59%), ERBB2 in 3 of 84 (3.6%), EGFR in 24 of 84 (29%), HER3 in 31 of 82 (38%), and TROP2 in 59 of 65 (91%). Compared with RET-wt adenocarcinoma (n = 112), RET+ tumors showed higher MET (59% vs 43%; P = .03) and lower ERBB2 expression (3.6% vs 15%; P = .01). The WTS analysis from the independent cohort confirmed these results. Of 61 evaluable samples, 59 of 61 (97%) had at least 1 positive biomarker, 60 of 77 (78%) when excluding TROP2. MET/EGFR coexpression occurred in 17 of 79 evaluable samples (21.5%). Dynamic change in biomarker expression was observed in paired biopsy specimens. No significant survival differences based on target expression emerged in patients treated with RETi in the IHC and the WTS cohorts. The results of this cohort study suggest that RET+ NSCLC tumors frequently express MET and TROP2, with MET positivity enriched vs RET-wt controls. Coexpression and biomarker dynamics highlight the need for membrane target screening and novel therapeutic strategies for this population."}
{"entity_type": "gene", "query": "ERBB2", "text": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), part of the tyrosine kinase family, serves as a key therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer, particularly those with HER2 overexpression. HER2 is overexpressed or amplified in approximately 15-20% of breast cancers. It includes HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4, which progress the growth of cancerous cells. Key signaling pathways involved in HER2-driven breast cancer progression include the MAPK and mTOR pathways, which activate a cascade of factors that promote DNA synthesis and cell growth. A crucial process in HER2 cancer development is HER2 dimerization, which forms a functional oncogenic unit and is followed crucially by HER2:HER3 heterodimerization that leads to downstream signaling pathways. Alterations in the HER2 in solid tumors and ERBB2 gene mutations have led to advancements and implantation of precision-targeted approaches, as well as to combat the issues from the traditional approaches of targeting. In this review, we have thoroughly discussed different HER2-targeting therapies, which include monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, molecular probes targeting by PET/CT imaging, cancer vaccines, and cell therapies like CART-T and CAR-M cell therapy. Some of these targeted therapies have shown effectiveness in managing HER2-positive breast cancer and promoting tumor regression, while some remain under investigation for their potential benefits."}

It is categorized as a refractory condition due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of existing treatments. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative and primary active metabolite of artemisinin, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. To assess the therapeutic effects of DHA on UC and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mouse model (2.5% DSS for 30 days) was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DHA (20 mg/kg/day) through assessment of disease activity, colon damage, and inflammation. Key targets were identified using network pharmacology, followed by pathway analysis (GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG]), molecular docking, and western blotting to validate interactions and signaling modulation. DHA treatment significantly improved disease activity index (DAI) scores, reduced colon shortening, and ameliorated histopathological injury in the DSS-induced UC mouse model. Seven core targets of DHA were identified: EGFR, MMP9, PTGS2, MMP2, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), MAPK1, and ERBB2. Enrichment analyses revealed critical mechanisms and pathways implicated in its therapeutic effects. Molecular docking demonstrated robust binding between DHA and its targets, whereas western blot analysis confirmed that DHA mitigated UC via modulation of the MAPK inflammatory signaling pathway. The research highlights DHA's therapeutic potential in UC treatment by identifying its core targets and mechanisms of action, paving the way for future research and drug development in managing UC."}

Effective and sustainable glycemic control remains elusive, prompting exploration into unconventional sources of metabolic insights. Social insects, in particular bees and ants, exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations enabling them to thrive on carbohydrate-rich diets without developing metabolic disorders typical in humans. This review investigates the bees and ants metabolic strategies to avoid metabolic disorders like diabetes, focusing on their enzymatic pathways such as trehalose metabolism, specialized hormonal regulation involving insulin-like peptides, adipokinetic hormones, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning their metabolic resilience. By systematically comparing these insect adaptations with human metabolic systems, the proposed study identifies potential translational applications, including engineered probiotics, gene-editing approaches, and bioactive compounds for diabetes management. Furthermore, it explores technical, ethical, and ecological considerations for translating insect-derived metabolic mechanisms into human therapies. Highlighting both opportunities and challenges, this review emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research to responsibly integrate nature-inspired solutions into modern diabetes care."}

Liver cirrhosis and cancer are relatively common in MASLD patients. Therefore, it is essential to take proactive measures in preventing its onset or initiating prompt treatment. However, there is a lack of approved medications for effectively treating this ailment. Lipoic acid (LA), a compound with antioxidant, insulin-sensitization, anti-inflammatory, and prooxidant activities, has been proven to inhibit lipid deposition. Many studies have shown that supplementation of LA can alleviate MASLD. Therefore, the latest evidence on the relationship between LA and MASLD is presented in this review. The effect of LA on the accumulation of fat in the liver is emphasized following different diet models (normal, high fat, high fructose, choline deficiency) and other models (gene mutation, diabetes), with the main mechanisms from mitochondrial function to inflammation and oxidative stress being summarized. LA possesses excellent preventive effects on MASLD, which can provide new opportunities for clinical research."}

Gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network linking the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional system integrates endocrine, neural, and immune signals, impacting host metabolism and cognition. The gut microbiota, a critical component of the GBA, significantly impacts gut hormones, neurotransmission, neural development, and other components of gut-brain-axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis facilitates communication via metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) and serotonin. The microbiota influences gut peptide production, including ghrelin, glucagon like pepetide-1 (GLP-1), serotonin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), thereby modulating nutrient absorption and immune responses. Gut hormones such as ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), serotonin (5-HT), neurotensin, peptide YY (PYY) and melatonin play key roles in the GBA. These hormones play several roles including modulation of appetite and satiety, metabolism of nutrients such as lipid and glucose, insulin and glucagon secretion, and influence on gut inflammation, mood, learning and cognition. The interaction between gut microbiota and these hormones underscores their role in maintaining gut-brain homeostasis. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, is linked to altered stress responses, anxiety, and depressive behaviors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of microbiota modulation. Despite the significant roles of gut hormones and microbiota in the GBA, literature on their cellular and molecular mechanisms is limited, and often based on animal models. This review synthesizes current understanding of hormones secreted by the intestine, their physiological effects and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action underlying these effects, with a focus on their roles in the GBA. By elucidating these complex relationships, the review aims to advance research and clinical applications, offering insights into gastrointestinal and systemic health."}
{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "insulin", "text": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are major concerns for surgical patients. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia have been proposed as effective methods for many types of surgeries and are included in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines. However, since total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery does not involve the digestive organs and commonly employs local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain control, do these two interventions still help reduce PONV and pain after joint arthroplasty surgery? This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia on patients undergoing TKA. Data was collected from patient records from June 2022 to April 2024, including 895 patients. Primary outcomes were PONV rates, while secondary outcomes encompassed other short-term postoperative measures (length of hospital stay, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, and postoperative day one range of motion) and adverse events (infection or 30-day readmission rates). Data analyses included independent t-tests for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data. We employed stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of baseline demographic differences between the groups. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia, compared with the control group, did not have a significant effect on PONV. However, we found that the treatment effect varied with body mass index (BMI), showing a significant reduction in PONV in patients who have a BMI \u2265 30. Among secondary outcomes, the intervention significantly reduced pain scores, improved postoperative day one range of motion, and shortened the length of hospital stay. Although the combination of preoperative carbohydrate drinks and multimodal analgesia did not show broad effectiveness in reducing PONV after TKA, it offered significant benefits for obese patients by reducing insulin resistance and decreasing PONV. Additionally, it demonstrated notable effectiveness in pain control, which significantly shortened the length of hospital stay."}

Therefore, the herein study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic properties of 2-week CBG administration on the muscular metabolism of sphingolipids as well as insulin signal transduction pathway in a rat model of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) induced by high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) were used to determine the sphingolipids content, while the multiplex assay kit was applied to measure the level of the phosphorylated form of proteins from the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The expression of various proteins engaged in the sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western blotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular content of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced the intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), redirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), respectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, inhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats. These results suggest that CBG may play an essential homeostatic role in skeletal muscles and can protect from the development of obesity-associated metabolic derangements."}

However, limited research exists on postoperative hypotension in NPC patients undergoing endoscopic surgery. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the risk factors associated with postoperative hypotension in such patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included NPC patients who underwent endoscopic surgery after radiotherapy at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between 2021 and 2023. Patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg were categorized into the hypotension group. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with postoperative hypotension. RESULTS Among 264 patients, 86 (32.5%) experienced postoperative hypotension. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between postoperative hypotension and factors such as sex, height, weight, admission SBP, admission MAP, preoperative hemoglobin level, and preoperative blood calcium level. Multivariate logistic regression identified height [odds ratio (OR): 0.957; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.924-0.991], admission SBP (OR: 0.979; 95% CI: 0.963-0.995), preoperative blood calcium concentration (OR: 0.044; 95% CI: 0.003-0.734), and the use of dexmedetomidine during surgery (OR: 0.278; 95% CI: 0.091-0.848) as independent risk factors for postoperative hypotension. CONCLUSIONS Height, admission SBP, preoperative blood calcium concentration, and the use of dexmedetomidine during surgery were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative hypotension in NPC patients undergoing endoscopic surgery. Identifying and addressing these factors can help clinicians optimize perioperative management by carefully titrating dexmedetomidine doses, ensuring adequate preoperative blood pressure control, and correcting calcium imbalances to maintain hemodynamic stability."}

In a double-blind, randomized control trial, 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned into three groups: Group I was given placebo; Group II curcumin 1100 mg; Group III fenofibrate 160 mg (each administered orally once daily) to ongoing glimepiride 4 mg therapy administered orally once daily for three months. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients aged 35-70 years, those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and those treated with glimepiride 4 mg. Exclusion criteria were as follows: other types of diabetes, pregnancy, abnormal liver or kidney function tests, using other anti-diabetes medications, and non-adherence to medications. At baseline and after three months of intervention, anthropometric measurements were measured, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, hs-CRP, fetuin-A, and sirtuin 1. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for normally distributed data. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank and the Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze non-normally distributed data. Three months after the intervention, when the three groups were compared, no significant differences were found regarding weight, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, two-hour postprandial glucose (2 h-PPG), and HbA1c (p > 0.05). Compared to placebo, significant decreases were observed in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), coronary risk index (CRI), atherogenic index (AI), and hs-CRP and increasing sirtuin 1 in the fenofibrate (p < 0.001) and curcumin (p < 0.05) groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the fenofibrate group were found to be significantly higher than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to curcumin, fenofibrate significantly reduced waist circumferences and fetuin-A and increased sirtuin 1 (p < 0.05). Both fenofibrate and curcumin are effective at decreasing lipid profiles and improving inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes. Fenofibrate might have a superior effect in reducing waist circumference, decreasing fetuin-A, and increasing sirtuin 1.

Specifically, it attained AUC values of 0.8 and 0.765 in the training and test sets, respectively, while achieving accuracy scores of 0.736 and 0.728 in these two datasets. LASSO regression identified key influencing factors, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), age, hemoglobin (Hb), glucose, and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Multivariate linear regression further confirmed the independent associations between these variables and rapid kidney function deterioration (P < 0.05).

This study aims to assess the predictive value of liver enzymes, particularly transaminases, on long-term outcomes in patients with hepatic WD using data from the Spanish Wilson Registry. We analysed data from 162 WD patients with hepatic involvement and over one year of follow-up. Patients were classified as mild (no cirrhosis) or severe (with cirrhosis) at diagnosis. An \"unstable pattern of transaminases\" was defined as recurrent AST or ALT elevations. Unfavourable outcomes included new cirrhosis, elastography progression > 2 Kpa, liver transplant, or liver-related deaths. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact of various factors on disease outcome. Of 162 patients, 81.5% had mild disease at diagnosis. Most received chelators as first-line therapy, achieving an 81.4% one-year biochemical response. After a median follow-up of 17 years, 59% exhibited an unstable transaminase pattern, and 29% had an unfavourable outcome. Key factors associated with poor outcome included older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.03), lack of early biochemical response (OR = 0.19), advanced disease markers (platelet count, albumin), and an unstable transaminase pattern (OR = 2.92). Transaminase levels did not predict outcomes based on initial disease severity. Even patients with mild disease at diagnosis and persistently normal transaminases could experience progression over time, underscoring the need for more thorough follow-up evaluations. While transaminases are valuable for monitoring WD, they should be used alongside other biomarkers to better predict disease progression."}

Pregnant women, as a highly vulnerable population, are frequently exposed to pervasive chiral chemicals that can cross the placenta, with the placenta serving as an enantioselective barrier. Despite significant research on enantioselective transfer of xenobiotics using various models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro), a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of xenobiotics-plasma protein binding remains lacking. This review provides a state-of-the-art synthesis of the characteristics and mechanisms governing the enantioselective transplacental transfer of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial additives-representative chiral xenobiotics of significant public health concern. We highlight how xenobiotics, acting as ligands, interact with proteins, influencing enantioselective transfer through key processes such as plasma protein binding, transporter-mediated biotransport, and enzyme-catalyzed biotransformation. Notably, the binding of xenobiotics to human serum albumin (HSA) rather than \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is shown to primarily inhibit the transmembrane transport of small molecules. Whereas limited docking studies suggest Sudlow site II as a pivotal site for enantioselective binding. Additionally, P-glycoprotein (permeability glycoprotein, P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) are important in determining the enantiomeric distribution between maternal and fetus. Pathological conditions may also modify transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs). Future research employing advanced techniques, such as isotopic tracing, affinity chromatography, high-resolution screening, and machine learning, will be essential to further elucidate enantiomeric transport mechanisms and their implications for fetal development."}

A comprehensive retrospective cohort study was conducted on newly diagnosed PCNSL patients who received HD-MTX chemotherapy. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were collected at diagnosis and prior to each chemotherapy cycle. Serum methotrexate levels were measured at 24-48, 48-72, and 72-96 h post-infusion. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify risk factors for AKI. Among 146 patients with PCNSL, 108 received HD-MTX-based regimens, comprising 576 treatment cycles. Univariate analysis revealed that male gender, serum MTX levels \u22652 \u03bcmol/L at 48-72 h post-infusion, fluid accumulation in third spaces, low serum albumin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine \u22652.0 mg/dL were all associated with increased AKI risk.

This study aimed to investigate the association of the serum Klotho levels with DKD and assess the relationship between serum Klotho and all-cause mortality in individuals with DKD. We utilized data from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), incorporating both cross-sectional and cohort study designs. The association between the serum Klotho and DKD was examined using weighted logistic regression models. To estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality, weighted \u00c7ox proportional hazards models were applied. Restricted cubic spline analysis was used to assess the linear or nonlinear relationships between the serum Klotho and DKD or all-cause mortality. Additionally, mediation analysis was conducted to determine whether the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) mediated the effect of serum Klotho on all-cause mortality. Our findings revealed a significant reverse association between serum Klotho and DKD after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in Model 2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90, P = 0.01). However, this association was attenuated and lost statistical significance after further adjustment for comorbidities, SII, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio in Model 3 (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.32-1.31, P = 0.2). During an average follow-up period of 76 months, a total of 795 individuals (34%) experienced mortality. Weighted multivariate Cox regression models indicated that each one-unit increase in the serum Klotho was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.82, P = 0.008) in DKD patients. Furthermore, restricted cubic spline analysis identified a nonlinear relationship between the serum Klotho and DKD (P for nonlinearity < 0.001), while a linear relationship was observed between serum Klotho and all-cause mortality (P for nonlinearity = 0.3480) among DKD populations. Stratified and interaction analysis confirmed the robustness of these core findings.

Multivariable generalized linear regression and restricted cubic spline models were used to examine the relationships between clinical parameters and sertraline concentrations. The daily dose and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level were positively correlated with the sertraline concentration in both age groups. Sex had a significant effect, with women exhibiting 43% (P = 0.001) and 37% (P = 0.001) higher concentrations than men in the child/adolescent and adult groups, respectively. In children and adolescents, the albumin (Alb) level and neutrophil (NEUT) count also considerably influence concentrations. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) tended to be present at relatively high concentrations, but the difference was not statistically significant. Among child and adolescent patients, significant differences in dose-adjusted serum concentration (C/D) values (P = 0.0291) were observed across different CYP2C19 phenotypes, with PMs exhibiting higher C/D values. In a cohort of 593 patients who underwent high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) testing, a nonlinear, U-shaped correlation between hsCRP levels and sertraline concentrations was identified in children and adolescents. By identifying key factors such as daily dose, sex and AST levels, clinicians can develop tailored treatment plans for individual patients.

Among the myriad of changes driven by age and sex, alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly collagen influence myocardial health in aging. Collagen, the predominant ECM protein, upholds tissue integrity and function through tightly regulated processes. Aging, a significant cardiovascular risk factor, is linked to increased collagen deposition, left ventricular remodelling, and fibrosis. Similarly, sex differences affect cardiovascular disease progression, with notable variations in the deposition of collagen types I and III between males and females. While collagen accumulation is present in aging in both sexes, females exhibit a tempered response until menopause, primarily due to oestrogen-mediated suppression of excessive collagen remodelling. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying age- and sex-related changes in cardiac collagen metabolism and their implications for myocardial health. Aging-associated fibrosis and collagen accumulation appear mechanistically distinct from those seen with injury or dysfunction, occurring without increased collagen synthesis despite elevated degradation enzymes. Factors such as senescence, inflammation, oxidative stress, and enhanced ECM crosslinking are identified as key drivers of these metabolic shifts. While studies in ovariectomized rodent models have highlighted the role of sex in collagen metabolism, evidence suggests that aging exerts a more dominant influence overall. Additionally, this review emphasizes a critical gap in the field: the limited availability of longitudinal aging fibrosis studies that include both sexes. This scarcity hampers a comprehensive understanding of how aging and sex collectively shape collagen turnover and myocardial health. By assessing these knowledge gaps, the review aims to define current perspectives and may provide insights to help inform the development of more effective, targeted therapeutic approaches."}

Collagen I, a key scaffolding material in bodily tissues, presents challenges in controlling its assembly kinetics in a biocompatible manner in vitro, restricting its use as a primary scaffold or adhesive in cellular biofabrication. Here we report a collagen fabrication method termed as tunable rapid assembly of collagenous elements that leverages macromolecular crowding to achieve the instant assembly of unmodified collagen. By applying an inert crowder to accelerate the liquid-gel transition of collagen, our method enables the high-throughput creation of physiological collagen constructs across length scales-from micro to macro-and facilitates cell self-assembly and morphogenesis through the generation of tunable multiscale architectural cues. With high biocompatibility and rapid gelation kinetics, the tunable rapid assembly of collagenous elements method also offers a versatile bioprinting approach for collagen over a wide concentration range, enabling the direct printing of cellular tissues using pH-neutral, bioactive collagen bioinks and achieving both structural complexity and biofunctionality. This work broadens the scope of controllable multiscale biofabrication for tissues across various organ systems using unmodified collagen."}

To assess IL-35 (P35 and Ebi3 subunits) and IL-37 gene expression, along with the serum levels of IL-35 protein in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. Cytokine gene expression was measured using the qRT-PCR technique, while IL-35 serum levels were measured using the ELISA method. The data obtained were analyzed using a Bayesian regression model in the R software. The results revealed that the expression of P35 gene, of the two subunits of IL-35, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, Ebi3 and IL-37 transcript levels were significantly lower in patients compared to healthy individuals (p<0.001). In contrast, IL-35 serum level in patients showed a significant increase compared to the control group (p=0.016). Notably, IL-37 expression showed a negative correlation with age (p=0.004). . We also observed positive and significant correlations between the gene expression of P35 and Ebi3 (p= 0.02, r= 0.4), P35 and IL-37 (p= 0.008, r= 0.45), and Ebi3 and IL-37 (p= 0.016, r= 0.41). In conclusion, our study revealed a higher serum protein level of IL-35 in PD patients compared to the healthy control group. Meanwhile, gene expression levels of IL-37 and Ebi-3 were significantly reduced. These alterations in the expression of these cytokines are suggested to be partly responsible for the immune system dysregulation in this disease."}

The occlusion of blood-supporting vessels by thrombus or emboli can contribute to massive brain cell damage, neurological deficits, and long-term disability, and in more severe conditions, results in sudden death. Current therapeutic strategies, along with rehabilitation, in part, but not completely, can restore the integrity and function of the brain. These features necessitate the advent of novel therapeutic protocols for yielding better regenerative outcomes in IS patients. In past decades, the discovery of stem cells and byproducts has led to promising results in in vitro settings and pre-clinical studies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles released from various cell types, for instance, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with certain signaling biomolecules, growth factors, and cytokines involved in cell-to-cell communication. A great plethora of studies have pointed to the fact that EVs with specific cargo can distribute easily in different parts of the body, making them appropriate therapeutics under different pathological conditions. The current review articles aimed to highlight the neuroangiogenesis properties of MSC EVs in IS conditions. How and by which mechanisms MSC EVs can orchestrate the process of nervous system regeneration is at the center of debate. We think that the current article can help us better understand MSC EVs' function in the restoration of brain function under IS conditions in terms of neurogenesis and angiogenesis."}

To date there is increasing number of reports on the lung pathology of fatal COVID-19 and the results are mainly obtained by autopsies of elderly patients, since this age group shows highest mortality. Little is known about the progression of the disease in children and especially newborn and infants and, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the lung features of fatal COVID-19 in this age group. In the present case study, we have investigated the lung morphological features in 11-months old infant who has died as a result of complications from COVID-19. Immunohistochemistry for immune cell markers and transmission electron microscopy for alveolocytes type II (ATII) are made. Immediate cause of the death was acute respiratory failure resulting from bilateral interstitial pneumonia and subsequent acute cardiovascular failure. The histopathology shows lung edema, hyaline membranes, airway mucus plugging and interstitial inflammation. On cellular level we have observed a substantial increase in the number of ATII cells. ATII cells were marked with cytokeratin 19, TTF1 and napsin A. Transmission elec-tron microscopy reveals ongoing apoptosis in these cells with a typical chromatin clustering and condensation towards the inner nuclear membrane. Immunohisto-chemistry shows significant increase of CD68+ macro-phages in the alveoli, increase of IL-6 in immune and stromal cells, moderate elevation of FOXP3+ and IL-17+ cells and expression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in alveolar walls. Immune cell interactions are discussed in the sense of ongoing cytokine storm.

A mouse model of RIOM was established with varying irradiation doses. Tongue tissues were analyzed via histological staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. In vitro, keratinocytes were irradiated and treated with RIPK3 or MLKL inhibitors. Subsequently, cell viability, necroptosis, and inflammatory cytokine expression were assessed using CCK-8, LDH release, Western blot, flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. In irradiated mouse tongues, p-RIPK3/RIPK3 and p-MLKL/MLKL ratios were significantly elevated (P < 0.01), accompanied by heightened expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Similar findings were observed in keratinocytes, which, after 12 Gy irradiation for 2.5 days, reduced cell viability (P < 0.001), enhanced necroptotic marker expression (P < 0.001), and increased inflammatory cytokine levels (P < 0.001). Furthermore, treatment with RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 or MLKL inhibitor GW806742X significantly reduced irradiation-induced keratinocyte cell death (P < 0.001), LDH release (P < 0.001) and the expression of inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.01).

A total of 128 children 3-14 years of age with MPP who underwent bronchoscopy at Jingmen Central Hospital, China, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 were enrolled. Patients were divided into a PB and a non-PB group based on bronchoscopy findings. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, including BALF cytokine levels, were compared. A risk prediction nomogram for PB was constructed and evaluated. Of 128 children with MPP, 40 (31%) had PB. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that clinically severe MPP (OR = 8.78; P = 0.002), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (OR = 2.78; P = 0.049) and elevated BALF interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR = 1.01; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for PB.

Mice were fed a standard diet or HFD for 12 weeks (long-term) or 1 week (short-term), and the stomachs were then examined. Additionally, corpus specimens from patients with obesity, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and normal human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1) were studied. FGF23 production was examined by qPCR and Western blotting, mucosal integrity assessed by fluorescence microscopy, and FGF23-expressing cells analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In mice, HFD feeding up-regulated Fgf23 expression and FGF23 protein abundance in the proximal glandular stomach. FGF23-positive cells were detected in damaged glandular and interglandular areas representing mucus-like cells, endothelial cells of interconnected blood vessels or stromal endothelial cells and myofibroblasts. FGF23 expression was associated with impaired tissue integrity, immune cell infiltration and lipid deposition, with less pronounced mucosal changes upon short-term HFD feeding. Gastric FGF23 was also detectable in patients with obesity, mainly in endothelial cells of dilated and interconnected vessels. In HUVECs, pro-angiogenic adipokine leptin ramped up FGF23 transcript levels. In GES-1 cells, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) tended to enhance FGF23 expression.

Our small RNA sequencing analysis identified microRNA (miR)-100-5p as a potential target. Adult male Balb/c mice were then randomly assigned to the IMQ, IMQ plus MSC-exosomes (IMQ + Exo), IMQ plus MSC-exosomes treated with a specific miR-100-5p inhibitor (IMQ + Exoi), or IMQ plus agomiR-100-5p group (IMQ + AgomiR) (n = 6 per group). Control groups were also included. Mice were sacrificed, and psoriasis severity was assessed the day after 6 consecutive days of daily IMQ exposure, followed by 7 consecutive days of daily treatment. The IMQ + Exo group exhibited significantly lower epidermal thickness, levels of inflammatory cytokines and psoriasis-related cytokines (interleukin [IL]-12, IL-17, and IL-23), and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (the predicted downstream target of miR-100-5p), compared to the IMQ group (all p < 0.05). Notably, inhibition of miR-100-5p nullified these therapeutic effects of MSC-exosomes.

The aim of this study is to develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for risk stratification of suspected NSTE-ACS patients and to compare its performance with currently available prehospital diagnostic tools. For this study, an internal training cohort and an external validation cohort were used, both consisting of suspected NSTE-ACS patients. A CNN (ECG interpretation by CNN (ECG-AI)) was trained and validated to detect NSTE-ACS. The diagnostic value of ECG-AI in detecting NSTE-ACS was compared with on-site ECG analyses by an EMS paramedic (ECG-EMS), point-of-care troponin assessment and a validated prehospital clinical risk score (prehospital History, ECG, Age, Risk factors and POC-troponin (preHEART)). A total of 5645 patients suspected of NSTE-ACS were included. In the external validation cohort (n=754), 27% were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS. ECG-AI had a better diagnostic performance than ECG-EMS (area under the curve (AUROC) 0.70 (0.66 to 0.74) vs AUROC 0.65 (0.61 to 0.70), p=0.045) for diagnosing NSTE-ACS. The overall diagnostic accuracy of preHEART was AUROC 0.78 (0.74 to 0.82) and superior compared with ECG-AI (p=0.001). Incorporating ECG-AI into preHEART led to a significant improvement in diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.83 (0.79 to 0.86), p<0.001). Correctly identifying patients who are at low risk for having NSTE-ACS is crucial for optimal triage in the prehospital setting. Recent studies have shown that these low-risk patients could potentially be left at home or transferred to a general practitioner, leading to less emergency department overcrowding and lower healthcare costs. Other studies demonstrated better overall diagnostic performance compared with our artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, these studies were aimed at a study population with a high prevalence of occlusive myocardial infarction, which could explain the differing levels of diagnostic performance. Integrating AI in prehospital ECG interpretation improves the identification of patients at low risk for having NSTE-ACS.

Whole-mount megablock cross-sectional analysis was performed with cardiac troponin, MYL4, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's Trichrome, pro-ANP, and GJA5 colocalization. Comparative transcriptomics from human hearts (N = 10) identified myosin light chain 4 (MYL4) as a promising human PF marker for distinguishing conductive from contractile myocardium. Using PF-rich bundle branch and subendocardial regions, MYL4 specificity was validated using canonical PF markers in human (n = 3), dog (n = 3), goat (n = 3), and pig (n = 3) hearts. Cross-sectional histology of the entire human ventricular myocardium uncovered a deep-seated network of transmurally intercalated, MYL4-positive PFs.

Only 12 (32%) patients fulfilled both of the main LLC (i.e., non-ischemic myocardial injury/edema with elevated T1 values or presence of late gadolinium enhancement and myocardial edema detected by increased T2 values or positive T2-STIR), resulting in a sensitivity of 32% (20-49%) and specificity of 100% (87-100%). Among controls, 6 (24%) patients had elevated native T1 values, but all had normal T2. In patients with suspected myocarditis due to autoimmune rheumatic disease, who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the Lake Louise Criteria have a high specificity, but a lower sensitivity than in patients with viral myocarditis. Additional tests should therefore be used to improve disease detection in this population. Where the pre-test probability is high, in patients with suspected myocarditis due to autoimmune rheumatic disease who are undergoing immunosuppression, there may need to be greater reliance on one T1-based criterion rather than both LLC, with the recognition that there is an appreciable rate of raised T1 in controls without myocarditis."}

This review explores how IR promotes amyloidogenesis by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis and enhancing Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) production and aggregation. Specifically, we examine the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in cholesterol homeostasis along with their impact on insulin signaling pathways, highlights how their dysregulation can lead to IR, a significant contributor to the development of amyloidogenesis, a key factor in causing NDDs. We explore the novel molecular mechanisms linking IR and A\u03b2 aggregation, focusing on the interplay between ABC transporters and Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Furthermore, we also explore emerging evidence linking ABC transporters to oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction critical factors in the development of amyloidogenesis. Additionally, this review also discusses potential therapeutic strategies targeting ABC transporters to mitigate IR and reduce amyloid burden by various mechanisms including Insulin receptors/IRS-1 signaling, Phosphatidylinositol3kinase-Protein kinase-B (PI3K/AKT), Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE), Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), Glucose transporters (GLUTs), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), Adiponectin, Mitochondrial dysfunctioning, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) Wingless-related integration site/beta-catenin (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin) and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1).

Brain MRI images were processed through Freesurfer to compute disease-related regions-of-interest (ROIs) for AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Cognitive performance was assessed in memory and executive functioning (EF) domains. Five boxers had follow-up measurements after ~ 7 years. Former boxers had higher plasma GFAP, p-tau181 and p-tau217 than patients with SCD, lower volumes in all pre-specified disease-related brain regions. No differences on neuropsychological test scores between boxers and those with SCD were observed. Longitudinal analysis in the boxer group demonstrated elevation of plasma NfL and p-tau181 over time.

Fragments of A\u03b225-35 were administered to SH-SY5Y cells in order to simulate the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT test. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the expression levels of linc00968 were examined in treated and untreated (control) cells exposed to A\u03b225-35. Subsequently, linc00968 was transfected with siRNA into A\u03b225-35-treated SH-SY5Y cells to silence its expression and confirmed by qRT-PCR. The impact of BCL-2, BAX, CYT-C, and the internal control gene GAPDH on apoptotic pathways was examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To assess the post-transcriptional effects, the levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-c, and Beta-actin were analyzed using western blotting. The expression of Linc00968 was observed to be elevated in A\u03b2 25-35 stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. A\u03b225-35-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells led to a reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2, while the expressions of the pro-apoptotic genes BAX and CYT-C were found to be elevated.

We previously showed that tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS/YARS1) is reduced in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains, and tyrosine and phenylalanine decrease TyrRS in neurons. Here, we found that tau is a negative regulator, whereas estrogen and leucine act as positive regulators of TyrRS. Young female mice exhibit increased TyrRS in the cortex compared to male mice. Notably, young Tau knockout male, but not female mice showed increased cortical TyrRS. Tau accumulation in middle-aged female mice did not decrease cortical TyrRS compared to males, suggesting that middle-aged females are resilient to tau-mediated TyrRS depletion. Tyrosine and phenylalanine treatment decreased tubulin tyrosination, activated DNA repair pathways, and protected against etoposide (ETO) and camptothecin (CPT)-induced toxicity, respectively, in neurons. While tyrosine facilitated topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) recruitment to chromatin and inhibited global transcription, in contrast, phenylalanine recruited topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2\u03b2) to chromatin and stimulated global transcription. Furthermore, tyrosine decreased the presence of DNA fragments in a comet assay whereas phenylalanine increased them. Addition of cis-resveratrol (cis-RSV) protected against tyrosine-induced transcription inhibition by facilitating the recruitment of both TOP1 and TOP2\u03b2 to chromatin and increasing tubulin tyrosination. Moreover, cis-RSV decreased both total and phosphorylated tau and protected neurons against amyloid beta (A\u03b2)-induced neurite degeneration and DNA damage. Gene expression profiling using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons demonstrated that cis-RSV is a broad-spectrum neuroprotective and anti-viral agent. In contrast, trans-RSV mimics phenylalanine-induced gene expression, including downregulation of long genes and induction of an AD-like gene expression signature. This work suggests that age and disease-associated increases in serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels would activate neuronal DNA repair while inhibiting transcription and tubulin tyrosination. cis-RSV protects against their toxicity by restoring tubulin tyrosination, TOP1 and TOP2\u03b2-mediated transcription, and decreasing tau in primary neurons."}

The difference between the two groups was not significant with respect to cognitive outcomes (Chi-square = 0.08, df = 2, N = 250, p = 0.96). However, rivastigmine was associated with a higher rate of side effects (65, or 52%), which could hinder adherence. Both groups had an average of 1.48 hospitalization episodes per patient. Biomarker analysis suggested that 144 (57.6%) of patients tested positive for amyloid on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis data, illustrated through mean values, showed amyloid beta at 546.38 pg/mL and tau at 219.85 pg/mL - both linked to cognitive decline. Higher levels of tau were significantly correlated with greater cognitive decline. Statistically, there were significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of MMSE scores and CSF biomarkers (p < 0.05).

Through a guinea-pig animal model, subjected to either normoxic-normobaric or HAH conditions (groups N and H, respectively), biaxial tensile and uniaxial stress relaxation tests were performed on artery samples. The experimental data obtained from these biomechanical tests allowed us to characterize an anisotropic quasi-linear viscoelastic model based on the Gasser-Holzapfel-Ogden (GHO) hyperelastic material. Among the main results, biaxial tensile tests exhibited a trend towards a higher stiffness (at high stretch levels) in the hypoxic group.

A novel application of skin biopsy is introduced as a tissue-level surrogate for aortic wall integrity. Histological and transmission electron microscopy analyses were used to identify gradable ultrastructural features of collagen and elastin organization. The AAVS framework defines three biological risk domains, substrate vulnerability, clinical fragility, and mechanisms of failure, each linked to a proposed scoring system under development. Clinical case illustrations demonstrate conceptual utility. The three domains of biological risk are (1) substrate vulnerability, assessed through the AAVS Score of histological; and ultrastructural analysis of skin biopsy as a surrogate for aortic tissue integrity; (2) clinical fragility, captured by the Vascular Fragility Score, which quantifies phenotypic indicators of vascular fragility from clinical history, physical findings, and imaging; and (3) mechanisms of failure, modeled by substrate vulnerability progression, a longitudinal, dynamic modeling system that tracks substrate vulnerability progression over time toward aortic failure and includes vascular health modifiers that alter mismatch progression over time. AAVS introduces a structured clinical reasoning framework and skin biopsy-based scoring approach for risk stratification in aortopathy and arteriopathy. It reframes failure as a progressive biological process shaped by substrate integrity, not just anatomy or procedural success.

By Day 28, Collagen I and III densities and organization significantly improved, with the Collagen I/III ratio rising to 7.05 \u00b1 1.21 in the treatment area (p < 0.01) and 3.90 \u00b1 0.37 in the surrounding dermis (p < 0.001). Elastic fibers also showed increased density. mIHC staining demonstrated significant upregulation of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 expression in treated and surrounding dermal regions by Day 7 (p < 0.01); however, by Day 28, MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expression significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas MMP-3 remained elevated. Furthermore, expression levels of TGF-\u03b2, EGF, and Ki67 significantly increased by Day 28 (p < 0.05). mIHC analysis of the fibroblast marker FSP-1 coexpression, along with Western blot analysis of Collagen I, Collagen III, MMP-1, MMP-3, TGF-\u03b2, and EGF, revealed similar trends. Notably, significant expression of ADSC markers was detected at Day 7 posttreatment (p < 0.01). MRF predominantly promotes the synthesis of Collagen I and Collagen III, increasing the Collagen I/III ratio, and regulates the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, TGF-\u03b2, and EGF. These factors collectively drive fibroblast activation, migration, and ECM remodeling. These changes are indicative of the potential for MRF to support skin regeneration and rejuvenation. Preliminary findings suggest that ADSCs may contribute to these regenerative processes."}

However, the mechanisms that sustain CSCs in CRC remain unclear. This study aimed to identify and characterize gene expressions associated with CRC stemness. We applied a 1-class logistic regression machine learning model to calculate the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) for CRC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and cBioPortal databases, adjusting the mRNAsi by tumor purity. Clinical features of CRC were considered in assessing both mRNAsi and adjusted mRNAsi levels. Using DESeq2, we screened differentially expressed genes between high and low mRNAsi groups. Enrichment analysis provided functional annotation for these differentially expressed genes. Key genes linked to mRNAsi were identified using the Kaplan-Meier plotter and Cytoscape software, followed by an evaluation of their prognostic significance. Potential small-molecule compounds targeting the CRC stemness signature were explored via L1000FWD, DGIdb, and CMap databases. CRC samples with higher mRNAsi or adjusted mRNAsi values showed improved disease-free survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Strong correlation between clinical characteristics of CSCs and mRNAsi was observed; CMS4 subtype CRC patients had lower mRNAsi with worse DSS and PFS. Ten key genes associated with mRNAsi were identified: collagen type I alpha 1, fibrillin 1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, SPP1, BGN, COL5A1, FN1, elastin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, collagen type I alpha 2. Lower expression of these genes correlated with better PFS and DSS. High correlation among these genes was confirmed in the protein-protein interaction network. This study identifies potential small-molecule drugs targeting stemness in CRC and highlights the prognostic value of the 10 key genes, offering insights into therapeutic targets for CRC treatment."}

The majority of the BMD biomarker studies employ targeted approaches and focus on translating findings from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a more severe disease form with clinical similarities but caused by out-of-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene. Importantly, DMD therapies assume that disease progression can be slowed by promoting the expression of truncated dystrophin comparable to what occurs in BMD patients. In this study, we explore similarities and differences in protein trajectories over time between BMD and DMD serum, and explore proteins related to motor function performance. Serum samples collected from 34 BMD patients, in a prospective longitudinal 3-year study, and 19 DMD patients, were analyzed by using Data Independent Acquisition Tandem Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS). Subsequent normalization, linear mixed effects model was employed to identify proteins associated with physical tests and dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. Analysis was also performed to explore the discrepancy between DMD and BMD biomarker abundance trajectories over time. Linear mixed effects models identified 20 proteins with altered longitudinal signatures between DMD and BMD, including creatine kinase M-type (CKM) pyruvate kinase (PKM), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M). Furthermore, several proteins related to innate immune response were associated with motor function in BMD patients. In particular, A2M displayed an altered time-dependent decline in relation to dystrophin expression in the tibialis anterior muscle. Our study revealed differences in the serum proteome between BMD and DMD, which comprises proteins involved in the immune response, extracellular matrix organization and hemostasis but not muscle leakage proteins significantly associated with disease progression in DMD. If further evaluated and validated, these biomarker candidates may offer means to monitor disease progression in BMD patients. A2M is of particular interest due to its association with dystrophin expression in BMD muscle and higher abundance in DMD patients in comparison to BMD. If validated, A2M could be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in therapeutic clinical trials aiming to restore dystrophin expression."}

Significant platelet hypofunction was detected in this cohort of severely injured trauma patients at time of presentation, with 70 % of patients having hypofunction in at least one Multiplate\u00ae channel. The median ASPI area under the curve and 95 % confidence interval were below the lower reference range, indicating this population had reduced platelet function. In patients with deranged platelet function, significantly lower platelet count (p \u2264 0.001), EXTEM amplitude at five minutes (A5) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) (p = 0.001, p \u2264 0.001), and PLTEM A5 and MCF (p = 0.005, p = 0.003) were identified compared to patients with normal platelet function. A significant improvement in platelet function parameters was not observed following platelet transfusion. Platelet hypofunction is common in severely injured trauma patients. This was true both before and after platelet transfusion, suggesting trauma precipitates alteration of the vascular circulating milieu in a way that impairs platelet function.

The included reviews examined: (1) diagnostic accuracy of tools during vaginal birth, (2) implementation strategies for WHO guidelines, (3) transfusion of blood and blood products, and (4) intraoperative cell salvage during cesarean delivery. Calibrated blood loss tools combined with clinical observation demonstrated superior performance compared to visual estimation, with pooled sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95%. Multicomponent strategies modestly improved adherence to WHO-recommended practices, yet had limited impact on maternal mortality and ICU admissions. Evidence regarding transfusion thresholds, fibrinogen concentrate, and cryoprecipitate was of low certainty and inconclusive. Intraoperative cell salvage showed potential benefits, including a reduction in total blood loss (mean difference -113.6 mL) and a modest increase in postpartum hemoglobin (mean difference +6.14 g/L), although the overall quality of evidence remains low. This review underscores the value of objective measurement tools and structured implementation efforts in improving PPH care.

The univariate and multivariable logistic regression were utilized to identify independent risk factors linked to one-year mortality. A predictive nomogram was subsequently developed. The discriminatory power of the model and its accuracy were monitored by utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Furthermore, visual risk applications were developed to enhance usability. The one-year mortality is 16.8%. A total of seven predictors, namely age, body mass index (BMI), fibrinogen (FIB), stroke, dementia, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists), intraoperative blood transfusion were identified by multivariate analysis from a total of 65 variables studied. The model constructed using these seven predictors displayed medium prediction ability, with an area under the ROC of 0.775 in the training set and 0.740 in the validation set. The calibration curve shows a good degree of fitting between the predicted and observed probabilities. The DCA curve showed that the nomogram could be applied clinically if the risk threshold was between 8 and 64%, which was found to be between 6 and 80% in the external validation.

Microglial activation and polarization exhibit a dual nature, mediating both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects. Fibrinogen, as a potent pro-inflammatory mediator, interacts with microglia and is implicated in the progression of various neurological conditions. This study investigates the effects of fibrinogen and the exogenous STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone on primary microglial function. Primary microglial cells were isolated from neonatal C57BL/6 mice and subsequently treated with fibrinogen and the STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone. Inflammatory marker expression was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while protein levels of JAK2 and STAT3 were determined using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Fibrinogen exposure upregulated STAT3 and JAK2 phosphorylation in primary microglial cells. Cryptotanshinone treatment effectively attenuated STAT3 phosphorylation while concurrently downregulating JAK2 activation. Furthermore, fibrinogen significantly enhanced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, while the transcription levels of TGF-\u03b2 remained unchanged. This study demonstrates that fibrinogen stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary microglial cells by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings provide mechanistic insights into fibrinogen-induced neuroinflammation and suggest potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases."}

Mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex pipiens biotype molestus) were fed on Borrelia-infected mice to assess pathogen acquisition. Additional experiments involved ex vivo feeding on Borrelia-enriched blood to examine spirochete persistence in the mosquito gut.

The expression of YTHDF1 was investigated by bioinformatics analysis and skin lesions of AD patients. The functional role and upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms of YTHDF1 were examined through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of YTHDF1 in the AD mouse model was evaluated for its therapeutic potential. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the YTHDF1 mRNA level in the skin lesions of AD was significantly higher than that in healthy people. YTHDF1 expression was significantly elevated in AD skin lesions, the DNCB-induced AD mouse model, and primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells stimulated with interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, compared to controls. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that upregulation of YTHDF1 in AD exacerbated cell proliferation and inhibited keratinization by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was modulated via the IL-4/IL-13/STAT3 axis. Moreover, topical application of AAV-YTHDF1 significantly improved AD-like lesions in the mouse model. This study identifies YTHDF1 as a contributor to AD pathogenesis by influencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. It also suggests that YTHDF1 could be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment."}

Although keratin-based treatments have been popularly used to repair damaged hair, their effects in the recovery of the hair damage caused by UV light have not been well studied. Moreover, limitations related to keratin penetration depth and duration of effect persist. Encapsulating active ingredients in liposomes has been shown to enhance their stability, bioavailability and permeability. Thus, we aimed to design cationic liposomes encapsulated with keratin to enhance the recovery effects of photo-damaged hair. We prepared keratin-incorporated cationic liposomes (KLs) via high-pressure homogenization and assessed their physical properties via hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses. The physical and chemical damage level of hair samples before and after treatment, such as hair smoothness, protein degradation and lipid peroxidation, were subsequently investigated using electron microscopy and different spectroscopies. The results indicated that the cationic liposomes fabricated by high-pressure homogenization method had combined unilamellar and multilamellar structures. Compared with the keratin solution, the KL suspension significantly improved the permeation of keratin into the cortex during a 24-h incubation. Moreover, 24 and 48-h UV-exposed hairs showed enhanced recovery when incubated with keratin liposomes for 24 h, as evidenced by the observation of a smoother hair surface using electron microscopy. We observed that treatment with keratin liposomes significantly reduced protein denaturation and lipid peroxidation in the photo-damaged hairs. We anticipate that cationic liposome-assisted keratin delivery may serve as an effective method for restoring photo-damaged hair in both the physical and chemical dimensions.

Here we use proteomic analysis to characterize changes in the wound healing response across three biomaterial treatments: a clinically used collagen hydrogel, and two synthetic biomaterials that are characterized by an increased regenerative response either through decreased fibrosis or through an activation of adaptive immunity. We identified close to 5,000 proteins shared across the biomaterial treatment groups, sampled at timepoints representing the inflammation, proliferation, and resolution phases of wound healing. The collagen hydrogel maintains an enrichment of immune-related pathways throughout the healing process. The fibrosis-suppressing material enriches gene ontology (GO) terms related to increased epidermis development pathways, collagen synthesis, and collagen fibril organization. In contrast, the adaptive immunity-activating biomaterial shows an early enrichment of GO terms related to broad immunity and inflammation. Later, this same material promotes keratinization, muscle and lipid oxidation GO pathways. Taken together, this work determines the key temporal pathways (immunity, keratinization, muscle system process, and ECM organization) mediated by three biomaterials, which result in varying healed tissue structure."}

RCS was prepared through electron beam irradiation and cross-linking followed by freeze-drying. Its properties were evaluated, including Fourier transform infrared analysis, swelling behavior, microscopic observation, porosity measurement, compression modulus and structural stability. In a rat gingival recession model with 96 rats divided into four groups, the root coverage index and gingival health indices were measured, and histological analyses were conducted. The cross-linked network structure of RCS provided excellent mechanical properties and stability. In the rat model, RCS effectively promoted gingival regeneration, with the RCS group achieving a root coverage index of 87.7 \u00b1 2.7 %, which was 54.13 %, 42.83 % and 8.41 % higher than that of the sham operation group, non-crosslinked group and chemical crosslinked group respectively. Histological analysis showed that RCS promoted anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, enhanced collagen deposition and gingival lamina propria fiber density and increased angiogenesis. Additionally, RCS exhibited good biosafety, as blood indices and organ coefficients remained normal. In conclusion, RCS effectively promotes gingival regeneration and is a promising keratinized gingiva substitute for gingival recession, offering a new option for oral tissue repair."}

We quantified shell lesion type and prevalence by using visual inspections of photographs collected of the plastron and carapace and then applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the associated bacteriomes of shells that observed pits, ulcerations, or no lesions. We observed shell lesions at high frequencies throughout our sites, with larger individuals (>100-mm plastron length) more likely to possess injuries. We saw no differences in alpha diversities between shells presenting with lesions and those on which we did not observe lesions; however, swab samples showed higher bacterial richness than keratin scrapes. The bacterial composition within the scrapes was influenced by pond location and then lesion presence. We observed a higher relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Cyanobacteria, and Deinococcota in the shell keratin microflora of turtles with shell lesions. Because western pond turtles are under consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the US, understanding patterns of shell disease pathologies and the bacteria associated with disease is imperative for the management of current populations."}

Because the protein also is a negative regulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, inactivating mutations in the SCHAD gene (HADH) cause congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) and severe hypoglycemia. Here we sought to identify novel interaction partners of SCHAD that might be particularly relevant for the endocrine pancreas. Employing the SCHAD protein as bait, we performed yeast 2-hybrid screening of a cDNA library made from human islets of Langerhans. Surprisingly, the screening revealed the intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) as a putative interaction partner of SCHAD with very high confidence. Previous reports have linked K8 to glucose homeostasis, and we confirmed the SCHAD interaction by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells. SCHAD and K8 expression were then characterized in the human \u03b2-cell model EndoC-\u03b2H1. By using proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that stimulating the cells with a high level of glucose triggered a transient increase in the interaction. However, when studying knockout mice, we found that the loss of either K8 or SCHAD did not change the expression level of the other interaction partner. Still, when K8 knockout mice were challenged with a ketogenic diet, upregulation of SCHAD expression was blunted compared to the upregulation observed in wildtype littermates. We propose that the SCHAD protein interacts with K8 in a way that might be relevant for proper functioning of the pancreatic \u03b2-cell. Whether the SCHAD-K8 interaction influences the phenotype of CHI remains to be demonstrated."}

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on epithelial tissues collected from the clear central corneal region and limbus of a 48-year-old female patient with congenital aniridia. The transcriptomic profiles were compared with those of healthy control samples. scRNA-seq analysis revealed that a subpopulation of cells from the clear central corneal region expressed the cornea-specific keratins KRT3 and KRT12 despite a significant reduction in PAX6 expression. These cells exhibited corneal, conjunctival, or mixed gene signatures. Genes associated with wound healing and apoptosis were upregulated in the cornea-like cells from the aniridic cornea, indicating a chronic wound healing state. Elevated KLF4 expression and regulon activity were observed in these cornea-like cells. Most limbal epithelial cells exhibited conjunctiva-like characteristics, reflecting a loss of limbal cell identity. While acknowledging the limitations of a single case study, this study provides deeper insights into the transcriptional signatures associated with AAK using scRNA-seq. We identified transcriptional alterations reflecting AAK progression and highlighted potential transcription factors that may contribute to corneal identity maintenance despite PAX6 deficiency. These findings enhance our understanding of AAK and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to slow its progression."}

This study aims to compare the developmental characteristics of soft palate muscles in miniature pigs and mice at various stages to better understand the patterns in large mammals. Specimens of soft palate were collected from human embryos, miniature pigs and mice at different stages. Furthermore, comprehensive gross observations, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, and immunohistochemical analyses for myosin heavy chain and Hypermethylated cancer 1 (Hic1) were conducted on multiple dissected sections. Mature soft palatal musculature exhibited anatomical and histological similarities across the three species. Notably, miniature pigs exhibited the uvula structure and uvula muscle development comparable to humans. Embryonic day 40 (E40, equivalent to human embryonic week 11, E11w) represented the early developmental stage of the uvula muscle, characterized by scattered muscle cells not yet coalescing into multinucleated fibres. By E45 (aligned with human E12w), the muscle bundles reached maturity, exhibiting two oriented fibre bundles flanking the midline. Levator veli palatini muscle and palatopharyngeus of miniature pigs exhibited a distinct course pattern due to the presence of the uvula muscle.

This study sought to establish and utilize a human biomarker to delineate PF anatomy in humans. RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis of transcriptomes from human hearts (N = 10) revealed 99 genes up-regulated in PFs vs ventricular myocardium and endocardium. Whole-mount megablock cross-sectional analysis was performed with cardiac troponin, MYL4, periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's Trichrome, pro-ANP, and GJA5 colocalization. Comparative transcriptomics from human hearts (N = 10) identified myosin light chain 4 (MYL4) as a promising human PF marker for distinguishing conductive from contractile myocardium. Using PF-rich bundle branch and subendocardial regions, MYL4 specificity was validated using canonical PF markers in human (n = 3), dog (n = 3), goat (n = 3), and pig (n = 3) hearts.

This hypothesis was tested in the present study using the C2C12 myotube model. We identified vitexin, isovitexin, orientin, schaftoside, rutin, quercetin, and apigenin in the ethanolic extract of C. nutans leaves (EECN). EECN substantially boosted the protein expression of slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, and reduced fast MyHC.

Furthermore, Compound C, which inhibited AMPK, significantly inhibited the effects above in C2C12 myotubes. In conclusion, EECN transformed skeletal muscle from fast to slow fibers and improved mitochondrial function via AMPK signaling pathway, and may play an important role in anti-exercise fatigue activity.

Skeletal muscle weight and changes in skeletal muscle fiber twitch type were evaluated. Using C2C12 cells, a skeletal muscle myoblast cell line, molecules that induce a reduction in type IIa muscle fibers in CKD were identified. The identified molecule, TGF-\u03b2, was administered to mice to investigate its effects on muscle fiber-type changes. Furthermore, the effects of administering a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor to CKD mice were evaluated. In CKD mice, myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-specific antibody immunostaining showed an increase in atrophied MyHC IIa (oxidative twitch) muscle fibers. CKD mouse serum preferentially induces MyHC IIa fiber atrophy in C2C12 cells. TGF-\u03b2-treated mice had reduced levels of oxidative metabolic skeletal muscle and oxidative type IIa fiber, similar to CKD mice. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor treatment prevented the CKD-associated decrease in oxidative type IIa muscle fiber size and reduced exercise capacity. These findings indicate that TGF-\u03b2 causes skeletal muscle deterioration in CKD by reducing oxidative metabolism and inducing type IIa fiber atrophy.

Besides the well-known eccentric-concentric hypertrophy paradigm in volume-pressure loading of the myocardium, pressure load seems to reduce myocardial velocities and LV function to a greater extent than volume loading.

Permeabilized porcine cardiac tissue and myofibrils were used for single-molecule imaging of ATP turn over, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical measurements. Engineered heart tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes were used to evaluate effects on force and contraction kinetics. In contrast to Mavacamten, Aficamten does not structurally sequester myosin heads along the thick filament. Aficamten inhibits ATPase activity by shifting myosin heads from higher to slower ATPase state, with the emergence of a super slow biochemical nucleotide turnover state. This results in decreased force and calcium sensitivity without altering cross-bridge cycling. These contractile mechanical changes are comparable to Mavacamten. Our myofibril mechanical assay showed inhibition of force with accelerated relaxation. In EHTs, while Mavacamten and Aficamten inhibit cardiac twitch forces, Mavacamten reduces the activation kinetics while both result in faster relaxation. We used a combination of biochemical and biomechanical assays to show that Aficamten inhibits myosin ATPase without appreciably altering myosin structure. This is different from Mavacamten that strongly affects both. While both compounds inhibit contractility, differences in mechanisms of action and kinetics of force activation and relaxation could allow use in different patient populations."}

There has been great interest in how the physical state of the NPC can influence nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. The hypothesis that the NPC may be mechanosensitive is supported by prior reports showing that the diameter of the NPC increases with nuclear envelope stretch as well as increased ECM stiffness. We therefore sought to develop a biosensor-based approach to determine if the NPC experiences mechanical tension. Using a previously developed FRET-force biosensor, known as TSmod, we developed a gp210 tension sensor. gp210 is a transmembrane nucleoporin, which may serve to anchor the NPC into the nuclear envelope. Using a CRISPR knock-in strategy, we developed a HeLa cell line which expresses the gp210 tension sensor at endogenous levels. Using this sensor, we observed that gp210 forces increase in response to osmotically induced nuclear swelling. Cell attachment, ECM stiffness, the nuclear LINC complex, chromatin condensation, and actomyosin contractility were all observed to influence gp210 forces. Surprisingly, gp210 forces were increased with chromatin relaxation and myosin light chain kinase inhibition, indicating that NPC forces may be differentially regulated from forces on the LINC complex. Our data support a hypothesis where nuclear strain, rather than cytoskeletal forces, is the predominant source for NPC forces. Our studies demonstrate that NPC proteins do experience mechanical tension. We anticipate that the gp210 force sensor will be of use for future studies of NPC mechanobiology."}

The microbiota influences gut peptide production, including ghrelin, glucagon like pepetide-1 (GLP-1), serotonin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), thereby modulating nutrient absorption and immune responses. Gut hormones such as ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), serotonin (5-HT), neurotensin, peptide YY (PYY) and melatonin play key roles in the GBA. These hormones play several roles including modulation of appetite and satiety, metabolism of nutrients such as lipid and glucose, insulin and glucagon secretion, and influence on gut inflammation, mood, learning and cognition. The interaction between gut microbiota and these hormones underscores their role in maintaining gut-brain homeostasis. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, is linked to altered stress responses, anxiety, and depressive behaviors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of microbiota modulation. Despite the significant roles of gut hormones and microbiota in the GBA, literature on their cellular and molecular mechanisms is limited, and often based on animal models. This review synthesizes current understanding of hormones secreted by the intestine, their physiological effects and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action underlying these effects, with a focus on their roles in the GBA. By elucidating these complex relationships, the review aims to advance research and clinical applications, offering insights into gastrointestinal and systemic health."}

Being a common chronic disorder, it is managed by doctors across all specialties worldwide. Despite the availability of new medications, healthcare professionals continue to face ambiguity due to differing terminologies and variations in regional practices. This review aims to elucidate the current therapeutic spectrum of injectable therapies in diabetes care, providing clarity on the types, mechanisms, and clinical implications of both insulin and non-insulin injections. An extensive review of existing literature was conducted, focusing on insulin injections (including short-acting, rapid-acting, ultra-rapid acting, intermediate-acting, long acting and ultra-long-acting types), non-insulin injections (such as glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists, dual GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide [GIP] agonist, and amylin analogs) and co-formulations (long-acting insulin with GLP-1 or long-acting insulin with rapid acting insulin). We have included innovators and biosimilars in this review article for better understanding. Insulin therapies offer tailored glycemic control, while non-insulin injectables provide additional benefits in weight management and reduced hypoglycemia risk. This review serves as a comprehensive guide for healthcare providers worldwide to navigate the landscape of injectable treatment options in diabetes, with a focus on optimizing therapeutic outcomes through informed decision-making."}

Recent studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor agonists can improve cognitive function through brain activation in patients with T2DM, compared to other oral glucose-lowering drugs. Mazdutide, a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR), has been shown to simultaneously reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and other comorbidities associated with obesity in patients with T2DM. While its insulinotropic and glucose-lowering effects through the GLP-1 pathway are well-established, mazdutide may also enhance energy expenditure via activation of the GCGR pathway. However, its potential impact on cognitive function remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of mazdutide on cognitive behaviour and cerebral pathology in male db/db mice, a model of T2DM, in comparison to dulaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. All animal findings are applicable to male mice only. Behavioural tests were conducted to evaluate cognitive function, and pathological analyses were performed to assess neurodegenerative markers in the brain. Furthermore, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomics analyses were employed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of mazdutide's effects. Compared to dulaglutide, mazdutide significantly improved cognitive performance in db/db mice, as evidenced by comprehensive behavioural tests. Pathological assessments revealed improvements in neuronal structure and brain tissue integrity in the mazdutide-treated group. Multi-omics analyses further identified distinct molecular pathways involved in neuroprotection, energy metabolism, and synaptic plasticity, suggesting that dual GLP-1/GCGR activation contributes to enhanced cognitive resilience. Our findings indicate that mazdutide, via its dual GLP-1/GCGR activation effects, exerts multifactorial improvements in cognitive function in the context of obesity and T2DM. These results suggest that mazdutide is a promising therapeutic option for mitigating cognitive deficits associated with metabolic disorders.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry plays a crucial role in identifying these alterations, yet the clinical significance remains debated. While gray matter volume and cortical curvature are commonly analyzed, cortical thickness offers a more direct measure of cytoarchitectural differences and neuroplastic changes in migraine. Advanced structural MRI techniques, including surface-based morphometry and voxel-based morphometry, have provided insights into cortical thickness alterations in migraine. These methods enable high-resolution assessment of brain morphometry, revealing dynamic changes associated with migraine phases and treatment.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes findings from cortical thickness studies, focusing on methodological approaches, variations in imaging sequences and study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.ResultsStudies using surface-based morphometry (i.e. SBM) and voxel-based morphometry (i.e. VBM) have reported inconsistent findings. Increased thickness is frequently observed in pain-processing regions, such as the somatosensory cortex, insula and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting hyperexcitability or maladaptive neuroplasticity. by contrast, cortical thinning has been noted in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and visual cortex, suggesting neuronal loss or impaired cortical integrity. Differences between episodic and chronic migraine further highlight progressive structural changes associated with disease burden. Emerging evidence also suggests that preventive treatments, including calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies and botulinum toxin A, may reverse some of these cortical alterations, particularly in treatment responders.ConclusionsCortical thickness analysis provides valuable insights into migraine pathophysiology, offering a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response.

Although great progress has been made in bone tissue engineering, reconstruction of neural networks is still a challenge and leads to limited osteogenesis. Nerve growth factor (NGF) guides the innervation in the early stage of bone healing, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are continuously expressed during the bone healing process that can induce osteogenic differentiation. A microsphere-hydrogel scaffold mimicking the dynamic performance of NGF and BMPs in a timely manner is designed and constructed via 3D printing. The scaffold enables rapid release of NGF mimetic peptide and long-lasting sustained release of BMP-2 mimetic peptide, which aims at restoring innervation. The rapid release of NGF mimetic peptide could significantly promote migration of RSC96 and axon elongation of pheochromocytoma cells in vitro. Meanwhile, co-delivery of NGF/BMP-2 mimetic peptides could synergistically enhance osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-dependent signaling pathway. Moreover, the scaffold accelerates neural network reconstruction and effectively improves new bone regeneration in vivo.

This case report presents a 30-year-old woman with a long-standing history of cystic acne, which persisted despite numerous treatments, including antibiotics and hormonal therapy for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The patient was prescribed rimegepant, a CGRP receptor antagonist, for migraine management. Within four weeks of starting rimegepant, the patient experienced significant improvement in her cystic acne, particularly on her chin, which had been the most affected area. The painful lesions cleared almost entirely, and the patient reported a reduction in both cosmetic and physical discomfort. The cystic acne did not recur, except for a minor episode during a period of high stress. This case suggests that CGRP inhibition may have potential therapeutic benefits for inflammatory skin conditions such as cystic acne. The mechanism may involve modulation of neurogenic inflammation, which plays a role in the development of acne. CGRP's involvement in sebaceous gland activity and its inflammatory effects make it a promising target for acne treatment.

We searched for observational studies that investigated the associations between AHTN use and KC through January 2025. To identify the independent effects of AHTN from hypertension, we conducted stratified analyses with and without accounting for hypertension: any methods (matching, adjustment, or stratification/restriction) versus none. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses with robust variance estimation to calculate pooled relative risk (RR). In this meta-analysis consisting of 39 eligible studies, AHTN use was associated with an increased risk of KC based on estimates that accounted for hypertension (RR 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.52 for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.31 for angiotensin receptor blocker; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16 for beta-blocker, RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.12-1.75 for calcium channel blocker (CCB); RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.55 for diuretic; and RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.75 for non-classified AHTN). Findings from duration\u2012response relationships supported the main findings. AHTN use was associated with an increased risk of KC compared to no use, even after accounting for hypertension, with the highest risk observed for CCB. Our findings highlight the potential KC risks associated with different AHTN classes, with optimal cardiovascular care remaining an important consideration."}

Immune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals. NVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains.

Furthermore, inactivation of ERK1/2 with PD98059 reduced Ang II-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Dual luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results confirmed that MCPIP1 was transcriptionally regulated by KLF4.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, is a potent vasoconstrictor in afferent arterioles. We hypothesized that IR enhanced afferent arteriolar sensitivity to S1P-induced vasoconstriction, thus contributing to renal microvascular dysfunction and kidney injury in AKI. The impact of IR on afferent arteriolar reactivity to S1P was assessed using the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation in male rats subjected to 60 minutes of bilateral renal arterial ischemia followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Baseline diameter of afferent arterioles declined significantly following IR. S1P evoked concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in both sham and IR rats. However, the S1P concentration-response curve left-shifted after IR and its EC50 reduced by 8-fold (P < 0.05), suggesting enhanced afferent arteriolar reactivity to S1P. S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) blockade with JTE-013 increased arteriolar diameter by 38 \u00b1 7% following IR contrasted to a 9 \u00b1 3% increase in sham rats (P < 0.05), indicating that endogenous S1P exerts a significant impact on afferent arteriolar tone after IR.

This study explores the physiological functions and metabolic regulation of RkACS1 and RkACS2, revealing distinct roles for these isoenzymes in metabolic processes. RkACS1 is essential for utilizing non-fermentable carbon sources such as acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, exhibiting high affinity for acetate and being activated by acetate while inhibited by glucose. Additionally, RkACS1 is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. In contrast, RkACS2, while not specific to particular carbon sources, is primarily involved in lipid and fatty acid synthesis. It also influences gene expression through histone acetylation in the nucleus. Notably, these two isoenzymes exhibit functional redundancy and mutual regulation. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic regulation of acetyl-CoA synthesis, offering a foundation for engineering strategies aimed at optimizing secondary metabolite production in oleaginous red yeasts.

Recently, replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling was developed to specifically mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this technique, nucleosome behavior was revealed across four chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin. Interestingly, nucleosome motion is progressively constrained along this spectrum. Nucleosomes in euchromatin domains fluctuate more like a liquid, whereas those in heterochromatin are highly constrained, resembling a gel-like state. How these physical properties relate to DNA/chromatin accessibility and genome function remains an important question.

Since brown fat dissipates more energy than white fat it is commonly characterized by increased mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of thermogenic genes to enhance energy expenditure. Although fat browning can have different mechanisms, this review focusses on epigenetic mechanisms that underline browning of fat. These epigenetic mechanisms comprise DNA methylation (DNMTs), histone modifications (HDACs, H3K27Me3) and non-coding RNA (miR133, miR26, miR34a) mediated regulation. These epigenetic mechanisms in turn are triggered by diet and exercise, environmental factors such as temperature, obesity and comorbidities such as diabetes and blood pressure. The triggered epigenetic mechanisms in turn trigger genes such as UCP1 which are associated with thermogenesis in adipocytes and hence fat browning.

Here, we identified a transcription factor of CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, and TOC1(CCT) family, OsCCT22, that physically interacts with OsSh1 in rice. oscct22 mutants exhibited a phenotype similar to ossh1 mutants, characterized by incomplete development of abscission layers and reduced seed shattering ability.

Notably, transcription of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) gene OsCAD2, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT), and O-methyltransferase 16 (ROMT-16) was directly inhibited by OsSh1 binding to their key binding motif. This repression was enhanced by the interaction between OsCCT22 and OsSh1. Additionally, our study suggests that OsSh1 regulates the transcription of OsCAD2 by modulating histone methylation modifications near the first intron. Loss-of-function mutations in OsCAD2 led to the formation of more extensive abscission layers and a significant reduction in lignin deposition, resulting in natural seed shattering.

Arg41 is the preferred cleavage site for both proteases in the absence of receptors.

Here, we hypothesized that both receptors alleviate inhibitory interactions of the P2-Leu45 residue on the extracellular domain of PAR1 with protease catalytic pockets. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a PAR1-R41A mutant in which P2-Leu45 of the receptor was substituted with a Pro. Both PAR1-R41A and PAR1-R41A-L45P constructs were transfected to PAR1-knockout EA.hy926 endothelial cells lacking or expressing EPCR or TM followed by monitoring the protease activation of receptors by signaling assays. Furthermore, wildtype or EPCR and TM expressing HEK-293 cells were transfected with PAR1 cleavage reporter constructs carrying N-terminal NanoLuc luciferase and C-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein tags. Signaling and receptor cleavage assays indicated that both APC and thrombin cleave Arg46 in cells expressing PAR1-R41A-L45P, but not PAR1-41A, independent of their receptors.

We aimed to assess safety and escalating intravenous (i.v.) doses of APAC on hemostasis using a large animal model. We studied escalating APAC boluses (0.15-1.5 mg/kg; n = 11) and their reversal in anesthetized pigs for pharmacodynamics using functional coagulation testing. In some experiments, aspirin (500 mg) was co-administered with APAC, and protamine sulfate for reversal. Blood was repeatedly sampled for blood cell counts (CBC), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin and thrombin time (PT, TT), thrombin generation (TG), activated clotting time (ACT), rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and collagen-induced platelet aggregation (CIPA). APAC was well-tolerated, and CBC remained stable. APAC modestly inhibited CIPA at high doses, while APTT, TT and ACT, unlike PT, prolonged dose-dependently. The anticoagulant ED Escalating i.v. doses of APAC were safe and provided modest platelet inhibition.Our results indicate that the dose-dependent anticoagulation effects of APAC can be monitored using conventional laboratory assays."}

Although thrombin is a widely used hemostatic agent, its efficacy is limited in the harsh environment of the digestive tract, especially in patients with chronic liver disease or coagulation disorders. Current treatment techniques often fall short, particularly when faced with severe blood loss and coagulation challenges. Here, a novel solution: waxberry-inspired smart nanogels that offer a cost-effective, highly efficient, and mechanically stable approach for local hemostasis is presented. Drawing inspiration from the microfibrous structures of waxberry, a waxberry-like nano-silica with a radially fibrous structure is synthesized for effective thrombin loading and release upon emergency. This nano-silica, coated with GelMA, forms a stable nanogel network activated by blue laser during endoscopy. Within just 5 s, the nanogel effectively triggers coagulation, even in patients with coagulation disorders. The formed blood clots are stable enough to withstand the challenging conditions of the digestive tract, preventing secondary bleeding. Upon injection, thrombin rapidly converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a secondary network that reinforces clot stability. This dual-network system demonstrates strong adhesive properties and effective hemostasis in the blood of cirrhotic patients, as well as in gastrointestinal bleeding scenarios involving the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum of mini-pigs."}
{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "thrombin", "text": "BACKGROUND Injury to the inferior epigastric artery is a major complication of abdominal puncture, and continuous active bleeding from this artery can lead to hemorrhagic shock. Several studies have reported the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to diagnose active bleeding in parenchymal organs. Fluid gelatin is a new hemostatic material that can be injected into the bleeding site by using a puncture needle under the precise guidance of CEUS, which enables the implementation of local minimally invasive and appropriate hemostatic treatment. Here, we report the case of a patient in whom CEUS was used to accurately locate the bleeding site before surgery and guide local injection of fluid gelatin with a puncture needle to successfully achieve nonsurgical treatment of hemostasis. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old man with post-hepatitis B cirrhosis underwent a successful liver transplant surgery. After surgery, abdominal puncture and drainage were performed because of a large amount of peritoneal effusion due to nephrotic syndrome. The drainage fluid was bright red bloody liquid. CEUS revealed many contrast agent microbubbles extravasating from the inferior epigastric artery into peritoneal effusion along the abdominal puncture tract. Surgical suturing and applying a compression bandage failed to achieve satisfactory results. After receiving the patient's consent, thrombin and hemostatic glue were injected locally under the guidance of CEUS. Finally, hemostasis was successfully achieved. CONCLUSIONS CEUS-guided injection of fluid gelatin is a safe and effective treatment method and could serve as an effective measure for nonsurgical treatment and postoperative supplementary treatment of active bleeding from the inferior epigastric artery."}

Despite the availability of anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, their clinical use is often limited by adverse effects. Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE), a traditional herbal medicine, has shown promise in alleviating thrombosis, but its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to explore the antithrombotic effects and molecular mechanisms of GbE through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments. Online databases were utilized for identifying the GbE's active components and target genes, accompanied by thrombosis-related targets. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were performed. A drug-active component-target gene-signaling pathway network and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed to determine core target genes and pathways. In vivo, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) model was established by ligating the inferior vena cava in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was adopted for evaluating the vascular endothelial structure. The levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), nitric oxide (NO), and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured, accompanied by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the PI3K/AKT pathway-related protein expression. GbE comprised 27 active components with 4727 target genes and 2462 thrombosis-related targets, with 974 shared targets, including AKT1, ALB, GAPDH, TNF, and IL6, enriched in PI3K-AKT and AGE-RAGE pathways. Molecular docking indicated strong binding of GbE's main components to core targets. In vivo, GbE significantly relieved vascular lesions of DVT rats; reduced thrombotic wet weight; increased NO, cGMP, and PGI2 levels; decreased FIB; and prolonged APTT, PT, and TT (P < 0.05). Additionally, Western blot highlighted the suppressed p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios in DVT rats. GbE alleviates thrombosis by increasing antithrombotic factors and reducing coagulation, potentially via downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling. Future studies should focus on long-term clinical trials and broader animal models to further validate GbE's therapeutic potential and explore other molecular mechanisms."}

The experimental group was divided into mild MPP group (n=70 ) and severe MPP group (n=50 ) according to the severity of the disease. According to the condition after one course of treatment, separated MPP children into good prognosis group (n=96) and poor prognosis group (n=24). The IL-6 and PCT levels of the experimental/control group before treatment and the good/bad prognosis group after treatment were compared, respectively. The lung function of children with MPP before and after treatment was also examined, and the changes of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), expiratory time (Te), peak time (TPTEF), and peak volume (VPTEF) were observed. The correlation between pulmonary function and IL-6, PCT in MPP children was analyzed by Pearson analysis. Receiver operation curve was adopted to analyze the predictive value of IL-6, PCT for poor prognosis. IL-6 and PCT were increased in the severe MPP group compared to the mild MPP group (P<0.001) and tended to decrease in the good prognosis group compared to the poor prognosis group (P<0.001). Fifty-nine of the 70 cases in the good prognosis group were patients with mild MPP, suggesting that patients with mild MPP have a better prognosis. The results of respiratory function showed an increase in RR (P<0.001) and a decrease in VT (P=0.007), TPTEF/Te (P<0.001), VPTEF/VT (P<0.001) in the severe MPP group compared to the mild MPP group.

This study aims to explore the mechanism of SSMDD against CB, focusing on its active components and their impact on Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a key inflammatory factor. Network pharmacology, a method that helps identify potential active components and their interactions in a biological network, was used to predict SSMDD's effects. Molecular docking, a computational approach for predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target proteins, was utilized to elucidate the mechanisms of action. Transcriptomic analysis, ELISA, and western blot assays were subsequently implemented for mechanism validation. Network pharmacology analysis identified quercetin and kaempferol as key active components of SSMDD, with a high affinity for IL-6. Transcriptomic data confirmed the regulation of inflammation-related pathways by SSMDD, aligning with the predicted targets. In the ELISA determination, compared with the model group, the IL-6 levels in the samples treated with quercetin and kaempferol were reduced by 55% and 36%, respectively. The western blot results showed that the expression of IL-6 protein in these samples decreased by 33% and 25%, respectively. SSMDD exhibits anti-inflammatory activity against CB by targeting IL-6. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which SSMDD exerts its therapeutic effects on CB.

This was a case series study. Reviewed were consecutive biopsy-proven B-cell VRL cases of which adequate paired AqH and VH samples were obtained for the measurement of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).

We try to investigate the effects of novel aptamers targeting the sclerostin loop3 on the skeleton and muscle of orchiectomized (ORX) mice. After 12 weeks of ORX surgery, mice were randomly assigned to receive treatment with sclerostin aptamers (Apc001OA or Apc001OA-d6), alendronate (ALN), teriparatide (PTH 1-34) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After 12 weeks of treatment, skeletal and muscle properties and safety indicators were evaluated in detail. Treatment with Apc001OA and Apc001OA-d6 significantly increased trabecular BMD at the femur by +11.9% and +17.1%, improved parameters of bone microarchitecture (BV/TV by +84.5% and +106.8%), bone strength (maximum load by +30.5% and +31.6%) and bone histological properties (all p < 0.05 vs. PBS group).

Multicellular liver microtissues comprising LX2 stellate cells, HepG2 hepatocytes and HUVECs were generated to establish a robust preclinical model for fibrosis. Cell viability and histological assessments confirmed successful co-aggregation within the microtissues. To induce fibrosis, they were treated with a palmitic and oleic acid mixture, followed by exposure to Nicotinamide. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated by analysing inflammatory factors, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 6. Extracellular matrix deposition was assessed by measuring collagen type I (COL I) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Our data suggested that Nicotinamide application led to significant improvements across several measures. Specifically, it effectively reduced inflammatory response by reducing TGF-\u03b21 levels and decreasing COL I and \u03b1-SMA levels. Furthermore, Nicotinamide was crucial in reducing reactive oxygen species levels, indicating that activation of HSC, inflammatory signals and oxidative stress work together.

We aimed to replicate previous work showing higher RAAS activity among those with PTSD. We aimed to characterize associations between RAAS activity, psychophysiological arousal, and estradiol among trauma-exposed females. Cardiovascular measures included heart rate (HR), high frequency HR variability (HF-HRV), and blood pressure (BP) at rest, as well as HR, HF-HRV, and fear potentiated startle (FPS) during fear conditioning. No significant effects of PTSD (n = 37 with PTSD) were found for renin, aldosterone, or the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). Higher renin and aldosterone levels were associated with higher HR (r's = 0.31-0.41, p's < 0.05); higher renin was associated with larger magnitude FPS (r = 0.49, p = .015); higher ARRs were associated with lower HF-HRV (r = -0.54, p = .003). Differences were found by estradiol level, as higher renin and aldosterone levels were associated with higher HR among those with low estradiol (r's = 0.40-0.63, p's < 0.05). While our findings showed associations between RAAS and previously indicated psychophysiological markers of PTSD, we did not replicate existing work showing a direct relationship between RAAS activity and PTSD.

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "renin", "text": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a chronic kidney condition that arises from prolonged hyperglycaemia that can progress to kidney failure, severe morbidity, and mortality if left untreated. It is the major cause of chronic kidney disease among people who have diabetes, accounting for a significant percentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease who require kidney replacement therapy. In DKD, numerous dysbalanced metabolic, haemodynamic, inflammatory signalling pathways, and molecular mediators interconnect, creating a feedback loop that promotes general kidney damage. Hyperglycaemia is the primary trigger for DKD and leads gradually to oxidative stress, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis, glomerular hypertension, and intrarenal hypoxia. Key interconnected metabolic pathways are the hyperglycaemia-mediated polyol, hexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation end-products pathway hyperactivity. Concurrently, hyperglycaemia-induced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulation, alters the kidney intraglomerular haemodynamic leading to inflammation through Toll-like receptors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappa B, transforming growth factor-beta-mediated excessive extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. The resulting death signals trigger apoptosis and autophagy through Hippo, Notch, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation and microRNA dysregulation. These signals synergistically remodel the kidneys culminating in intrarenal hypoxia, podocyte dysfunction, hyperfiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and loss of kidney function. The resulting renal failure further upregulates these death pathways and mediators, giving rise to a vicious cycle that further worsens DKD. This review provides an overview of the primary molecular mediators and signalling pathways leading to DKD; their interconnectivity at the onset and during DKD progression, the central role of transforming growth factor-beta via different pathways, the Hippo pathway kidney-specific response to hyperglycaemia, and how all mediators and transduction signals result in a vicious circle that exacerbates renal failure. The review gives therapeutic sights to these pathways as druggable targets for DKD management. Understanding these molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of DKD can bridge basic research and clinical application, facilitating the development of innovative management strategies."}

This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of alcohol-mediated bilateral adrenal artery embolization (Bi-AAE) in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). A total of 72 patients were randomly assigned in a (1:1) ratio to receive either Bi-AAE or spironolactone (20-60 mg/day). The primary endpoint was the change in office systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 6 months. Key secondary endpoints included changes in 24 h blood pressure, aldosterone levels, aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), and serum potassium. At 6 months, Bi-AAE significantly reduced office SBP compared to spironolactone (-18.9 \u00b1 16.4 mmHg vs. -11.6 \u00b1 9.3 mmHg; treatment difference: -7.4 mmHg; P = 0.03), with a greater proportion of Bi-AAE patients achieving target SBP (<140 mmHg; 77.1% vs. 51.5%; P = 0.027). Bi-AAE also resulted in significantly greater reductions in 24 h and home SBP at 1, 3, and 6 months (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, Bi-AAE was more effective in correcting biochemical abnormalities, including hyperaldosteronism and renin suppression (all P < 0.05). Importantly, Bi-AAE preserved zona fasciculata function, as evidenced by normal morning serum cortisol levels and intact responses to ACTH stimulation post-procedure. No serious adverse events occurred during the perioperative or 6-month follow-up period. These findings support Bi-AAE as a safe, minimally invasive, and highly effective alternative to medical therapy for managing IHA.

This study aimed to investigate the association between RAAS blockade, AKI and survival in HNC patients undergoing CCRT. This retrospective cohort study included 989 HNC patients treated between January 2016 and July 2022, with follow-up extending to July 2022. Among them, 65 (6.6%) patients were using RAAS blockade for hypertension control, while 924 were non-users. Clinical data and demographics were retrieved. Cox regression models were employed to analyze primary outcomes, including AKI and patient survival. There were 65 (6.6%) patients being RAAS blockade users in the study. The mean age of RAAS blockade users was older than that of non-users (61 vs. 55 years old, p < 0.001). Overall, 219 (22.1%) patients developed AKI, including 25 RAAS blockade users. RAAS blockade users had a higher risk of AKI compared to non-users (38% vs. 21%, p = 0.001) and also had a worse mortality rate (35% vs. 22%, p = 0.015). Factors such as male gender, age, RAAS blockade usage, and baseline serum creatinine levels independently predicted the onset of AKI and patient survival. RAAS blockade users developed AKI, which significantly predicted patient survival. Diligent post-CCRT renal function monitoring and hydration in RAAS blockade users are crucial to mitigate AKI risk and potentially improve survival in this patient group."}

It induced spinal cord and sciatic nerve neuron damage, axonal demyelination, and reduced Schwann cells number. CSE administration with PTX improved behavioral responses, reduced oxidative and inflammatory markers, restored antioxidant and RAS signal balance, and preserved nerve tissue structure. Docking showed strong binding of CSE components with NF-\u03baB, MPO, and ACE, suggesting direct inhibitory interactions.

Blood pressure, the urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio (UAld: Cre), echocardiographic variables, and heart rate variability were assessed pre- and post-treatment. High-dose alacepril reduced blood pressure and left ventricular dimensions, indicating a reduced preload and afterload.

While nanoparticles offer a large surface area, they are not the only surface in the sample with which the proteins interact due to the creation of other interfaces in an experimental setup. In this work, we examine the role of the air-water interface in protein denaturation via soft corona studies with citrate-capped gold nanoparticles. Chymotrypsin (ChT) protein in the soft corona was observed to exhibit an inverse relationship between concentration and denaturation, an air-water interface-mediated trend that, without the right control experiments, can be misinterpreted to be caused by protein-NP interactions. We show that any protein denaturation observed comes from the synergistic effect of the air-water interface and agitation and that NPs did not denature ChT in the \"soft corona\" in the absence of these two factors. While the propensity to adsorb and denature at hydrophobic interfaces varies among proteins with different structural properties, it is important to use simplified procedures that minimize interfacial areas other than the nanoparticle surface in corona studies to prevent misattribution of the observed effects."}

This protective mechanism is essential for eliminating the cause of injury, removing damaged cells, and initiating the repair process. While inflammation is a fundamental component of the body's defense and healing process, its dysregulation can lead to pathological consequences, contributing to various acute and chronic diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, and other systemic complications. Generally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), antihistamines, biologics, and colchicine are used as pharmacological agents in the management of inflammatory diseases. However, these conventional treatments often have limitations, including adverse side effects, long-term toxicity, and drug resistance. In contrast, enzyme-based therapeutics have emerged as a promising alternative due to their high specificity, catalytic efficiency, and ability to modulate inflammatory pathways with reduced side effects. These enzymes function by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting cytokine transcription, degrading circulating cytokines, and blocking cytokine release by targeting exocytosis-related receptors. Additionally, their role in tissue repair and regeneration further enhances their therapeutic potential. Most natural anti-inflammatory enzymes belong to the oxidoreductase class, including catalase and superoxide dismutase, as well as hydrolases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, nattokinase, bromelain, papain, serratiopeptidase, collagenase, hyaluronidase, and lysozyme.

Recent advancements in enzyme engineering, nanotechnology-based enzyme delivery, and biopharmaceutical formulations have further expanded their applicability in treating inflammatory diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of both natural and engineered enzymes, along with their formulations, used as anti-inflammatory therapeutics.

To restore redox homeostasis cancer cells evolve to activate redox protective mechanisms. This differential activation of redox defense pathways compared to normal cells provides a therapeutic window for novel targeted therapies in cancer. Although the heme metabolism emerges as a crucial regulator of redox homeostasis and iron metabolism in cancer cells with frequent alteration in breast cancer, it remains largely unexplored, and no targeted translational approaches have been developed. Heme-regulated redox homeostasis is coordinately maintained through biosynthetic and degradation pathways. As a byproduct of TCA cycle, cytotoxic heme is initially derivatized by heme oxygenases and progressively metabolized to the potent antioxidant bilirubin by two non-redundant biliverdin reductases, BLVRA and BLVRB. BLVRB overexpression has been observed in breast cancers, although its function in breast cancer pathogenesis remains unknown. Methods CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of BLVRB in multiple breast cancer cell lines demonstrated its profound effect on intracellular redox state and cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft models. Integrated proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic studies identified and validated BLVRB-mediated adaptive metabolic responses required for breast cancer cell cytoprotection. Results We have established BLVRB as a requisite component of the pro-survival redox defense mechanism in breast cancer cells. Targeted deletion of BLVRB induces reductive stress, leading to alterations in endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis and lipid composition. These defects impact plasma membrane functionality and endosomal recycling of multiple oncogenic receptors, such as HER2 and transferrin receptors.

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "transferrin", "text": "Colorectal cancer is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal malignancy leading to mortality. The prolonged efficacy of chemotherapeutic medications has been hindered by their limited capacity to reach the intended target, their lack of specificity in targeting tumors, their non-specific dispersion throughout the body and limited availability at the tumor location, and their undesired adverse effects. Targeted drug delivery to the colon enhances drug concentration at the desired location, resulting in a reduced dosage requirement and consequently, fewer side effects. This review article provides a thorough discussion of the numerous pathways that may cause colorectal cancer. The concept of drug targeting in colorectal cancer using nanovesicles has been addressed in detail in this article. This can be accomplished either by passive targeting or active targeting through receptor-ligand interaction by attaching certain active targeting moieties, such as folic acid, epidermal growth factor receptor, GE-11 peptide, EpCAM aptamer, and transferrin, over the surface of nanovesicle. This review showcases applications of nanovesicle systems, such as liposomes, phytosomes, polymeric micelles, niosomes, cubosomes, emulsomes, polymersomes and lipopolymersomes in drug delivery for the management of colorectal cancer. The nanovesicle systems have significant potential in managing colorectal cancer and overcoming the challenges encountered with current therapy methods."}
{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "transferrin", "text": "Transferrin saturation (TS) is associated with mortality across populations, but its nonlinear relationship with all-cause mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) and the role of systemic inflammation remain unclear. This study explored the association between TS and mortality in CAD patients, focusing on systemic inflammation as a potential mediator. Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006 included 769 CAD patients (>18 years) with available TS and mortality records. Systemic inflammation markers, such as the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models, and mediation analyses examined the interactions between TS, inflammation, and mortality. A U-shaped relationship between TS and all-cause mortality was observed, with an inflection point at 30.5%. TS levels \u226430.5% were inversely associated with mortality (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P < 0.0001), while levels >30.5% increased mortality risk (HR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P < 0.001). Systemic inflammation markers (SII/SIRI) were associated with and may partially mediate the relationship between low TS (\u226430.5%) and mortality. (mediation proportions: 28.5% and 21.8%, respectively). No mediation effects were found for TS > 30.5%. TS demonstrates a U-shaped relationship with all-cause mortality in CAD patients. Systemic inflammation is linked to both TS and mortality outcomes, suggesting potential mechanistic interplay. Maintaining TS within 20-30% and addressing inflammation may reduce mortality risk."}

A total of 70 patients suffering from esophageal and gastric cancer were selected for participation in the study using the open randomization method and divided into two groups of 35 people. Patients of the first group took domestic enteral nutrition LEOVIT ONCO, patients of the second group took imported enteral nutrition. Anthropometric indicators, laboratory and questionnaire data were assessed: during the initial consultation, before admission to the hospital - 14 days before hospitalization, immediately upon hospitalization, before surgery, in the first three days after surgery, before discharge. Data collection and processing was carried out by the staff of the Department of Faculty Surgery No. 2 named after G.I. Lukomsky based on the University Clinical Hospital No. 4 of Sechenov University. Statistical analysis was performed using the StatTech v. 4.6.3 program (developer - StatTech LLC, Russia). Domestic detoxifying enteral nutrition ensures normalization of body weight, an increase in the level of total protein, albumin and transferrin in the blood of patients before discharge by 15.3%, 16.4% and 74%, respectively, compared with the initial level, while imported nutrition contributed to a less pronounced increase in these indicators - by 11.8%, 9.6% and 48%, respectively. Despite the fact that both groups managed to achieve the desired level of total protein, albumin, in the LEOVIT ONCO group we needed less effort in terms of parenteral nutrition, enzymatic correction of profuse diarrhea, manifested with a significant decrease in the BCC, additional infusions of albumin and amino acids, especially in patients with a BMI <18. Unlike patients taking imported enteral nutrition, in patients on the background of LEOVIT ONCO therapeutic nutrition, immune-inflammatory markers (NLR, MLR, PLR) normalized, diarrhea of the \u00abcholera\u00bb type was stopped, bowel movements occurred regularly, the amount of feces was moderate, they had a soft consistency and a formed appearance, and there was also no intestinal paresis. LEOVIT ONCO therapeutic nutrition did not cause intolerance or allergic reactions, patients did not refuse to take it and drank the entire portion. This study of domestic and imported drugs for enteral nutrition demonstrates comparable, and in some key indicators, higher clinical and economic efficiency of domestic enteral nutrition products in the perioperative period in cancer patients with nutritional status disorders. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c

The study included 55 patients with gastric cancer who underwent TGE. They were divided into 2 groups: I - TGE with DTR ( TGE with DTR does not increase duration of surgery, blood loss and postoperative morbidity. Patients after TGE and DTR were characterized by faster and more complete recovery of body weight, BMI, serum transferrin and NRI within 6 and 12 months after surgery. No between-group differences in the incidence and severity of reflux esophagitis were found. Availability of duodenum for endoscopic examination was 93.1%. TGE with DTR was followed by significantly lower incidence and severity of dumping syndrome. Patients with DTR reconstruction were characterized by faster recovery of the quality of life. TGE with DTR in patients with gastric cancer is characterized by comparable short-term results, faster recovery of nutritional status and quality of life in long-term period after surgery, lower

Using placebo-controlled randomization, we assessed the effects of supplementation with vitamin D on biochemical markers of iron status and erythropoiesis in community-dwelling older people living in the United Kingdom (UK). The BEST-D trial, designed to establish the optimum dose of vitamin D3 for future trials, had 305 participants, aged 65 years or older, randomly allocated to 4000 IU vitamin D3 (n=102), 2000 IU vitamin D3 (n=102), or matching placebo (n=101). We estimated the effect of vitamin D allocation on plasma levels of hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), ferritin, iron, transferrin, saturated transferrin (TSAT%), and the sTfR-ferritin index. Despite increases in 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, neither dose had significant effects on biochemical markers of iron status or erythropoiesis. Geometric mean concentrations were similar in vitamin D3 arms vs placebo for hepcidin (20.7 [SE 0.90] vs 20.5 [1.21] ng/mL), sTfR (0.69 [0.010] vs 0.70 [0.015] \u00b5g/mL), ferritin (97.1 [2.81] vs 97.8 [4.10] \u00b5g/L) and sTfR-ferritin ratio (0.36 [0.006] vs 0.36 [0.009]), respectively, while arithmetic mean levels were similar for iron (16.7 [0.38] vs 17.3 [0.54] \u00b5mol/L), transferrin (2.56 [0.014] vs 2.60 [0.021] g/dL), and TSAT% (26.5 [0.60] vs 27.5 [0.85]). The proportions of participants with ferritin <15 \u00b5g/L and TSAT<16% were unaltered by vitamin D3 suggesting that 12 months of daily supplementation with moderately high doses of vitamin D3 are unlikely to alter the iron status of older adults."}

However, the high cost, complex operation and dependence on advanced instruments limited its detection in small and medium-sized pastures. Thus, a detection device as a portable slide based MIPs-FL sensor was fabricated by preparing MIPs on the surface of ZnO nanoflowers functionalized slide, and it could be directly used in milk without any pre-treatments. The prepared detection device showed a high selectivity towards Lf with an imprinting factor of 9.05 and a binding affinity of 356.34 mL/g. Correspondingly, an on-line detection method for Lf was established with good linear relationship (r > 0.9680) in the range of 0.0625 mg/mL-1.00 mg/mL, and the value of LOD and LOQ were 0.0207 mg/mL and 0.0690 mg/mL, respectively.

However, its application in the food industry is limited due to its inherent instability. This study aims to evaluate the ability of two types of lactoferrin (LF)-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) complexes to encapsulate and stabilize FUC. These complexes were formed through physical mixing and enzymatic glycosylation. In the presence of CMCS, fluorescence spectra analysis revealed a static quenching interaction between LF and FUC. Furthermore, at a CMCS concentration of 0.3 wt%, the physical mixture and glycosylated LF exhibited enhanced binding affinity for FUC. FUC was encapsulated in the complexes via the antisolvent method, yielding FUC-loaded composite nanoparticles. FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed the successful encapsulation of FUC within the nanoparticles, mediated by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic forces. The higher FUC encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were achieved in composite nanoparticles when the mass ratio was 10:2. Compared to free FUC and FUC-LF nanoparticles, the FUC-LC and FUC-LCTG nanoparticles exhibited superior stability, encompassing thermal stability, light stability, and storage stability. Moreover, when the nanoparticles were applied as active fillers in sodium alginate hydrogel beads, the network structure of the gel was enhanced. These complexes hold promise as novel and efficient delivery systems for carotenoid-like active molecules, with potential for diverse commercial applications."}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Lactoferricin (Lfcin), a cationic AMP located in the N-terminal region of lactoferrin, serves as the antimicrobial active center of the intact protein. The presence of two cysteines in Lfcin allows for the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which may influence its molecular structure and antibacterial function. To investigate this hypothesis, we synthesized, purified, and identified bovine Lfcin along with two derivatives: Lfcin with a disulfide bond (Lfcin DB) and a mutated form that cannot form the disulfide bond (Lfcin C36G). We analyzed the circular dichroism spectra of these peptides under varying ionic and hydrophobic conditions, while their tertiary structures were predicted using AlphaFold3. Results indicated that increased ionic strength reduced the random coil ratios across all peptides. The secondary structure of Lfcin showed similar percentages with Lfcin C36G in the H"}

The initial zeta potentialof these three emulsions are all greater than 30 mV, and the particle sizes are less than 500 nm. Minimal changes in particle size, zeta potential, and phase behavior, along with reduced surface tension and droplet aggregation, indicated good stability. When used as a coating for spiced beef, the emulsion reduced moisture loss, inhibited microbial growth, and delayed lipid oxidation and quality deterioration. Overall, our findings provided new insights and avenues for the application of flaxseed polyphenols in the food industry."}
{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "lactoferrin", "text": "Chicken eggs represent a rich and comprehensive source of essential nutrients, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Proteins account for approximately 12-15 % of the total egg content. One of the most valuable egg white proteins (EWP) is ovotransferrin (OTF), which comprises 12-16.5 % of total EWP. OTF is a protein from the transferrin family with diverse biological functions, including antibacterial, anticancer, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Like other transferrin family proteins, OTF has a two-lobed structure (N-terminal and C-terminal), each composed of two domains and containing a single metal-binding site. The protein exists in two forms: the apo form (without a bound metal ion) and the holo form (with a bound metal ion). Sharing approximately 50 % sequence identity with lactoferrin, a protein renowned for its health-promoting properties, OTF remains underrecognized despite its similar structure and potential for even superior bioactivity, warranting further investigation. OTF can be isolated using methods such as precipitation, column chromatography, membrane techniques, or electrophoresis. However, not all of these techniques are readily scalable for industrial applications. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of OTF, focusing on its structure, biological functions, factors affecting its activity, methods of isolation and analytical techniques employed in OTF research."}

Macrophages play a crucial role in myopic changes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present work, we utilized a mouse lens-induced myopia (LIM) model to elucidate the role of macrophages in myopic scleral remodeling through the release of macrophage extracellular traps (METs). Inhibition of scleral MET release, either through genetic knockout or the MET release inhibitor lactoferrin, effectively suppressed LIM-induced myopia progression. We further investigated the factors that trigger MET release in myopic sclera. Our findings demonstrated that scleral hypoxia, in conjunction with hypoxia-activated platelets, induced autophagy in macrophages, leading to the subsequent release of METs. These findings identify a significant therapeutic target for myopia management and suggest lactoferrin as a promising pharmacological candidate for myopia prevention."}

Functional foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have gained attention for their potential for reducing CVD risk. Edible bird's nest (EBN), a functional food rich in bioactive compounds such as sialic acid, lactoferrin, and glycoproteins, has been shown to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This review explores the potential of EBN in mitigating CVD risk factors, focusing on its role in improving lipid profiles, managing obesity, and enhancing glucose metabolism. EBN has been shown to improve the lipid profile by regulating the hepatic cholesterol metabolism and gut-liver axis interactions. Additionally, EBN reduces body weight gain and visceral fat accumulation, improves adipokine regulation, and enhances insulin sensitivity, which may collectively support cardiovascular health. Despite promising findings, clinical evidence remains limited. Future research should focus on clinical trials to validate its efficacy, determine optimal dosages, and assess its long-term safety. Additionally, further studies on EBN's effects on hypertension and its interaction with conventional therapies could enhance its potential role in CVD prevention and management."}

This study aimed to elucidate the pathological features of thrombus-associated amyloid deposition by immunohistochemistry combined with proteomic analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with laser microdissection. Our findings revealed that thrombus-associated amyloid deposits within the thrombus and vessel wall primarily comprised apolipoprotein A-I, with a mixture of amyloid fibrils derived from amyloidogenic proteins, including transthyretin and lactoferrin. Given that these proteins are present in the blood, our results support a previous hypothesis that proteins denatured during thrombus aging are a source of amyloid. Furthermore, phagocytes were infiltrated around the intramural and extravascular deposits rather than around the amyloid deposits within the thrombus. Therefore, amyloid deposits generated within the thrombus may be transported from regions with limited blood flow to the vessel wall and surrounding tissues, where blood flow is present, during thrombus processing. These deposits were primarily removed by phagocytic cells. Our results suggest that a facilitative effect on deposition occurs via a cross-seeding mechanism between amyloid fibrils and that phagocytes can remove amyloid deposits. These findings help elucidate the pathogenesis of localized amyloidosis."}

We found substantial negative Trx 1 and LF correlations with rheumatoid factor in RA (r=-0.254, p=0.05 and r=-0.238, p=0.014, respectively). The correlations of thioredoxin and lactoferrin with other disease markers, such as anti-CCP antibodies, DAS28, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, and IL6 were not statistically significant. A strong positive correlation between Trx 1 and LF was observed in the study group of RA patients (r=0.519, p<0.0001) but not in the control group. Thioredoxin and lactoferrin were associated with rheumatoid factor but not with anti-CCP antibodies and systemic disease activity; therefore, the two proteins may serve as new biomarkers for assessing pathological changes and monitoring disease severity and progression in RA.

Neuroendocrine deficiencies affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axes are well-known but the mechanisms underlying prolactin secretion in CP patients are unclear. This study analyzed the factors associated with prolactin serum concentrations in CP patients. Patients with adamantinomatous CP, diagnosed as children, adolescents or young adults (< 26 years) were included in this study. In 98 cases, serum prolactin concentrations were measured before breakfast after fasting for at least 10 h, using an electrochemiluminescence assay, with concentrations analyzed for associations with diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic parameters. Serum prolactin concentrations were within normal, age- and gender-specific ranges in 39 cases (38%), with decreased concentrations in 22 cases (21%) and elevated concentrations in 37 cases (36%). Factors positively associated with increased prolactin levels were age at CP diagnosis, degree of surgical resection, and suprasellar tumor location. Decreased prolactin levels correlated with irradiation and pituitary deficiencies of thyroid-stimulating hormone and vasopressin. Patients with decreased prolactin concentrations exhibited lower event-free survival. Prolactin concentrations were not associated with functional capacity, tumor volume, calcifications, or anthropometric parameters at diagnosis or at the time of study. Prolactin levels in CP patients are influenced by the impact of the tumor on the hypothalamic-pituitary axes, resulting in either increased or decreased serum concentrations. Prolactin levels could serve as a clinical marker for certain sequelae after CP diagnosis. Patients with abnormal prolactin levels should be monitored for signs of hypothalamic syndrome.

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "prolactin", "text": "As modern endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) becomes increasingly refined, patients with large prolactinomas may seek alternatives to lifelong dopamine agonist (DA) therapy. This may raise interest in reassessing potential treatment paradigms and surgical outcomes, particularly in patients who have had long-standing symptoms and sought a more definitive solution. The objective of this study was to explore the viability of EES in experienced centers as a reliable alternative to managing macroprolactinomas. A multicentric cohort of patients with histologically proven macroprolactinoma treated with EES over 12 years was retrospectively reviewed. Early surgical results and the determinant factors of outcome were analyzed using a multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves. A total of 76 patients with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 42.1 \u00b1 15.6 years and tumor diameter of 22.7 \u00b1 12.1 mm was included. Gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 56.6%, with Knosp grade (OR 0.167, CI 0.044-0.633, p = 0.008) and clival invasion (OR 0.119, CI 0.019-0.765, p = 0.025) being the only independent predictors. Short-term remission (52/76 patients [68.4%]) was less frequent in patients with cystic tumors (OR 0.004, CI 0.0001-0.0911, p = 0.04) and was higher in those with intended (OR 36.375, CI 1.627-813.128, p = 0.023) or achieved (OR 32.341, CI 1.487-703.558, p = 0.027) GTR in multivariate analysis. The second half of the learning curve showed early complication rates of 41% versus 16.2% in the first half (p = 0.01). During a mean 47.9 \u00b1 33 months of follow-up, the permanent complication rate was 6.6% and 3/51 patients (5.9%) had recurrence. Overall 4-year recurrence-free survival was significantly lower in DA-dependent patients (70% vs 100%, p < 0.001). Last follow-up prolactin levels were positively correlated with postoperative day 1 levels (correlation coefficient 0.403, p < 0.001), with final normoprolactinemia rates significantly higher in the GTR group than in the non-GTR group (76.7 vs 45.2%, p = 0.005). DA-resistant/intolerant patients achieved significant prolactin levels reduction (576 to 17 \u00b5g/L, p < 0.001), with normal prolactin level in 51.1% of patients and long-term remission in 35.6%. The overall long-term DA-free remission rate was 39.3%, with the highest preoperative prolactin level (OR 0.999, CI 0.996-0.998, p = 0.042) being the only independent predictor of failure. Subgroup analysis showed remission rates of 80% versus 23.9% in patients with the highest preoperative prolactin levels < 150 versus \u2265 150 \u00b5g/L, respectively (p < 0.001). The authors found that modern EES in multidisciplinary centers was a low-morbid option for patients with macroprolactinoma. Remission rates were consistent with those of recent studies with variably sized prolactinomas, and recurrence rates were low. Although not universally definitive for macroprolactinomas, early EES can be offered for patients with the highest preoperative prolactin levels below 150 \u00b5g/L who are unwilling to receive long-term medication. Radiological criteria alone should not be the sole factor in surgical decision-making."}

The aim of this study was to investigate cancer risk in a nation-wide cohort of patients with a diagnosis of HPL, with special emphasis on breast cancer. In this Swedish population-based cohort study, we used nationwide registries to identify 3837 patients (2955 [77%] women) with HPL, treated with dopamine agonists (DA), diagnosed between 2006 and 2019, along with 38370 controls matched by age, sex, calendar year and county of residence at first HPL diagnosis. Cancer outcomes (overall and specific types) as registered in the Swedish Cancer Registry, were analyzed using Cox regression, internally stratified by the matching variables and additionally adjusted for diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, alcohol overconsumption, hormone replacement therapy and educational level to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). During a median follow-up time of 6.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.4-9.6), 168 (4.6%) new cases of cancer were identified in patients with HPL and 1608 (4.4%) in the control group (aHR 1.05 [95% CI: 0.89-1.23]). Twenty-eight (0.7%) patients (all women) in the HPL group and 267 (0.7%) in the control group developed breast cancer, (aHR 1.02 [95% CI: 0.68-1.51]).

However, the precise impact of SJL on the liver has remained poorly elucidated. The rhythmicity of circulating prolactin (PRL) was evaluated in subjects with SJL and mice under SJL. The causative mechanism of SJL on fatty liver was explored using jetlag model in wild-type and Prl SJL increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), mediated by the disruption of the rhythmicity of serum PRL. In particular, SJL inhibits the rhythmic transcription of PRL in the pituitary, leading to desynchronized PRL levels in circulation. Under jetlag conditions, the rhythmicity of the hepatic PRL signaling pathway was significantly dampened, which resulted in increased lipogenesis via inhibited hepatic mitogen-activated protein kinase/cyclin D1 expressions. Notably, PRL treatment at PRL nadir in jetlagged mice decreased hepatic lipid content and liver injury markers to a greater extent compared with conventional PRL administration. Reprogrammed hepatic PRL signaling pathway with concomitant dysregulated lipid metabolism homeostasis was the causative mechanism of fatty liver under SJL, which was mediated through derailed serum PRL rhythm. Restoration of PRL rhythm could effectively alleviate SJL-induced fatty liver, providing new insight into treating MASLD."}

This study aimed to analyze the association between exposure to phthalate mixtures, semen quality, and reproductive hormone concentrations in Japanese men seeking fertility treatment. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 197 Japanese adult males who visited clinics for infertility consultations in 2020 and 2021. Semen samples were collected to measure volume, sperm count, sperm concentration, and motility. Spot urine samples were collected to quantify phthalate monoesters, specifically phthalate diester metabolites, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Serum concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were obtained from clinical records. Three statistical methods-weighted quantile sum regression, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian kernel machine regression-were applied. Urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolite mixtures were positively associated with sperm motility, with monoethyl phthalate being the most important contributor to the observed association. No significant associations were found between phthalate mixtures and semen volume, sperm count, or concentration. These associations were consistent across all three statistical methods. Higher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolite mixtures were associated with lower testosterone and higher prolactin concentrations in serum; however, there were no significant associations between phthalate mixtures or individual phthalate metabolites and estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone concentrations. Higher exposure to phthalate mixtures may be associated with increased sperm motility and serum prolactin and reduced serum testosterone concentrations. Overall, these findings suggest that even at a relatively low level, exposure to phthalate mixtures may affect male reproductive health."}

Limited evidence suggests that MDMA may also stimulate the anterior pituitary. Therefore, this analysis aimed to investigate the acute effect of MDMA on the anterior pituitary in healthy adults. This secondary analysis utilized data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized trial. Healthy participants received a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in random order. Plasma hormone levels of the anterior pituitary (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], prolactin, growth hormone [GH] and their peripheral endocrine glands (cortisol, free thyroxine [fT4], testosterone, estradiol) were measured at baseline and 120 minutes after drug-intake. Plasma hormone changes following MDMA vs placebo were compared using paired Wilcoxon test. Fifteen healthy participants (median [IQR] age: 35 years [26-48]; 53% female) with a mean (SD) BMI of 23.2 kg/m2 (2.1), were included. MDMA stimulated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with plasma ACTH increasing from 12 ng/L [11, 15] at baseline to 38 ng/L [25, 59] at 120 minutes, resulting in a significant change of ACTH (p<0.001). This was accompanied by a cortisol increase from 347 nmol/L [252, 409] to 566 nmol/L [457, 701], resulting in a significant change of cortisol (p=0.006). Prolactin showed a mild change of 4 \u00b5g/L [-1,12] (p=0.062). No effects of MDMA were observed on the remaining anterior pituitary axes. MDMA strongly activates the HPA axis, in addition to stimulating oxytocin, suggesting that MDMA may serve as a novel stimulation test for assessing the two pituitary axes simultaneously.

All patients diagnosed with isolated oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, or teratozoospermia in the preoperative semen analysis were included. Men with multiple sperm defects, genetic abnormalities, azoospermia, history of genitourinary infection, exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or prior use of peri-operative fertility treatment were excluded. Data extracted from the electronic medical records included (collected before MSV and up to 6 months postoperatively): demographics (age), clinical data (fertility-related medical history and surgical interventions), family history (consanguinity and infertility), physical examination findings from general and local genital exam (varicocele side and grade), laboratory data such as semen analysis, sperm DNA fragmentation tests, and hormone levels (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, estradiol, and prolactin), and imaging (scrotal color Doppler ultrasound).

{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "prolactin", "text": "During the post-partum period, new mothers are vulnerable to mood disorders. In adults, impairments in neurogenesis commonly associate with anxiety and depressive behaviors. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is expressed in the choroid plexus (CP) within the subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche, and global loss of IGF2 leads to increased anxiety. Previously, we have shown that Igf2 expression in CP tissue increases 6-fold during lactation but returns to baseline on suppression of prolactin present in lactation, suggesting it is induced by high levels of prolactin. To gain more insight into the role of prolactin-induced Igf2 expression in the CP, we have measured IGF2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid across reproductive states and developed mice in which Igf2 is conditionally removed from the CP. Using CP-derived IGF2 knockout mouse models, we have measured Prlr expression in CP tissue, SVZ mitogenesis, olfaction, and anxiety-like behavior using an elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark transition test (LDTT). Interestingly, we observed a reduction in Prlr expression in CP tissue in one of our Igf2 knockout mouse models, suggesting Igf2 may also act upstream to regulate Prlr expression in CP tissue. No changes were detected in SVZ proliferation rates between Igf2 knockout and controls. Using a buried food test (BFT), however, we show mice with conditional loss of Igf2 in the CP take longer to find a buried fruit loop as compared to controls, indicating olfaction deficits. Overall anxiety levels, however, were comparable between knockout and controls in the EPM and LDTT. Together, our findings reveal loss of CP-derived IGF2 leads to hyposmia in the absence of detectable changes to SVZ mitogenesis. We propose that CP-derived IGF2 may be acting directly in the olfactory bulb to elicit changes to improve olfaction, which may become particularly important during the post-partum period to facilitate mother-pup interactions."}

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large suprasellar mass with sellar extension, diffusion restriction, and hemorrhagic components. The radiological differential diagnoses included papillary craniopharyngioma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and high-grade glioma.

PDX1 is phosphorylated by CK2 and inhibition of this kinase results in an increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion. Therefore, we speculated in this study that CK2 also affects SST expression. To test this, we analyzed the effects of the two CK2 inhibitors CX-4945 and SGC as well as of PDX1 overexpression on SST expression and secretion in RIN14B cells by qRT-PCR, luciferase assays, Western blot and ELISA. SST expression and secretion were additionally assessed in isolated murine and human islets exposed to the CK2 inhibitors. Moreover, we determined the expression and secretion of the pancreatic endocrine hormones in CX-4945-treated mice. We found a suppressed SST expression in RIN14B cells due to a methylated SST promoter, which could be abolished by DNA demethylation. Under these conditions, we showed that CK2 inhibition increases SST gene expression and secretion. Additional experiments with overexpression of a CK2-phosphorylation mutant of PDX1 verified that SST expression is regulated by CK2. The exposure of isolated murine and human islets to CX-4945 or SGC as well as the treatment of mice with CX-4945 revealed that CK2 also regulates SST expression under physiological conditions. Taken together, these findings not only demonstrate that CK2 controls SST expression in pancreatic \u03b4-cells but also emphasize the crucial role of this kinase in regulating the main hormones of the endocrine pancreas."}

Despite this, information regarding the delta-cell architecture during diabetes is sparse. The aim of the current study was to determine intra-islet and extra-islet delta-cell architecture in the pancreas during long-standing type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic tissue from nine donors with long-standing type 1 diabetes, six donors with type 2 diabetes, and 13 donors without diabetes were obtained. Sections co-stained for somatostatin, glucagon, and insulin were manually examined. There was an approximately two-fold higher number of alpha cells directly adherent to delta cells in subjects with type 1 diabetes compared with non-diabetic subjects. The delta cells were more peripherally located within the islets of donors with type 1 diabetes. The density of extra-islet single delta cells in the acinar region was more than three-fold higher in type 1 diabetes compared with non-diabetic subjects. No differences in delta-cell architecture could be determined in type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic subjects. In conclusion, the islet delta-cell architecture in human type 1 diabetes is remodelled. The higher number of alpha cells directly adherent to delta cells in type 1 diabetes likely increases the alpha cells' exposure to somatostatin.

In addition to common ADEs such as nausea, new ADEs such as urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and nasopharyngitis are also observed. Subgroup analyses showed that there were both commonalities and disparities in signal detection among gender, age, reporter, and dosage groups. The sensitivity analyses, excluding concomitant medications, confirmed the persistence of most positive signals. In addition, the combination drug analysis revealed that certain ADEs may occur with the additional treatment of lanreotide.

The workflow is optimized for challenges unique to the islet proteome including high disulfide-linkage content and frequent truncation events, resulting in many proteoforms <5 kDa. There are limited examples of top-down proteomics characterization of human islets, thus this study provides a baseline characterization of the proteoforms of major hormones including insulin, glucagon, chromogranin-A and -B, and somatostatin. The quantitative results of proteoform abundances before and after cytokine treatment, which mimics the proinflammatory environment during T1D progression, enables the discovery of interesting proteoform candidates as potential markers of T1D progression."}
{"entity_type": "protein", "query": "somatostatin", "text": "Neurons in primary visual cortex are often suppressed by stimuli extending beyond their receptive fields. This surround suppression is proposed to reduce the redundancy of encoding large stimuli and support scene segmentation. We find that surround suppression decreases firing rates in mouse primary visual cortex by accelerating the decay of visually-evoked responses and reducing response duration. The rapid decay of visual responses at large sizes is enhanced by increased contrast, reduced by locomotion, and invariant to stimulus orientation, consistent with the engagement of a network mechanism. While fast-spiking interneurons have faster dynamics relative to neighboring pyramidal cells, the dynamics of somatostatin-expressing interneurons are delayed. At the subthreshold level, the rapid decay of visual responses with increasing size is due to a delayed removal of both synaptic excitation and inhibition below baseline levels following visual input. We propose that the delayed activation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons drives a network-wide suppression and accelerates the decay of the visual response. Thus, these data identify a key role for synaptic network dynamics in regulating both spatial and temporal integration in mouse visual cortex."}

Acute handling stress increased corticosterone concentrations as did injection with ACTH, but NPY and receptor antagonist treatments prevented this endogenous increase in corticosterone. In contrast, cortisol, and DHEA were not impacted by handling stress or ACTH, but both steroids increased in response to injection with NPY and with an established Y2 receptor antagonist. Together these data reveal the possibility that both ACTH and NPY act to regulate adrenal steroid synthesis, through a complicated and currently poorly understood mechanism.

The symptoms are similar to those of human motor neuron diseases such as primary (PLS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). BSP occurs worldwide in cattle production with an estimated prevalence of <1%. For Germany, this means that around 20,000 Holstein cattle are affected. BSP is generally considered a hereditary disease, but there is no prevention through breeding programs. As a result, BSP not only affects animal welfare but also leads to economic losses in milk and beef production. Here, we used transcriptomics to analyse the brainstem, spinal cord and affected gastrocnemius muscle tissue of eight animals affected by BSP and eight control animals from slaughterhouses to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying BSP. We found that the expression of several genes was significantly different in animals affected by BSP compared to control animals. Specific genes for inhibitory neurons were downregulated in the brainstems of the affected animals, namely CCK (cholecystokinin), NPY (neuropeptide Y), and SST (somatostatin). These inhibitory neurotransmitters influence cerebral movement control, among other processes. Furthermore, OOSP2 (oocyte secreted protein 2) was found to be significantly upregulated in the affected animals in all tissues. This expression could best be explained by the presence of T-follicular-helper cells which, through interleukin 21, can trigger a TH-2-dominated immune response and lead to autoimmune encephalitis. Further cases were sampled for confirmation and we detected cell infiltrates of activated microglia and T-cells in the brainstem using immunohistochemistry. Microglial foci were significantly more abundant in animals affected by BSP than control animals. We conclude that BSP is caused by an autoimmune reaction directed against inhibitory interneurons in the brainstem and is due to a combination of genetics and environmental influences. This may result in lost controlling influence on the upper motor neurons via extrapyramidal pathways and therefore triggers the specific symptoms of motor neuron disease."}

These conflicting results highlight the need for further investigation into the role of GH signaling in longevity across species. To address this gap, we developed a novel GH-deficient rat model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce a 10 bp deletion in exon 3 of the gene encoding rat GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) yielding a non-functional GHRH product. Physiological characterization of GHRH knockout (KO) rats revealed that they were half the body weight of wild-type controls. Additionally, relative to controls, they displayed an increased percent body fat, enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentration, and a decreased reliance on glucose oxidation for energy metabolism, as determined by indirect calorimetry. Analysis of the gut microbial community in adult GHRH-KO rats further revealed a less diverse male microbiome, but a more diverse female KO microbiome compared to controls.

Identifying alexamorelin and/or its metabolite biomarkers is crucial for effective doping controls. The purpose of this study was to determine and characterize biomarkers associated with alexamorelin intake. In silico metabolite predictions were performed using GLORYx freeware, and in vitro incubations were conducted with pooled human hepatocytes from 10 donors. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS), with data processed through Thermo Scientific's Compound Discoverer. GLORYx predicted 21 single-reaction metabolites. N-Acetylation was identified as the primary transformation, with the highest probability score (98%), and occurring either at the C-terminal Ala or the N-terminal Lys. Other predicted transformations included N-oxidation, hydroxylation, amide hydrolysis, oxidative deamination, and phase II N-glucuronidation, with probability scores below 40%. All these transformations were predicted to occur at the two C-terminal (Ala or His) or N-terminal (D-Phe or Lys) amino acids.

Relatively hypermethylated CpGs were enriched for Hippo, B-cell and growth hormone receptor signaling. Functional enrichment suggested potential regulatory roles for active enhancers and histone modifications. Additionally, enrichment in PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways in males and enrichment in hormonal pathways in females was identified. Gaussian graphical models identified sex-differential DNA-methylation nodes and hub scores at birth and childhood. Integrating with previously identified polygenic risk scores for asthma and drug-target enrichment identified seven robust genes including Epigenetic variability from birth through puberty provides mechanistic insights into fetal programming of developmental and immune pathways associated with lung function. These early life observations reveal potential targets for mitigating risk for lung function decline and asthma progression in later life. We identified consistent DNA methylation signatures between birth and childhood in critical metabolic, lung development and immune pathways that were associated with lung function and may be influenced by sex and genetics.Our integrative findings provide a deeper understanding for accelerated lung function decline across the life-course and could pave the way for translational interventions for lung diseases based on epigenetic plasticity."}

NF-kB is an evolutionarily conserved TF complex primarily involved in innate immunity and inflammation. The extent to which TEs have contributed to NF-kB responses during mammalian evolution is not well established. Here, we performed a multi-species analysis of TEs bound by the NF-kB subunit RELA in response to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. By comparing RELA ChIP-seq data from TNF-stimulated primary aortic endothelial cells isolated from human, mouse, and cow, we find that 55 TE subfamilies are associated with RELA-bound regions, many of which reside near TNF-responsive genes. A prominent example of lineage-specific contribution of transposons comes from the bovine SINE subfamilies Bov-tA1/2/3 which collectively contributed over 14,000 RELA-bound regions in cow. By comparing RELA binding data across species, we also find several examples of RELA motif-bearing TEs that colonized the genome prior to the divergence of the three species and contributed to species-specific RELA binding. For example, we find human RELA-bound MER81 instances are enriched for the interferon gamma pathway and demonstrate that one RELA-bound MER81 element can control the TNF-induced expression of interferon gamma receptor 2 ("}

Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people with MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the aging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA. We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50 \u00b5g/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24 h. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR. Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7 \u00b1 12.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (\u03b2=-0.003, p < 0.001). Among the subgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (\u03b2=-0.27, p = 0.04) but not men (\u03b2=-0.1, p = 0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.6% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory analyses, older pwMS (\u2265 50 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines than younger pwMS (< 50 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) mediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR. Diminished peripheral IL-17 response as a potential biological mechanism underlying the aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA warrants further investigation."}

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a fundamental role in cholesterol transport. By contrast, its oxidized form (ox-LDL), which is overexpressed in conditions of obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation, has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. Depending on the microenvironmental context, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) participates in various scenarios such as inflammation, anti-inflammation, and homeostasis. Therefore, obesity-derived biomolecules such as LDL, ox-LDL, and PGE2 could induce the differentiation of immune cells into effector populations with either pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive profiles. In the present work, we studied the effects of LDL, ox-LDL, and PGE2 on the differentiation of the human THP1 monocytic cell line into macrophages under two different protocols, analyzing several activation markers associated with either pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 profiles by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our data suggest that native LDL induces the differentiation of human THP1 monocytes into M1 macrophages even more efficiently than classic phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, whereas ox-LDL and PGE2 induce the expression of activation markers similarly to interferon gamma or interleukin 4 during PMA preactivation of macrophages. The results of this study add evidence to the role of obesity-derived biomolecules as non-canonical differentiation stimuli in macrophages, which could be relevant in contexts where these biomolecules are chronically overproduced, such as obesity, low-grade inflammation, type 2 diabetes, and cancer."}

The current view in the field posits that IFN-\u03b3-mediated elimination of LS is executed by the induction of intra-hepatocytic nitric oxide (NO). Here, we refute this view and instead show that IFN-\u03b3-driven induction of non-canonical autophagy via gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated proteins (GABARAPs) has a critical functional role in IFN-\u03b3-mediated elimination of LS. Furthermore, mediators of lysosomal maturation and fusion also have important functions in this process. Recruitment of GABARAPs to the LS parasitophorous vacuole (PV) compartment likely promotes the fusion of the PV membrane with lysosomes, thereby leading to elimination of intra-hepatocytic parasites. In contrast, LC3 has an infection-supportive function by protecting LS from GABARAP-mediated elimination. We also found an important role of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing protein NOX2, indicating a two-pronged host response drives LS elimination."}

Through integrated analysis of single-cell transcription sequence data, we identified aberrant upregulation of Lamin B2 (LMNB2) specifically in immunotherapy-sensitive HCC patients. Functional characterization revealed that LMNB2 acts as a transcriptional regulator of PD-L1, potentiating immune escape mechanisms in HCC cells during co-culture with Jurkat cells. Notably, we discovered that speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) directly interacts with LMNB2 to mediate its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining physiological PD-L1 expression levels. Clinically relevant SPOP mutations or reduced SPOP expression impaired this regulatory mechanism, leading to LMNB2 accumulation and subsequent PD-L1 hyperactivation. Importantly, combinatorial targeting of LMNB2 with Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) displayed a synergistic effect on suppressing tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo, particularly in HCC models with SPOP mutations or LMNB2 overexpression. These findings unveil a novel ubiquitination-dependent regulatory axis in HCC immune evasion and propose targeted co-inhibition strategies to overcome HCC immunotherapy resistance."}

Ubiquitin-specific protease 38 (USP38) has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in CKD-related ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is yet to be clarified. This research systematically explores the involvement of USP38 in the development of VAs in CKD. This study employed cardiac-specific Usp38 knockout and transgenic Usp38 mice, along with H9c2 cells transduced with adenoviral vectors carrying Usp38 (AdUsp38) or shRNA targeting Usp38 (AdshUsp38). The mouse model was generated via 5/6 nephrectomy, and CKD cell models were created using indoxyl sulfate (IS) induction. These models underwent extensive evaluation, including echocardiography, electrophysiology, histological studies, and molecular analysis. In CKD mouse models, USP38 expression was markedly elevated and predominantly localized in ventricular myocytes. Knocking out Usp38 markedly decreased the susceptibility and duration of rapid VAs in CKD mice and corrected the abnormal expression of ion channel proteins. Comparable findings were observed in Usp38 transgenic mouse models. From a mechanistic perspective, Usp38 knockout reduced oxidative stress in cardiac tissues and upregulated antioxidative enzyme expression. The enhancement was mainly achieved by increasing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) ubiquitination and degradation, along with inhibition of downstream CaMKII activity. In contrast, USP38 overexpression had harmful effects on the heart, which were alleviated by NOX4 inhibition. This study demonstrated that USP38 stabilizes NOX4 expression via deubiquitination, resulting in increased oxidative stress and hyperphosphorylation of CaMKII, which markedly enhances the susceptibility of CKD mice to VAs. These findings underscore the critical regulatory role of USP38 in CKD-related arrhythmias, providing a promising therapeutic target for USP38-directed treatments."}

However, the generation of reagents for measuring DUB activity typically involves several steps and is not straight forward. Here, we report the development and characterization of a novel fluorescent polarization assay using an isopeptide bond substrate mimetic (IsoMim) that can be made recombinantly in high yields. The IsoMim assay was able to discern the differential activity of ubiquitin specific protease family members (USP4, USP15, USP11 and USP2), the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL3 and the Machado-Joseph Domain deubiquitinase JOSD2. A competition assay format of the assay was developed that discerned differences between the close paralogues USP15, USP4 and USP11 in interacting with mono-ubiquitin, the isopeptide mimetic ubiquitin-GGG and the C-terminal truncation variant ubiquitin (1-74). Moreover, dose-response curves and associated pIC50 values using the broad-spectrum inhibitor PR-619 confirmed differential inhibition in the low \u03bcM range for four tested DUBs. The successful discrimination of DUB activity and inhibition, and the easily scalable generation of the substrate make the IsoMim assay method applicable for high-throughput screening (HTS). This was ascertained in a 'pseudo HTS screen' for USP4 inhibitors in which PR-619 was successfully identified as a 'pseudo hit'. The developed assay provides a valuable tool for probing DUB activity and the identification and characterization of DUB inhibitors and has the potential to accelerate drug discovery efforts in this area."}

This study explored its involvement in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Bioinformatics analysis assessed FHL2 expression and survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR, and Western blotting (WB) were performed to assess FHL2 levels in LUSC tissue microarrays (TMA) and cell lines. In vitro, CCK-8, plate colony formation, wound healing, and Matrigel Transwell assays were conducted to investigate the effects of FHL2 on LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo, xenograft tumor models were utilized to evaluate the role of FHL2 in LUSC progression. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation (IP) and proximity ligation assays (PLA) were performed to explore the interaction between FHL2 and c-Jun. The cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was conducted to assess c-Jun stability in the context of FHL2 overexpression or knockdown. The influence of differential FHL2 expression on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway was analyzed via WB. Furthermore, xenograft tumor models, WB, and IHC were employed to determine whether FHL2 mediates LUSC resistance to afatinib. FHL2 expression was significantly upregulated in LUSC tissues, as demonstrated by the TCGA database analysis and validated through IHC staining of TMA. Moreover, elevated FHL2 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in LUSC patients. FHL2 overexpression enhanced LUSC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro while accelerating xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, FHL2 knockdown exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, FHL2 interacts with c-Jun and suppresses its ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the c-Jun protein, upregulating PDK1 expression, and subsequently activating the PAM signaling pathway. Notably, FHL2 overexpression induced afatinib resistance in LUSC cells, and patients with afatinib resistance exhibited high levels of FHL2 expression. Our results demonstrate that FHL2 promotes LUSC progression and induces afatinib resistance by regulating the PAM signaling pathway. FHL2 may serve as a crucial prognostic marker for the survival outcomes of LUSC patients and a promising therapeutic target for their treatment."}

However, the E3 ligase of TGFBR2 was not known. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac fibroblasts, we identified C-terminal interacting protein of HSP70 (CHIP) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase utilized by BAG3 for TGFBR2 degradation in cardiac fibroblasts. Overexpression of CHIP significantly decreased TGFBR2 stability, while inhibition of CHIP led to increased sensitivity to TGF-\u03b2 and subsequent promotion of a fibrogenic program. Further, the BAG3-HSP70 interaction was crucial to this process, as disruption of the axis increased TGFBR2 stability and sensitivity to TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Together, these findings demonstrate that the BAG3-HSP70-CHIP axis controls TGF-\u03b2 signaling in cardiac fibroblasts and could serve as a new therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis."}

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically regulate ferroptosis by modulating the stability, activity, and interactions of key proteins such as GPX4, SLC7A11, and ACSL4. A single protein can undergo multiple PTMs, and the same regulatory enzyme may exert opposing effects on ferroptosis by modifying different proteins. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of PTMs in regulatory proteins is essential for elucidating their overall impact on ferroptosis. This review systematically examines the roles of ubiquitination, ubiquitin-like modifications (e.g. UFMylation, SUMOylation), alkylation, and succination in ferroptosis regulation. We highlight how E3 ligases, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and other PTM-associated enzymes modulate ferroptosis by governing the degradation or stabilization of key targets, thereby influencing redox homeostasis and iron metabolism. Clinically, PTM-targeting agents, including E3 ligase modulators and SUMOylation inhibitors, demonstrate therapeutic potential in preclinical models, though their clinical translation remains in its early stages. This review underscores the complexity of PTM-mediated ferroptosis regulation and highlights the need to explore PTM crosstalk, refine therapeutic strategies, and develop novel PTM modulators for the treatment of malignancies and iron-related disorders."}

The KYDS rat model was induced via intraperitoneal injection of hydrocortisone. Body weight, body temperature, sperm motility, serum hormone levels, organ indices, and histopathological changes of rats were evaluated. AQP1 was knocked down to detect the effect of AQP1 on lipid metabolism in KYDS rats. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation were used to verify the relationship between CBL and AQP1, and CBL knockdown KYDS rats were constructed to test the effect of CBL on AQP1 ubiquitination. AQP1 expression was downregulated in KYDS rats. Knockdown of the AQP1 gene in KYDS rats resulted in decreased body weight, body temperature, sperm motility, and testicular index, along with increased renal index. It also resulted in changes of serum hormone levels and exacerbated pathologic changes. Additionally, AQP1 knockdown further suppressed lipid accumulation in KYDS rats, as evidenced by reductions in lipid droplets and the expression of lipid synthesis proteins. Intriguingly, elevated expression of CBL was observed in KYDS, and its knockdown inhibited the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AQP1. The inhibition of CBL in KYDS improved lipid metabolism dysregulation, thereby ameliorating KYDS. CBL-mediated AQP1 ubiquitination aggravates KYDS by promoting lipid metabolism dysregulation, offering promising insights for targeted therapeutic interventions."}

While fatty acid (FA) metabolism can potentiate tumorigenesis, colonization, and metastasis, the roles of lncRNAs in reprograming FA metabolism and regulating gastric cancer (GC) metastasis remain elusive. Whole RNA-sequencing and in silico analyses were conducted to identify clinically significant lncRNAs involved in GC metastasis. Among the identified lncRNAs, we focused on the novel lncRNA TENM3-AS1. RT-qPCR and FISH analyses revealed an increased expression of TENM3-AS1 in GC cell lines and patients. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments validated the effects of TENM3-AS1 to GC metastasis and the reprogramming of FA metabolism. ChIP, Biotinylated RNA pull-down, RIP, CHX-chase assay, ubiquitination assay, and RNA stabilization assay were employed to perceive the mechanisms underlying the effects of TENM3-AS1 in GC cells. TENM3-AS1 expression was significantly elevated in metastatic tumors and advanced primary tumors of GC patients. This increased expression was also associated with a worsened overall survival and progression-free survival. Functionally, TENM3-AS1 enhanced the migration and invasiveness of GC cells in vitro, promoted tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo, and increased FA biosynthesis in GC cells. Mechanistically, our studies showed that the transcription factor EGR1 activated TENM3-AS1, which in turn upregulated the expression of FASN and hnRNPK. Furthermore, TENM3-AS1 interacted with and stabilized hnRNPK by increasing its deubiquitination. This interaction reprogrammed FA metabolism and promoted GC progression by increasing FASN mRNA stability through hnRNPK. In this study, by comparing lncRNA sequencing data from paired primary and peritoneal metastatic tumors and public transcriptome data from non-metastatic and metastatic samples, we clarified a novel lncRNA, TENM3-AS1. It was found that TENM3-AS1 was aberrantly activated in metastatic and advanced primary tumors, and was strongly correlated with a shorter survival in GC patients. Our study reveals the EGR1/TENM3-AS1/ hnRNPK/FASN axis as a novel curative target in metastatic GC."}

This study evaluated the anticancer effects of gilteritinib on PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) by assessing cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Mechanistic studies were conducted to determine its impact on the cell cycle, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Additionally, the mode of cell death was explored, focusing on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein ubiquitination. Gilteritinib exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited PCa cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. It induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest by downregulating CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin E1. EMT modulation was observed through the suppression of vimentin, N-cadherin, and Twist, along with increased E-cadherin expression. This EMT inhibition correlated with the downregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling components. Notably, gilteritinib triggered a non-apoptotic, non-autophagic cell death characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolation, ER stress, and protein ubiquitination, requiring new protein synthesis. This effect was mediated through the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) via the PERK pathway. Gilteritinib demonstrates significant anticancer potential in PCa by inducing cell cycle arrest, inhibiting EMT, suppressing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, and triggering a unique mode of cell death via ER stress.

SMAD5 silencing suppressed viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while its overexpression had opposite effects. USP53 deubiquitinated SMAD5 to stabilize its protein expression. Moreover, USP53 knockdown inhibited viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while these effects were reverted by SMAD5 overexpression. EIF4A3 stabilized USP53 mRNA expression, and the inhibitory effect of EIF4A3 silencing on viability, invasion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was abolished by USP53 overexpression.
